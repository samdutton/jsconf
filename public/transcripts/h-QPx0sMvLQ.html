<p><span data-start="62.9" data-end="68.679">If you have questions, you can follow me on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="68.679" data-end="75.24">I can talk to you at the after party where finally I can get excited and not have to</span> <span data-start="75.24" data-end="78.779">go to bed early!</span> <span data-start="78.779" data-end="81.979">This story is pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="81.979" data-end="86.719">When I was a little girl, every morning, I was really terrible at brushing my hair.</span> <span data-start="86.719" data-end="90.09">That seems likes yeah, how does this fit into a JavaScript conference?</span> <span data-start="90.09" data-end="91.709">I promise it is coming.</span> <span data-start="91.709" data-end="97.78">When I was little, I was terrible at brushing my hair, and my mom would help me brush it</span> <span data-start="97.78" data-end="98.78">out.</span> <span data-start="98.78" data-end="100.259">Every morning, I had a question for her.</span> <span data-start="100.259" data-end="106.06">The question was, "What do you think I'm going to be when I grow up?"</span> <span data-start="106.06" data-end="108.6">My mom came up with a different answer every morning.</span> <span data-start="108.6" data-end="111.999">He said, "I think you're going to be an astronaut."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="111.999" data-end="113.869">I went to space camp.</span> <span data-start="113.869" data-end="116.899">I said what am I going to be when I grow up?</span> <span data-start="116.899" data-end="121.079">"I think you're going to be a baker."</span> <span data-start="121.079" data-end="127.599">I think yes, I could be a baker too.</span> <span data-start="127.599" data-end="132.48">Every morning, she would tell me a different answer, and I realised one morning, she wasn't</span> <span data-start="132.48" data-end="135.12">going to give me an answer that was right.</span> <span data-start="135.12" data-end="139.09">She couldn't predict the future, so I just stopped asking.</span> <span data-start="139.09" data-end="140.25">It was that sudden.</span> <span data-start="140.25" data-end="144.86">But I think it is that simple routine that really cemented my belief that I could do</span> <span data-start="144.86" data-end="146.22">anything.</span> <span data-start="146.22" data-end="154.689">But telling that story, the reason I tell you, it is because I think small actions have</span> <span data-start="154.689" data-end="156.7">a really big impact in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.7" data-end="161.84">And, in JavaScript, we're so wrapped up in the immediacy, so wrapped up in seeing results</span> <span data-start="161.84" data-end="168.17">like right now, and we've heard people talk about shaving off milliseconds, and, when</span> <span data-start="168.17" data-end="174.62">it comes to JavaScript, that stuff is really, really cool, but it also has sort of a darker</span> <span data-start="174.62" data-end="179.459">backside where we sort of forget that the actions that we take right now can sometimes</span> <span data-start="179.459" data-end="183.219">take months or even years to see the full effect.</span> <span data-start="183.219" data-end="187.51">When I talk about full effect, I'm talking about in the community, not just in the browser,</span> <span data-start="187.51" data-end="193.53">but in the people that surround us, and so what may seem like these small, trivial, almost</span> <span data-start="193.53" data-end="199.39">kitschy behaviours can become significant in ways we didn't imagine.</span> <span data-start="199.39" data-end="204.969">When I told you the story about me brushing my hair, it seemed silly, but it was impactful</span> <span data-start="204.969" data-end="211.61">in how I saw myself as a person in the world — like what can I really be when I grow up?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.61" data-end="216.079">Throughout this talk, I want you to think not just who you can be when you grow up,</span> <span data-start="216.079" data-end="217.98">but who can the community be?</span> <span data-start="217.98" data-end="222.999">Who can JavaScript be?</span> <span data-start="222.999" data-end="225.09">What is JavaScript going to look like in the future?</span> <span data-start="225.09" data-end="231.849">So I think another thing to think about is our community really needs leaders.</span> <span data-start="231.849" data-end="237.719">The JavaScript community and the people who embrace JavaScript grow, it becomes ever more</span> <span data-start="237.719" data-end="243.81">important we need the kind, gentle guidance that my mom gave me when I was a little kid.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.81" data-end="250">But the big thing is that it's not going to be a parent or standards body like TC39 that</span> <span data-start="250" data-end="254.159">maybe leads the way and says, "This is what is going to happen."</span> <span data-start="254.159" data-end="258.92">It's not going to come from one individual person, and it's not going to come from a</span> <span data-start="258.92" data-end="265.27">tiny little group of people, but instead, leadership is going to come by the many and</span> <span data-start="265.27" data-end="270.8">not by the few, so it is not one person, it's all of us, and so it is the responsibility</span> <span data-start="270.8" data-end="276.669">of all of us just to come together and determine the legacy of the JavaScript community.</span> <span data-start="276.669" data-end="281.18">So, when I say legacy, like what is legacy even mean?</span> <span data-start="281.18" data-end="287.3">I think a lot of times in software, we tend to associate the word "legacy" and specifically</span> <span data-start="287.3" data-end="292.86">legacy in the sense of code as being old, broken, irrelevant, as something that is really</span> <span data-start="292.86" data-end="298.93">almost negative, like when was the last time that you heard someone talk about legacy software?</span> <span data-start="298.93" data-end="306.24">And like a in a great and exciting way, and I can't wait to get this on my marsh working?</span> <span data-start="306.24" data-end="312.449">I think that that sort of sad because originally, when the word "legacy" originated in the 14th</span> <span data-start="312.449" data-end="316.28">century, it had a completely different meaning.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.28" data-end="320.75">That meaning was a lot more affirmative, a lot more positive, and it was this: a body</span> <span data-start="320.75" data-end="324.699">of Terence sent on a mission.</span> <span data-start="324.699" data-end="327.682">So  —  a body of persons sent on a mission.</span> <span data-start="327.682" data-end="333.93">What I like to refer to when I think of legacy is that this is who we are as JavaScripters.</span> <span data-start="333.93" data-end="339.509">We're a body of persons sent on a mission to shape the world, not just through our code</span> <span data-start="339.509" data-end="344.9">but also by our vision for the future of the language and the people that surround it.</span> <span data-start="344.9" data-end="351.03">Seeing ourselves in this way, like seeing ourselves as part of this living legacy, as</span> <span data-start="351.03" data-end="355.71">stewards of the greater good, is critical for two really important reasons.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.71" data-end="357.41">Agency and empowerment.</span> <span data-start="357.41" data-end="364.27">When I say agency, I mean we don't need to wait for the permission of someone else to</span> <span data-start="364.27" data-end="369.68">make a change or to lead or to take charge, and so this ability to shape the direction</span> <span data-start="369.68" data-end="375.72">and influence the future of our community, like that's super impactful, and this directs</span> <span data-start="375.72" data-end="376.72">is just incredible.</span> <span data-start="376.72" data-end="382.819">I mean, when I talk about empowerment, I mean that it ensures by being active participants</span> <span data-start="382.819" data-end="388.63">rather than passive bystanders, we don't leave the hard work of care taking, the hard work</span> <span data-start="388.63" data-end="392.83">of inclusion, and the hard work of community to others.</span> <span data-start="392.83" data-end="395.22">Lucky there is everybody's job.</span> <span data-start="395.22" data-end="398.849">This is my — like in is my job, your job, everybody's job.</span> <span data-start="398.849" data-end="404.68">This is the price you pay for being a member of the JavaScript community.</span> <span data-start="404.68" data-end="410.781">So, when I say "legacy" I would like really to boil it down into two simple things, two</span> <span data-start="410.781" data-end="413.629">simple words and that is: people and progress.</span> <span data-start="413.629" data-end="421.039">I think a lot of us, it is really difficult to boil stuff down to just the most common</span> <span data-start="421.039" data-end="428.15">tiny little factor that everyone understands, but the purpose of JavaScript is people, and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="428.15" data-end="433.729">I think a lot of times, we get really mixed up because we think JavaScript is a lot of</span> <span data-start="433.729" data-end="438.759">things — like JavaScript is conferences, and JavaScript is functions, and like JavaScript</span> <span data-start="438.759" data-end="442.72">is all of these different things, but that's a mistake.</span> <span data-start="442.72" data-end="449.409">JavaScript really is the people and the community that surrounds the language and the people</span> <span data-start="449.409" data-end="453.449">that interact with it rather than just the language itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="453.449" data-end="458.199">So what I like to say when I say "legacy of the JavaScript community," when I think about</span> <span data-start="458.199" data-end="464.96">that legacy, what I think about is not JavaScript and not what new features are we going to</span> <span data-start="464.96" data-end="468.15">add, how are we going to make it faster and more impactful?</span> <span data-start="468.15" data-end="472.979">How are we going to get it running in all of the browsers so super fast and offline</span> <span data-start="472.979" data-end="479.64">first, and all these things, those are all great, but people first always.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="479.64" data-end="489.34">When we define our vision, our ideas about the legacy of the JavaScript community, maybe</span> <span data-start="489.34" data-end="494.15">it makes a little bit more sense to sort of step back in history before a sort of attempt</span> <span data-start="494.15" data-end="495.68">to merge this path forward.</span> <span data-start="495.68" data-end="502.16">When you think about it, from the earliest days, JavaScript has been a foundational technology,</span> <span data-start="502.16" data-end="506.939">and despite the central role, something really unfortunate has happened.</span> <span data-start="506.939" data-end="511.56">I think what has happened is that a lot of people tend to look down on us as JavaScript</span> <span data-start="511.56" data-end="517.65">developers, so developers who write primarily JavaScript are considered less than developers</span> <span data-start="517.65" data-end="520.12">who write code for other languages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="520.12" data-end="525.75">A lot of times because we say, "JavaScript has really broad appeal, and a lot of people</span> <span data-start="525.75" data-end="527.37">can get started with JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="527.37" data-end="530.15">It's relatively easy to use."</span> <span data-start="530.15" data-end="536.23">We use this as evidence that JavaScript has an inferior status, but it is not a real programming</span> <span data-start="536.23" data-end="537.98">language, that you're not a real developer.</span> <span data-start="537.98" data-end="542.37">I think that is just flat-out wrong, to be honest.</span> <span data-start="542.37" data-end="548.35">So these classifications, they're misguided, and I think when we look at JavaScript as</span> <span data-start="548.35" data-end="554.66">a language, it brings to light a lot of JavaScript subtleties, and the language reveals that</span> <span data-start="554.66" data-end="560.23">JavaScript is actually really, really nuanced and complex, and we look at JavaScript when</span> <span data-start="560.23" data-end="563.67">you think I've got this totally figured out, I'm going to run my function, and you run</span> <span data-start="563.67" data-end="567.84">it, and you think, "Wait."</span> <span data-start="567.84" data-end="573.22">That is a lot how we sort of need to think about the JavaScript community.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="573.22" data-end="580.03">On the surface, JavaScript may seem incredibly simple, and it may seem really easy just to</span> <span data-start="580.03" data-end="584.76">apply these stereotypical programmer tropes to say, "I know what a JavaScript developer</span> <span data-start="584.76" data-end="585.76">looks like."</span> <span data-start="585.76" data-end="592.1">But on further inspection these I think that clich�s are wrong", untruthful, misguiding,</span> <span data-start="592.1" data-end="602.6">and limited, and that's something I would really like to change.</span> <span data-start="602.6" data-end="604.96">So who hey as a community?</span> <span data-start="604.96" data-end="609.79">If we brush aside these silly ideas, who are we really?</span> <span data-start="609.79" data-end="613">What does meaning a community in the modern age really mean?</span> <span data-start="613" data-end="619.1">I think, honestly, community can be a group of members who share common characteristics</span> <span data-start="619.1" data-end="624.75">or interests and who often share a common historical and cultural heritage.</span> <span data-start="624.75" data-end="630.12">Some of you might, when I say common cultural and historical heritage, might get a little</span> <span data-start="630.12" data-end="631.7">bit shaky.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.7" data-end="633.76">Stick with me here for a second.</span> <span data-start="633.76" data-end="638.23">A superficial glance at this definition can lead us in the wrong direction.</span> <span data-start="638.23" data-end="643.04">Look at you today, what I see is incredible diversity, and having listened to all the</span> <span data-start="643.04" data-end="650.57">talks, I've heard a lot of diversity and a lot of support for diversity, and we are people</span> <span data-start="650.57" data-end="655.89">of all ages, genders, people of all backgrounds, different sorts of beliefs, and a lot of us</span> <span data-start="655.89" data-end="660.59">have different mother tongues — that's something I've noticed at JSConf EU in particular, there</span> <span data-start="660.59" data-end="664.89">are a lot of different spoken languages.</span> <span data-start="664.89" data-end="670.11">We also come from a lot of different places, and so the country that's printed on our passport</span> <span data-start="670.11" data-end="673.84">may not actually be the country that we most identify with.</span> <span data-start="673.84" data-end="678.61">And maybe it is just one part of an incredibly larger more detailed story.</span> <span data-start="678.61" data-end="684.21">So having heard all of the talks, having listened to people in the hallway, having seen everyone</span> <span data-start="684.21" data-end="689.57">interact and seeing people treat each other with so much love and respect, what I would</span> <span data-start="689.57" data-end="694.45">like to say is that it's clear that the characteristics and the interest that we share resolve around</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="694.45" data-end="700.69">JavaScript and programming, and around this need to make and build, and that is something</span> <span data-start="700.69" data-end="706.49">that, regardless of where you come from, regardless of what gender you are, regardless of how</span> <span data-start="706.49" data-end="713.52">old you are, like JavaScript and this need to make cool stuff, like that is something</span> <span data-start="713.52" data-end="715.33">that we all share.</span> <span data-start="715.33" data-end="720.79">So, when I talk about heritage, I'm not talking about our genetics, I'm not talking about</span> <span data-start="720.79" data-end="726.21">a physical place or a spoken language, but a belief in the power of the web, and, most</span> <span data-start="726.21" data-end="731.94">importantly, it is not these differences, or it is not despite these differences but</span> <span data-start="731.94" data-end="736.92">actually because of these differences that we are so uniquely prepared to share in the</span> <span data-start="736.92" data-end="739.89">mission of the web.</span> <span data-start="739.89" data-end="745.75">So, the web is here to stay, and because of that, we as JavaScripters, as individuals</span> <span data-start="745.75" data-end="751.552">and as a community, we are obligated to create and maintain the culture of the ideas, the</span> <span data-start="751.552" data-end="757.19">beliefs that will be carried forth by the next generation of JavaScripters, and those</span> <span data-start="757.19" data-end="762.45">in a future that is so distant that we can hardly imagine what it is going to become,</span> <span data-start="762.45" data-end="767.6">so the culture that we create today is going to go for the and shape the next generation</span> <span data-start="767.6" data-end="768.6">of JavaScripters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="768.6" data-end="773.03">Whether we actually intend for it or not, that's something that's going to happen.</span> <span data-start="773.03" data-end="779.79">So, one of the things I think is really, really important is that JavaScript is open to all.</span> <span data-start="779.79" data-end="784.31">One of the language's most most compelling features is its openness.</span> <span data-start="784.31" data-end="789.63">Even before we write our first function, many of us were looking into other people's website</span> <span data-start="789.63" data-end="793.951">and viewing the source and trying to figure out, "How did they do that?</span> <span data-start="793.951" data-end="797.33">What did they write that made a particular thing happen?"</span> <span data-start="797.33" data-end="801.69">We might not understand how code actually works, we might not understand who makes it</span> <span data-start="801.69" data-end="808.43">useful or who wrote it, but it is the simple act of opening the control panel and viewing</span> <span data-start="808.43" data-end="814.06">this source, and being curious is instrumental because we're we might not consider ourselves</span> <span data-start="814.06" data-end="820.59">developers at this point, but it is this curiosity and in desire to understand JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="820.59" data-end="825.91">the desire to understand what is going on under the hood which actually grants us membership</span> <span data-start="825.91" data-end="828.01">to the community.</span> </p>
