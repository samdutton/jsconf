<p><span data-start="0.16" data-end="1.16">Donde Esta La BiblioTech?</span> <span data-start="1.16" data-end="2.16">Patricia Realini KATIE: Hello. Welcome back. So, this is the</span> <span data-start="2.16" data-end="3.16">last talk before we all get to take a break and get a snack. Try to, like, resist the</span> <span data-start="3.16" data-end="4.16">urge to just go off to the pool and not come back because if you do it then I'll do it.</span> <span data-start="4.16" data-end="5.16">And then who is gonna introduce the speakers if I'm not here? No. So, our next speaker</span> <span data-start="5.16" data-end="7.315">is Patricia Ruiz\h oh, gosh. My brain. I'm sorry. I just. Patricia Ruiz Realini. I got</span> <span data-start="7.315" data-end="8.89">that right, right? Yes. Okay. Cool. And Patricia, when I asked her about her fun fact in had</span> <span data-start="8.89" data-end="9.89">her first job for three years, she was a taekwondo instructor. And if you have a problem with</span> <span data-start="9.89" data-end="10.89">the bathroom policy, talk to her, not Brian. She'll set you straight. No, I'm sorry. She's</span> <span data-start="10.89" data-end="12.47">a lovely person and you're going to enjoy her talk. Everyone, give it up for Patricia.</span> <span data-start="12.47" data-end="13.47">[ Applause ] PATRICIA: Hi, everybody. I'm so excited to</span> <span data-start="13.47" data-end="14.47">be here. Thank you so much for coming to see my talk. I hope you're having a great first</span> <span data-start="14.47" data-end="17.76">day. I would like to begin by acknowledging that we're on occupied lands and offer respect</span> <span data-start="17.76" data-end="22.92">towards the people past and present. And I would also like to thank the organizers for</span> <span data-start="22.92" data-end="28.33">another year of JSConf US. It's already starting to be\h it's already\h it's off to a really</span> <span data-start="28.33" data-end="31.939">great start and I'm so grateful to be here. I have been wanting to give this talk for</span> <span data-start="31.939" data-end="38">a very long time. I used to live on the same block as the public library in my neighborhood</span> <span data-start="38" data-end="44.94">and I would go constantly to pick up books that I placed on hold. To co work in the summers</span> <span data-start="44.94" data-end="50.199">because I didn't have AC and to print out concert tickets because I didn't to want spend</span> <span data-start="50.199" data-end="57.39">my money on a printer and printer ink. And I got the experience of using the Internet</span> <span data-start="57.39" data-end="61.8">from the library and it made me curious about what it is like to depend on libraries around</span> <span data-start="61.8" data-end="66.75">the country for Internet access. Since then, I have made efforts to stop into public libraries</span> <span data-start="66.75" data-end="75.44">it compare the experiences. That was the impetus for this talk. If you walk past the computer</span> <span data-start="75.44" data-end="82.33">bay in a library, it becomes evident that when you don't own a device, personal computer</span> <span data-start="82.33" data-end="90.26">or have a personal broadband connection goes far beyond the physical limitations. 30% of</span> <span data-start="90.26" data-end="95.86">the rural US is closer to dial up speeds than broadband speeds. And urban broadband users</span> <span data-start="95.86" data-end="104.32">are on 3.1 megabytes per second. You recall users are lucky to achieve 500 kilobytes a</span> <span data-start="104.32" data-end="113.7">second. 162.8 million people do not use the Internet at broadband speeds. While the FCC</span> <span data-start="113.7" data-end="119.46">previously reported that broadband is not available to 24.7 million Americans, that</span> <span data-start="119.46" data-end="127.24">is stark in rural areas. For example, Microsoft found in Ferry County, Washington, they estimated</span> <span data-start="127.24" data-end="133.28">only 2% of people use broadband service versus the 100% that the federal government is said</span> <span data-start="133.28" data-end="139.7">so far access in that area. While many might focus on just the rural access, city broadband</span> <span data-start="139.7" data-end="144.42">access is also just as relevant. The University of Illinois of Chicago's digital excellence</span> <span data-start="144.42" data-end="150.26">in Chicago report found that 40% of Chicago residents, especially Latinx population, have</span> <span data-start="150.26" data-end="157.2">limited or in access to the Internet. Of that 40%, 35% have to use Wi Fi in public places</span> <span data-start="157.2" data-end="162.81">to get access. 25% of all Chicagoans do not use the Internet. Of those, people do not</span> <span data-start="162.81" data-end="167.73">use the Internet at all, while 15% only have limited access. And here on the map, we can</span> <span data-start="167.73" data-end="174.04">see those discrepancies based on geography and how that specifically happens in low income</span> <span data-start="174.04" data-end="178.74">areas. On the left you can see the percentage who have Internet access at home, and on the</span> <span data-start="178.74" data-end="183.76">right you can see the percentage who do not have Internet access at home because of difficulty</span> <span data-start="183.76" data-end="189.29">of availability. This has a real effect on people's livelihoods. The US bureau of labor</span> <span data-start="189.29" data-end="193.91">statistics employment data shows that the highest unemployment rates are frequently</span> <span data-start="193.91" data-end="203.51">located in the counties with the lowest availability of broadband. This is why the 16,700 public</span> <span data-start="203.51" data-end="208.96">library locations nationwide are so vital to the Internet. And on their own, are an</span> <span data-start="208.96" data-end="213.6">incredible source of information about our users. The Institute of museums and library</span> <span data-start="213.6" data-end="221.07">services 2019 report on the 2016 fiscal year found that for every 5,000 people libraries\h</span> <span data-start="221.07" data-end="228.85">for every 5,000 people libraries serving a small population size offer 23.68 computers</span> <span data-start="228.85" data-end="236.79">versus\h while only 4.04 library computers are available in libraries that serve large</span> <span data-start="236.79" data-end="244.65">populations. For example, 70% of Idaho's 103 libraries are the only source of free Internet</span> <span data-start="244.65" data-end="249.25">in Idaho's rural and remote communities. After significant investment from the broadband</span> <span data-start="249.25" data-end="254.55">technology opportunities program, the mean connection speed in Idaho libraries is still</span> <span data-start="254.55" data-end="262.82">only 12.8 megabytes per second. A steep drop from the national average of 57.4. The report</span> <span data-start="262.82" data-end="272.66">looked at the discrepancies in availability. And it does vary across states. Seven states</span> <span data-start="272.66" data-end="278.91">including Hawaii had fewer than four computers per 5,000 people. While two states, including</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.91" data-end="286.82">Vermont and Nebraska had more than nine. Most states had between 10 and 20 public access</span> <span data-start="286.82" data-end="294.52">Internet computers per a stationary outlet. DC having the most at 38.46. Libraries are</span> <span data-start="294.52" data-end="299.44">highly popular amongst adolescent and teenagers who want to spend time with other people their</span> <span data-start="299.44" data-end="304.441">age because they're open, accessible, free, and librarians make them feel welcome. In</span> <span data-start="304.441" data-end="308.93">many branches, they even assign areas for teenagers to be with one another. Compared</span> <span data-start="308.93" data-end="313.02">to the social space of the library with the social spaces of commercial establishments</span> <span data-start="313.02" data-end="317.49">like Starbucks or McDonald's, not everyone can afford to frequent them, and not all paying</span> <span data-start="317.49" data-end="323.55">customers are welcome to stay for long. Black and brown people, poor and homeless people</span> <span data-start="323.55" data-end="329.9">don't consider entering these spaces. They know standing outside a high end eatery can</span> <span data-start="329.9" data-end="337.36">make managers call the police. And I have been in restaurant using Wi Fi and ask police</span> <span data-start="337.36" data-end="345.15">ask a person who was coming from jail and was a homeless person, I watched them ask</span> <span data-start="345.15" data-end="349.14">this person to leave and say they were not welcome at the establishment because they</span> <span data-start="349.14" data-end="354.98">did not fit in. This is really limiting so much access for people that desperately need</span> <span data-start="354.98" data-end="363.08">it. So, where do they go? They go to the BiblioTech, of course. And not just during opening hours.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="363.08" data-end="370.99">The 2016 usage and engagement report found that 7% of Americans age 60 and overuse the</span> <span data-start="370.99" data-end="377.21">library Wi Fi signal outside when libraries are closed. A lot of the main reasons for</span> <span data-start="377.21" data-end="382.58">Internet usage in public library are similar to a lot of our own basic Internet needs.</span> <span data-start="382.58" data-end="388.58">Checking email, doing research in many cases on personal health and outside of these uses,</span> <span data-start="388.58" data-end="394.4">the most different are taking classes and getting certifications. For example, getting</span> <span data-start="394.4" data-end="399.18">a food handling license to work in a restaurant is a process that takes about three hours</span> <span data-start="399.18" data-end="405.95">online and is one of the most common certifications out there for people in low income positions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="405.95" data-end="411.52">Historically, this disproportionately affects black, Latinx, homeless and immigrants the</span> <span data-start="411.52" data-end="420.05">most. With 58% of new American arrivals using the library Internet on a rate of once a week.</span> <span data-start="420.05" data-end="425.58">Kids under the age of 16 and also highly effective. Seven of ten teachers now require homework</span> <span data-start="425.58" data-end="435.23">with Internet access. Yet a third of kindergartners and others are unable to go online from home.</span> <span data-start="435.23" data-end="443.38">Some in Coachella and Huntsville, Alabama, require buses that have Wi Fi. They are sometimes</span> <span data-start="443.38" data-end="451.6">parked overnight and can connect and continue studying. In Detroit and New Orleans, as many</span> <span data-start="451.6" data-end="456.711">as one third of homes do not have broadband, children crowd libraries and other areas to</span> <span data-start="456.711" data-end="463.93">use free hot spots. Broadband limitations don't just change when and where you use the</span> <span data-start="463.93" data-end="469.12">Internet, but how. Google's 2011 state of interactivity report shows the difference</span> <span data-start="469.12" data-end="475.32">in usage based on broadband speeds. Here we can see people with limited access tend to</span> <span data-start="475.32" data-end="481.6">download and rely on offline more than the cloud because they have higher access to broadband</span> <span data-start="481.6" data-end="489.811">speeds. Specific to the library experience, there are a few standout considerations. Time</span> <span data-start="489.811" data-end="495.38">outs are frequently out of the control of librarians on PC reservation software and</span> <span data-start="495.38" data-end="500.199">it is a huge barrier for systemically oppressed people. Because when your identity contingencies</span> <span data-start="500.199" data-end="505.23">generate social pressure, and the result of this being stereo type threat, it means people</span> <span data-start="505.23" data-end="510.46">are less likely to speak up and ask for help when they need a longer session on the computer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="510.46" data-end="515.029">And in most cases, there are many library locations where the librarians are not familiar</span> <span data-start="515.029" data-end="521.879">with how to make the changes or have the administrative access to do so. When I visited the San Francisco</span> <span data-start="521.879" data-end="530.899">public library, with a 25 guest pass I had 15 minutes. With 5 minutes to start up the</span> <span data-start="530.899" data-end="536.68">reservation system. And the last 5 minutes, bombarded that it will end soon. Imagine trying</span> <span data-start="536.68" data-end="543.3">to take a three hour certification course that cannot be returned to under those conditions.</span> <span data-start="543.3" data-end="551.019">The Chicago public library requires people to show through ID that they are not Chicagoans</span> <span data-start="551.019" data-end="560.509">to access guest pass. Some charge due to low budgets and limited numbers of biases. And</span> <span data-start="560.509" data-end="567.579">you can see the biased co worker below, people like this are highly likely to accelerate</span> <span data-start="567.579" data-end="573.029">charges on overdue materials and limit and bar people from Internet action access and</span> <span data-start="573.029" data-end="579.67">the library. On the technical side, Windows 10 is the most prevalent operating system.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="579.67" data-end="586.11">While just in 2018, just last year, many librarians reported they're still in the process of moving</span> <span data-start="586.11" data-end="590.16">from Windows 8 to Windows 10. Sorry. That's a little\h I can't see the rest of my speaker</span> <span data-start="590.16" data-end="594.01">notes. I'm trying\h so, there's also a lot of device and Wi Fi hot spot lending that</span> <span data-start="594.01" data-end="600.22">libraries do, but most of the time this is at a fee. They usually charge about $5 to</span> <span data-start="600.22" data-end="604.559">check out a Wi Fi hot spot and take it home. And in some cases, if they're lucky, they</span> <span data-start="604.559" data-end="610.569">have access to remote device management software that allows them to turn these devices off</span> <span data-start="610.569" data-end="616.019">if they're overdue. But the charges can be up to $150 for not returning a Wi Fi hot spot</span> <span data-start="616.019" data-end="624.739">to the library. With these charges, with device remote management software that librarians</span> <span data-start="624.739" data-end="629.709">use to throttle data so they don't have to pay high charges, we see that a lot of libraries</span> <span data-start="629.709" data-end="634.81">have difficulty offering these services without grants and subsidies that are highly needed</span> <span data-start="634.81" data-end="642.23">in their communities. Being barred usage of the Internet in libraries is much more common</span> <span data-start="642.23" data-end="649.1">than you think. In Seattle, patrons who $20 are blocked from borrowing, and $25, they</span> <span data-start="649.1" data-end="654.91">are sent to collection agencies. Even in prosperous Seattle, 20% of accounts are blocked due to</span> <span data-start="654.91" data-end="663.189">debt. This should be changing soon as Seattle just had a vote in August 6th of this year</span> <span data-start="663.189" data-end="669.42">where they passed prop 1 which is going to eliminate the fine system at the Seattle public</span> <span data-start="669.42" data-end="674.959">library which is fantastic news. But\h and we see that this is also happening in DC,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="674.959" data-end="681.259">Salt Lake and Baltimore. The San Francisco public library has 5% of accounts blocked</span> <span data-start="681.259" data-end="686.66">due to overdue fines, but in low income areas, the rate is as high as 11% and they are currently</span> <span data-start="686.66" data-end="692.86">also going through a proposal to go fine free as well. And this is important to know because</span> <span data-start="692.86" data-end="697.76">fines aren't even a significant revenue for any libraries. Salt Lake went fine free in</span> <span data-start="697.76" data-end="704.269">2017 after finding that late fees accounted for just .3% of the city library's total revenue.</span> <span data-start="704.269" data-end="709.61">Research shows overdue fines do not ensure materials end up back on the shelves. And</span> <span data-start="709.61" data-end="714.869">fine free have not seen an increase in late returns. One library saw the late return rate</span> <span data-start="714.869" data-end="722.529">drop from 9% to 4% following fine elimination. Some of the most pressing needs when it comes</span> <span data-start="722.529" data-end="729.97">to Internet access in libraries are PC reservation compatible access, accessibility shortcuts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="729.97" data-end="736.069">Most notably access to changing signs of text on the screens. Because some PC reservation</span> <span data-start="736.069" data-end="743.179">software obfuscate access to any kind of visual controls. Also, the text to speech access</span> <span data-start="743.179" data-end="755.06">and just most of the accessibility shortcuts on our computers is obfuscated by the software.</span> <span data-start="755.06" data-end="762.47">And they're often limited to select locations, making access even harder. And with low broadband</span> <span data-start="762.47" data-end="767.76">speeds, performance is also a super paramount issues as well as authentication and anti</span> <span data-start="767.76" data-end="774.1">surveillance measures that we'll get a little bit deeper into. the Google need for speed</span> <span data-start="774.1" data-end="781.689">report found that 53% of website visitors leave with f a website doesn't load in 3 seconds.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="781.689" data-end="789.079">The average load is 9 seconds on a 3G connection. That's as long as it takes to sing the alphabet</span> <span data-start="789.079" data-end="795.529">song. And 14 seconds on a 4G connection. When surveyed, they found one out of two expect</span> <span data-start="795.529" data-end="806.73">it to load in less than 2 seconds. And faster sites had session lengths 70% longer and bounce</span> <span data-start="806.73" data-end="813.309">rates that were 35% lore. 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site that they</span> <span data-start="813.309" data-end="820.029">had trouble accessing and 40% will visit a competitor's website instead. Mobile sites</span> <span data-start="820.029" data-end="827.059">that loaded in 5 seconds earned almost double the revenue websites that took 19 seconds.</span> <span data-start="827.059" data-end="836.319">And you can boost conversion by 27%. Part of the problem is ads on mobile. Mobile ads</span> <span data-start="836.319" data-end="842.699">take an average of 5 seconds to load. About double the time as it takes for desktop ads</span> <span data-start="842.699" data-end="846.809">to load according to the media ratings council. Sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="846.809" data-end="852.209">Email and online\h and then another issue past performance is authentication. Recently</span> <span data-start="852.209" data-end="856.579">there was this Twitter thread a few months ago which made me sad that it happened after</span> <span data-start="856.579" data-end="861.329">my talk and not before. Because I was excited to tell you about this. But email and online</span> <span data-start="861.329" data-end="868.309">messages SMS services like WhatsApp are truly the modern catch 22. You need an email to</span> <span data-start="868.309" data-end="873.859">get a phone number. And you need a phone number to get an email. So, especially for people</span> <span data-start="873.859" data-end="882.359">struggling with homelessness, this is a huge barrier for them to escape this oppression.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="882.359" data-end="886.37">And I personally think that this problem is ripe for password managers to find a solution</span> <span data-start="886.37" data-end="893.009">to. I would love to see authentication stations in libraries utilizing authenticator app technology</span> <span data-start="893.009" data-end="903.41">and having access base on a librarian's approval. For users that are not web literate, dealing</span> <span data-start="903.41" data-end="910.559">with sensitive materials like paying bills and sharing photos. An example of handling</span> <span data-start="910.559" data-end="915.529">this is making sure that we detect in f a device is a new device and it's the first</span> <span data-start="915.529" data-end="922.399">time logging on. We can offer alerts and messaging like GDRP and communicating with them and</span> <span data-start="922.399" data-end="934.569">what to do before working on computers that may be insecure. Another security factor is</span> <span data-start="934.569" data-end="939.899">surveillance. Facial recognition software is creeping into libraries starting in academic</span> <span data-start="939.899" data-end="946.839">libraries today. The most prevalent threat, however, to intellectual freedom is section</span> <span data-start="946.839" data-end="954.931">215 of the patriot act. The government can demand the library records with a secret can</span> <span data-start="954.931" data-end="962.579">court order and without probable cause. They can block the librarians from revealing the</span> <span data-start="962.579" data-end="970.72">request, and it\hdoesn't only cover the books, but Internet check ins, and hard drives from</span> <span data-start="970.72" data-end="980.089">library computers. Libraries took action to protect patrons. Posting these within view</span> <span data-start="980.089" data-end="985.939">of computer stations. In fall of 2002, the library research center at the University</span> <span data-start="985.939" data-end="993.379">of Illinois surveyed 1500 libraries and found that of the 444 libraries that had been subject</span> <span data-start="993.379" data-end="999.779">to law enforcement requests for information about patrons, 225 had not cooperated but</span> <span data-start="999.779" data-end="1006.089">219 had. Librarians in Santa Cruz demonstrated their opposition by taking drastic measures</span> <span data-start="1006.089" data-end="1013.829">and shredding all historical information including computer usage or a daily basis. In 2005,</span> <span data-start="1013.829" data-end="1020.389">four Connecticut librarians going under the modicum of John Doe with the help of the ACLU</span> <span data-start="1020.389" data-end="1025.94">sued the US attorney general to lift the gag order that the librarians were subject to</span> <span data-start="1025.94" data-end="1034.2">produce records. By 2006, the FBI dropped the defense of the gag division. It was expired</span> <span data-start="1034.2" data-end="1041.52">in May of 2015, but the US freedom act, the expired parts of the law with the exception</span> <span data-start="1041.52" data-end="1049.16">of the gag order were reported broadly as restored and renewed and come up for expiration</span> <span data-start="1049.16" data-end="1056.38">this year in December. But there's a lot of success stories too. Libraries are still the</span> <span data-start="1056.38" data-end="1060.82">most helpful resource for learning about the Internet and web literacy classes are the</span> <span data-start="1060.82" data-end="1066.64">most highly requested programming at libraries. Because library staff need to be totally up</span> <span data-start="1066.64" data-end="1070.89">to date on their digital skills, they learn these things just in time and turn around</span> <span data-start="1070.89" data-end="1080.01">and immediately start teaching them to patrons. My favorite resource are the zines by read</span> <span data-start="1080.01" data-end="1086.681">me and they host crypto parties. And there are libraries offering some of the most high</span> <span data-start="1086.681" data-end="1094.11">tech access rout there. The Los Angeles library has the Octavia Butler space. It's at the</span> <span data-start="1094.11" data-end="1101.32">location that's great for families to toy around with 3D printing and all kinds of other</span> <span data-start="1101.32" data-end="1111.42">high tech gadgets. And the Austin public library, the laptop stations with computer users and</span> <span data-start="1111.42" data-end="1117.07">up to date technology. All you have to do is scan your library card and unlock one of</span> <span data-start="1117.07" data-end="1123.26">these laptops much like you would unlock a bicycle out in a rideshare program and you</span> <span data-start="1123.26" data-end="1131.73">can use the laptop anywhere you want in the library. The biggest tax credits, grants and</span> <span data-start="1131.73" data-end="1137.76">subsidies only go so far\hto support public library Internet access. All the most robust</span> <span data-start="1137.76" data-end="1144.54">results are the public private partnerships. We as a community should be doing everything</span> <span data-start="1144.54" data-end="1150.27">we can to encourage the companies we work for to get involved and help build partnerships</span> <span data-start="1150.27" data-end="1155.86">to get better hardware, software and help. Overreliance on the federal broadband stimulus</span> <span data-start="1155.86" data-end="1161.13">program has tied censorship to funding and the future has the potential to be bleak as</span> <span data-start="1161.13" data-end="1168.73">we have seen how the patriot act affected usage of the Internet in the libraries. And</span> <span data-start="1168.73" data-end="1178.17">there was the initiative that has harnessed the unused channels known as white space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1178.17" data-end="1189.38">It's unused spectrum below 700 megahertz. Using UHF signals. This is sometimes called</span> <span data-start="1189.38" data-end="1196.2">super Wi Fi. It behaves like regular Wi Fi but uses lower channels to cover greater distances</span> <span data-start="1196.2" data-end="1206.74">than Wi Fi hot spots. It's less populated in remote regions. And imagine the capacity</span> <span data-start="1206.74" data-end="1212.63">for urban areas where people don't have personal access at home. Where their kids need to stay</span> <span data-start="1212.63" data-end="1217.75">on buses to be able to use Wi Fi to finish their homework. If your company can't get</span> <span data-start="1217.75" data-end="1227.53">involved, volunteer for a crypto\hat your library. Organize your next meetup at a library</span> <span data-start="1227.53" data-end="1236.67">computer lab to give more access to people outside of your\hown personal circle. So,</span> <span data-start="1236.67" data-end="1240.7">thank you so much for coming and hearing about what it's like to use the Internet at the</span> <span data-start="1240.7" data-end="1245.92">library. I hope next time you stop by a library and check out what it's like to use their</span> <span data-start="1245.92" data-end="1247.933">computers and not just your fancy Macbooks. Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1247.933" data-end="1248.933">[ Applause ] KATIE: All right. Thank you so much, Patricia.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1248.933" data-end="1249.933">And how freakin' awesome is the themed slide presentation. Yes. So cool. It matches my</span> <span data-start="1249.933" data-end="1250.933">new scrunchie. All right. So, it is time for a snack break. So, we will be back here in</span> <span data-start="1250.933" data-end="1251.933">this room or the other room\h what time again? At 4:15. So, we have quite a bit of time to</span> </p>
