<p><span data-start="113.649" data-end="117.38">But, all my demo's were still in mobile phone.</span> <span data-start="117.38" data-end="121">I had to disect it.</span> <span data-start="121" data-end="122.85">The result is wonderful.</span> <span data-start="122.85" data-end="131.36">A lesson learned is, if I can do this without owning a screwdriver, you can build cool stuff</span> <span data-start="131.36" data-end="135.7">with things you learn in the presentation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.7" data-end="141.29">My timer is not running.</span> <span data-start="141.29" data-end="145.599">The maker movement is at the moment everywhere.</span> <span data-start="145.599" data-end="146.599">I was an Malaysia.</span> <span data-start="146.599" data-end="157.489">A guy came up to me, we have a maker place, come down and fiddle with us.</span> <span data-start="157.489" data-end="163.19">We build stuff.</span> <span data-start="163.19" data-end="170.12">And the reason we can do it, these new little development boards, for example what we saw</span> <span data-start="170.12" data-end="171.659">in the disco.</span> <span data-start="171.659" data-end="173.73">They are here, cheap.</span> <span data-start="173.73" data-end="174.73">Microcontrollers.</span> <span data-start="174.73" data-end="176.299">Computers have become so fast.</span> <span data-start="176.299" data-end="180.81">They can be tiny and do cool stuff.</span> <span data-start="180.81" data-end="185.95">The second thing is, that you can attach phone sensors to this.</span> <span data-start="185.95" data-end="194.459">The whole explosion of smartphones makes that having sensors that control your gravity or</span> <span data-start="194.459" data-end="198.2">small camera's, have become very very cheap.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="261.67" data-end="264.401">And it is cheaper.</span> <span data-start="264.401" data-end="266.83">It runs Firefox OS.</span> <span data-start="266.83" data-end="269.06">Why is that cool?</span> <span data-start="269.06" data-end="270.42">It works like this.</span> <span data-start="270.42" data-end="271.83">I have a phone.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="358.84" data-end="359.84">Don't need the screen.</span> <span data-start="359.84" data-end="360.84">Disconnect it.</span> <span data-start="360.84" data-end="365.71">The camera is easily detached.</span> <span data-start="365.71" data-end="370.84">Because it fell out.</span> <span data-start="370.84" data-end="373.22">But then, I found something wonderful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.22" data-end="378.31">This camera's have a standard connector zozer You can go to China and buy a better camera</span> <span data-start="378.31" data-end="381.31">for the phone.</span> <span data-start="381.31" data-end="382.82">It doesn't fit in the printboard.</span> <span data-start="382.82" data-end="390.19">We are not needing it to fit in a phone, we can buy a new camera and attach that.</span> <span data-start="390.19" data-end="391.55">Blew my mind.</span> <span data-start="391.55" data-end="392.55">Yes.</span> <span data-start="392.55" data-end="398.16">Then there is at the bottom something.</span> <span data-start="398.16" data-end="399.76">This is connected to the screen.</span> <span data-start="399.76" data-end="401.12">I don't know what it is.</span> <span data-start="401.12" data-end="403.98">I ripped it apart and it still worked.</span> <span data-start="403.98" data-end="405.49">So..</span> <span data-start="405.49" data-end="409.31">Basically, you end up with this.</span> <span data-start="409.31" data-end="410.74">A print board.</span> <span data-start="410.74" data-end="417.37">The thing at the left is it does radio communication.</span> <span data-start="417.37" data-end="420.41">An antenna extension you plug in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.41" data-end="427.75">If you want to do something with data over 3g, or phone calls.</span> <span data-start="427.75" data-end="429.27">And you'll end up with the casing.</span> <span data-start="429.27" data-end="434.72">It has a touchscreen and normal screen.</span> <span data-start="434.72" data-end="437.22">I want those to separate as well.</span> <span data-start="437.22" data-end="440.99">The thing is, at cheap smartphones they are glued together.</span> <span data-start="440.99" data-end="444.82">I tried a screwdriver to unblue these.</span> <span data-start="444.82" data-end="450.83">It broke and cracked.</span> <span data-start="450.83" data-end="453.6">I can only detach the touchscreen.</span> <span data-start="453.6" data-end="457.58">This is the touchscreen connecter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.58" data-end="462.9">That didn't work out that well either.</span> <span data-start="462.9" data-end="467.25">So the demo's today don't involve a screen.</span> <span data-start="467.25" data-end="472.3">So, then we got this board.</span> <span data-start="472.3" data-end="474.72">Wifi doesn't work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="474.72" data-end="476.37">And that really puzzled me.</span> <span data-start="476.37" data-end="481.29">I figured, the radiochip has something to do with this.</span> <span data-start="481.29" data-end="485.1">I saw the connectors at the backcover of the phone.</span> <span data-start="485.1" data-end="488.68">They look like paper with a copperplating.</span> <span data-start="488.68" data-end="490.26">This little thing.</span> <span data-start="490.26" data-end="494.14">If you attach it with tape to your phone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.14" data-end="498.43">You'll go from zero to 12.</span> <span data-start="498.43" data-end="500.83">I am still puzzled how it works.</span> <span data-start="500.83" data-end="503.42">I'm a software guy.</span> <span data-start="503.42" data-end="505.09">This is real tape.</span> <span data-start="505.09" data-end="508.21">For your hardware solutions.</span> <span data-start="508.21" data-end="510.71">It is small.</span> <span data-start="510.71" data-end="513.56">3/4 of a creditcard.</span> <span data-start="513.56" data-end="514.969">In all fairness.</span> <span data-start="514.969" data-end="518.7">I first put the creditcard next to the thing.</span> <span data-start="518.7" data-end="524.2">And only 5 minutes for the talk I remembered, you could see my creditcard number.</span> <span data-start="524.2" data-end="533">So what we have is the little board.</span> <span data-start="533" data-end="534.2">Gecko running on top.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="534.2" data-end="535.85">And we can build something cool.</span> <span data-start="535.85" data-end="539.93">I don't have a problem with anything.</span> <span data-start="539.93" data-end="540.93">Jan OS.</span> <span data-start="540.93" data-end="550.23">The  unofficial logo.</span> <span data-start="550.23" data-end="561.56">JanOs is an alternative to firefox Os.</span> <span data-start="561.56" data-end="565.3">You can run it at any rooted Firefox Os phone.</span> <span data-start="565.3" data-end="569.07">It is made to run on the board.</span> <span data-start="569.07" data-end="572.12">There is nothing.</span> <span data-start="572.12" data-end="574.67">It gives you a Javascript console.</span> <span data-start="574.67" data-end="582.8">If you  put a sim card in.</span> <span data-start="582.8" data-end="586.75">And, I made another mistake.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="586.75" data-end="598.23">I broke the casing of my phone while I was trying to fiddle with it.</span> <span data-start="598.23" data-end="599.71">With one hand do this.</span> <span data-start="599.71" data-end="601.86">Go to my computer.</span> <span data-start="601.86" data-end="605.44">Type the flash command.</span> <span data-start="605.44" data-end="609.46">So, please keep your backcover intact.</span> <span data-start="609.46" data-end="613.92">Because everything fits together and makes it a lot easier to flash.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="613.92" data-end="616.89">JanOs is easy.</span> <span data-start="616.89" data-end="621.22">It is an Html file.</span> <span data-start="621.22" data-end="623.02">We just render 1 Html file.</span> <span data-start="623.02" data-end="624.34">And it has Javascript.</span> <span data-start="624.34" data-end="630.56">You can device stuff with it.</span> <span data-start="630.56" data-end="635.39">You can also connect the firefox developer tools to this phone.</span> <span data-start="635.39" data-end="640.94">So, if you want a Javascript debugger, use the normal Firefox debugger.</span> <span data-start="640.94" data-end="642.14">It is powerful.</span> <span data-start="642.14" data-end="645.56">I'll show you in a second.</span> <span data-start="645.56" data-end="650.19">There is a bunch of things you can do.</span> <span data-start="650.19" data-end="652.5">Make a security camera.</span> <span data-start="652.5" data-end="654.74">Take a photo every 5 seconds.</span> <span data-start="654.74" data-end="657.59">See if something changed.</span> <span data-start="657.59" data-end="658.7">If so, make a photo.</span> <span data-start="658.7" data-end="662.47">Send it to me over Mms or email.</span> <span data-start="662.47" data-end="665.71">Maybe if something is going on, you can call.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="665.71" data-end="668.34">You can put a sim card in.</span> <span data-start="668.34" data-end="675.83">Plus, my little printboard has 4Gb of storage.</span> <span data-start="675.83" data-end="679.33">So, if you want to do that, 7 lines of code.</span> <span data-start="679.33" data-end="683.1">You say, camera takepicture.</span> <span data-start="683.1" data-end="684.1">It resolves.</span> <span data-start="684.1" data-end="687.27">You get a blob.</span> <span data-start="687.27" data-end="691.98">Can be on the Sd card or what you have.</span> <span data-start="691.98" data-end="693.91">And say storage addnamed.</span> <span data-start="693.91" data-end="695.13">Easy.</span> <span data-start="695.13" data-end="698.87">Another one, a doorbell.</span> </p>
