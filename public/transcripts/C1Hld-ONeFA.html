<p><span data-start="792.84" data-end="795.93">API so what feathers does it's kind of</span> <span data-start="795.93" data-end="797.82">like a small library on top of Express</span> <span data-start="797.82" data-end="801.66">that lets you create and consume rests</span> <span data-start="801.66" data-end="804.57">and real-time API and that's it so you</span> <span data-start="804.57"

data-end="810.33">technology one it's just this connector</span> <span data-start="810.33" data-end="811.95">in between and what this basically does</span> <span data-start="811.95" data-end="815.64">in this case is gives us a database</span> <span data-start="815.64" data-end="818.28">connection just to store stuff it's</span> <span data-start="818.28" data-end="821.22">using

<span data-start="830.58" data-end="834.03">just a file based database and and then</span> <span data-start="834.03" data-end="835.56">it also provides the connection because</span> <span data-start="835.56" data-end="837.9">it also works in the Kline between the</span> <span data-start="837.9" data-end="840.39">front-end app and the backend and then</span> <span data-start="840.39"

data-start="858.61" data-end="860.92">someone always changed so there's a</span> <span data-start="860.92" data-end="863.95">couple things to it the first one and I</span> <span data-start="863.95" data-end="865.21">don't even think I have to blow that up</span> <span data-start="865.21" data-end="867.85">because this queen is huge maybe a</span> <span data-start="867.85" data-end="869.47">little bit</span> <span data-start="869.47" data-end="874.93">the first one is actions an action is</span> <span data-start="874.93" data-end="876.61">basically something that you want it to</span> <span data-start="876.61" data-end="889.09">do if you haven't met a sentence try and</span> <span data-start="889.09" data-end="891.46">pull out something that's similar so in</span>

data-end="927.16">then we have something here reply with a</span> <span data-start="927.16" data-end="931.36">couple of things and this is the search</span> <span data-start="931.36" data-end="935.43">of course this has been done by people</span> <span data-start="935.43" data-end="937.84">way smarter than me already and there's</span> <span data-start="937.84" data-end="940.45">an API for it and a really cool one</span> <span data-start="940.45" data-end="943.12">actually that I hope I have some time to</span> <span data-start="943.12" data-end="945.67">show a little bit so this is actions</span> <span data-start="945.67" data-end="948.76">there's only 11 of them and then the</span> <span data-start="948.76" data-end="953.15">next part of the thing we have is</span> <span data-start="953.16" data-end="957.13">trainings so you know people always</span> <span data-start="957.13" data-end="965.78">think that millions and millions</span> <span data-start="965.79" data-end="970.01">well it's somewhat accurate</span> <span data-start="970.01" data-end="975.99">so this basically maps text to an action</span> <span

we</span> <span data-start="1014.48" data-end="1017.209">have actions and trainings the last part</span> <span data-start="1017.209" data-end="1020.779">of the API actually is the interesting</span>
