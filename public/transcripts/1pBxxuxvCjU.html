data-end="1381.07">difficult to come up with content month</span> <span data-start="1381.07" data-end="1383.47">after month after month and that's not</span> <span data-start="1383.47" data-end="1385.21">to say that we hadn't accomplished</span> <span data-start="1385.21" data-end="1387.07">anything that month but you know we're</span> <span data-start="1387.07" data-end="1388.96">busy people we have lives outside of</span> <span data-start="1388.96" data-end="1391.36">this text stuff and we want to be able</span> <span data-start="1391.36" data-end="1395.23">to participate in them so we started</span> <span data-start="1395.23" data-end="1397.69">doing these geek dinners and it was</span> <span data-start="1397.69" data-end="1399.21">fantastic for a little while because</span> <span data-start="1399.21" data-end="1401.47">everybody was like hey let's go to this</span> <span data-start="1401.47" data-end="1403.09">brewery and we'll eat some good food and</span> <span data-start="1403.09" data-end="1404.53">drink some good beer and it'll be like</span> <span data-start="1404.53" data-end="1407.02">great it'll be awesome and then like</span> <span data-start="1407.02" data-end="1408.49">after a few months of that we kind of</span> <span data-start="1408.49" data-end="1411.04">got in a rut and realized that it wasn't</span> <span data-start="1411.04" data-end="1413.71">working so don't do that maybe like once</span> <span data-start="1413.71" data-end="1416.89">a year twice at max but I would schedule</span> <span data-start="1416.89" data-end="1419.05">it separately from the traditional</span> <span data-start="1419.05" data-end="1421.63">meetup format because people don't want</span> <span data-start="1421.63" data-end="1423.16">to go to a meetup to just like go to</span> <span data-start="1423.16" data-end="1424.75">dinner with a bunch of people like it's</span> <span data-start="1424.75" data-end="1426.25">cool to talk shop every once in a while</span> <span data-start="1426.25" data-end="1430.48">but people really crave new things at</span> <span data-start="1430.48" data-end="1433.24">amita people really crave ideas and when</span> <span data-start="1433.24" data-end="1435.16">you're talking about technology in</span> <span data-start="1435.16" data-end="1438.25">specific ways those ideas tend to flow</span> <span data-start="1438.25" data-end="1442.06">so I think our last geek dinner was like</span> <span data-start="1442.06" data-end="1444.85">three people showed up it was abysmal it</span> <span data-start="1444.85" data-end="1446.68">was really terrible and and this was</span> <span data-start="1446.68" data-end="1449.14">after we had gone through all the effort</span> <span data-start="1449.14" data-end="1451.75">of you know combining our two meet ups</span> <span data-start="1451.75" data-end="1454.09">to to this Rockford web devs thing and</span> <span data-start="1454.09" data-end="1456.43">we were starting to reengage people and</span> <span data-start="1456.43" data-end="1457.78">it was going really well and it felt</span> <span data-start="1457.78" data-end="1460.24">like we had fallen off of a cliff excuse</span> <span data-start="1460.24" data-end="1461.77">me</span> <span data-start="1461.77" data-end="1464.62">so then we decided that we were going to</span> <span data-start="1464.62" data-end="1466.51">build something collaboratively as a</span> <span data-start="1466.51" data-end="1469.24">group we put it up on github it's at</span> <span data-start="1469.24" data-end="1472.48">github com / Rockford web / paste bin</span> <span data-start="1472.48" data-end="1476.89">too I think they wanted to name it v7</span> <span data-start="1476.89" data-end="1480.52">underscore final dash dash but you know</span> <span data-start="1480.52" data-end="1482.89">that fell through so over the course of</span> <span data-start="1482.89" data-end="1484.81">like six or seven months we</span> <span data-start="1484.81" data-end="1487.39">collaboratively built a paste bin clone</span> <span data-start="1487.39" data-end="1491.08">and we basically just went to the group</span> <span data-start="1491.08" data-end="1493.18">and every other month Michael and I</span> <span data-start="1493.18" data-end="1495.46">would switch off coding while we</span> <span data-start="1495.46" data-end="1497.2">solicited input from everybody we're</span> <span data-start="1497.2" data-end="1499.15">like so we want to build this thing what</span> <span data-start="1499.15" data-end="1501.19">would be the first step and we like went</span> <span data-start="1501.19" data-end="1502.78">through this whole creative process</span> <span data-start="1502.78" data-end="1505.51">together taking input so that everybody</span> <span data-start="1505.51" data-end="1507.52">felt like they had something to offer</span> <span data-start="1507.52" data-end="1509.95">they felt like they were engaged by this</span> <span data-start="1509.95" data-end="1512.68">process and they really contributed some</span> <span data-start="1512.68" data-end="1514.99">of them even contributed after hours and</span> <span data-start="1514.99" data-end="1517.9">like made commits to the github which</span> <span data-start="1517.9" data-end="1520.68">was great you know that's what it's for</span> <span data-start="1520.68" data-end="1523.27">so through this project we've</span> <span data-start="1523.27" data-end="1525.64">essentially tripled our engagement for</span> <span data-start="1525.64" data-end="1528.49">us that means we're up to a steady 12 to</span> <span data-start="1528.49" data-end="1532.42">15 on a good night like 20-25 but when</span> <span data-start="1532.42" data-end="1534.1">you think about that in terms of the</span> <span data-start="1534.1" data-end="1535.87">overall community size talking about a</span> <span data-start="1535.87" data-end="1538.83">pool of like 70 web technologies</span> <span data-start="1538.83" data-end="1541.72">developers you know that that is pretty</span> <span data-start="1541.72" data-end="1544.62">fantastic it has been for us anyway so</span> <span data-start="1544.62" data-end="1546.97">really don't be afraid to do something</span> <span data-start="1546.97" data-end="1551.11">different and I would say also that you</span> <span data-start="1551.11" data-end="1553.21">should use your resources at hand and by</span> <span data-start="1553.21" data-end="1555.49">this I mean human resources from the</span> <span data-start="1555.49" data-end="1557.08">most personal the ones you're in contact</span> <span data-start="1557.08" data-end="1559.3">with every day to those that are semi</span> <span data-start="1559.3" data-end="1561.94">local regional or even like if you're a</span> <span data-start="1561.94" data-end="1563.62">java or j s conf and you're like hey</span> <span data-start="1563.62" data-end="1565.69">would you maybe want to talk at my meet</span> <span data-start="1565.69" data-end="1568.21">up and somebody might say yes you know</span> <span data-start="1568.21" data-end="1570.79">you never know i would say talk to your</span> <span data-start="1570.79" data-end="1572.53">friends be like hey i know you're not</span> <span data-start="1572.53" data-end="1575.01">really into this whole development thing</span> <span data-start="1575.01" data-end="1577.57">but could you like show up because</span> <span data-start="1577.57" data-end="1579.58">having warm bodies in the room means</span> <span data-start="1579.58" data-end="1582.22">that people will perceive it as being a</span> <span data-start="1582.22" data-end="1584.08">successful thing where people share and</span> <span data-start="1584.08" data-end="1585.58">integrate and it works i mean for a</span> <span data-start="1585.58" data-end="1586.84">little bit while it really helps to</span> <span data-start="1586.84" data-end="1589.69">boost attendance and they might learn</span> <span data-start="1589.69" data-end="1592.33">something i hope they would don't be</span> <span data-start="1592.33" data-end="1593.68">afraid to talk to your co-workers and</span> <span data-start="1593.68"
