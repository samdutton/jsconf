<p><span data-start="28.67" data-end="30.77">I'm a programmer I've been programming</span> <span data-start="30.77" data-end="34.16">since I've been nine and all is great</span> <span data-start="34.16" data-end="35.899">and my kind of my focus has been data</span> <span data-start="35.899" data-end="38.12">visualization and I've been working a</span> <span data-start="38.12" data-end="39.89">little bit on my own and this year with</span> <span data-start="39.89" data-end="42.8">the guardian newspaper interactive team</span> <span data-start="42.8" data-end="44.54">where we've been working on some open</span> <span data-start="44.54" data-end="46.01">source libraries and some interactive</span> <span data-start="46.01" data-end="48.47">pieces for the Guardian and what we</span> <span data-start="48.47" data-end="50.81">realized when we started working on data</span> <span data-start="50.81" data-end="52.82">visualization open libraries is that</span> <span data-start="52.82" data-end="55.52">most of our work kind of all the snags</span> <span data-start="55.52" data-end="57.77">were hitting had to do with data and so</span> <span data-start="57.77" data-end="59.36">the first library we actually released</span> <span data-start="59.36" data-end="61.28">had to do with data management on the</span> <span data-start="61.28" data-end="63.44">client side and this talk was kind of</span> <span data-start="63.44" data-end="64.879">born I realized that what I really want</span> <span data-start="64.879" data-end="67.25">to talk about is that you can indeed do</span> <span data-start="67.25" data-end="69.079">data crunching in your browser and so on</span> <span data-start="69.079" data-end="72.35">and so really want to talk a little bit</span> <span data-start="72.35" data-end="74.329">about what is we currently do a data I</span> <span data-start="74.329" data-end="76.52">would say most of what we do has to do</span> <span data-start="76.52" data-end="78.59">with this crud space you know we create</span> <span data-start="78.59" data-end="80.9">records and we update them and we modify</span> <span data-start="80.9" data-end="83.09">them and and delete them and whatever I</span> <span data-start="83.09" data-end="85.25">did see no me toque really exciting and</span> <span data-start="85.25" data-end="87.32">that's great but there's all these other</span> <span data-start="87.32" data-end="88.7">things that we could be doing right we</span> <span data-start="88.7" data-end="90.74">could be with all this data that we're</span> <span data-start="90.74" data-end="92.479">gathering we could actually be computing</span> <span data-start="92.479" data-end="94.22">various metrics not just for our own</span> <span data-start="94.22" data-end="96.53">analytics but even for our users and</span> <span data-start="96.53" data-end="99.32">even more we can give our users filtered</span> <span data-start="99.32" data-end="100.7">views that have to do with the things</span> <span data-start="100.7" data-end="103.01">that they care about right and so the</span> <span data-start="103.01" data-end="103.88">reason I'm here is because I think</span> <span data-start="103.88" data-end="106.01">that's kind of the awesome zone where we</span> <span data-start="106.01" data-end="107.75">can combine all these practices that</span> <span data-start="107.75" data-end="109.52">we've had for many years I have to do</span> <span data-start="109.52" data-end="112.31">with crud apps but join them with some</span> <span data-start="112.31" data-end="115.76">more data heavy processing to create</span> <span data-start="115.76" data-end="118.549">this awesome square right there and so</span> <span data-start="118.549" data-end="121.58">why client-side a because their browsers</span> <span data-start="121.58" data-end="125.03">can handle it right if any of you are</span> <span data-start="125.03" data-end="127.369">done writing apps for IE which I'm sure</span> <span data-start="127.369" data-end="130.039">all of you are deep down inside then you</span> <span data-start="130.039" data-end="131.9">know how powerful or modern browsers are</span> <span data-start="131.9" data-end="133.31">and you can do so much with them so</span> <span data-start="133.31" data-end="135.65">that's pretty cool and I would say if</span> <span data-start="135.65" data-end="137.239">you're doing a lot of computations that</span> <span data-start="137.239" data-end="139.129">have to do with the specific users that</span> <span data-start="139.129" data-end="140.84">are visiting your systems it's much</span> <span data-start="140.84" data-end="142.549">easier if we do it on the client you</span> <span data-start="142.549" data-end="144.2">have to cash less you have to process</span> <span data-start="144.2" data-end="146.959">less and you're not taking up all those</span> <span data-start="146.959" data-end="149.03">valuable computing resources so</span> <span data-start="149.03" data-end="150.53">maybe you can serve more connections or</span> <span data-start="150.53" data-end="153.56">maybe you can just have more CPU cycles</span> <span data-start="153.56" data-end="156.26">to do whatever with so yeah browsers</span> <span data-start="156.26" data-end="159.83">right so before I talk about the various</span> <span data-start="159.83" data-end="161.06">libraries you can use because that's</span> <span data-start="161.06" data-end="161.93">what we're going to do today I'm going</span> <span data-start="161.93" data-end="163.25">to talk a little bit about three</span> <span data-start="163.25" data-end="164.6">different libraries that have to do a</span> <span data-start="164.6" data-end="166.61">data crunching including one that had</span> <span data-start="166.61" data-end="168.92">co-authored with the Guardian folks but</span> <span data-start="168.92" data-end="170.93">two other ones that are very good at</span> <span data-start="170.93" data-end="172.85">what they do but before we get to that I</span> <span data-start="172.85" data-end="174.41">want to talk about how we actually treat</span> <span data-start="174.41" data-end="176.81">data it's very meta right so so</span> <span data-start="176.81" data-end="178.25">traditionally we think about data as</span> <span data-start="178.25" data-end="180.53">rows of Records if anybody's use sequel</span> <span data-start="180.53" data-end="182.51">or even no sequel whatever call it a</span> <span data-start="182.51" data-end="184.04">document and the end of the day what you</span> <span data-start="184.04" data-end="185.93">have is this collection of properties or</span> <span data-start="185.93" data-end="188.209">dimensions that all combined into us</span> <span data-start="188.209" data-end="190.88">into this collection of rows right so</span> <span data-start="190.88" data-end="192.35">something like that right that's what we</span> <span data-start="192.35" data-end="194.54">expect to have in a client we have this</span> <span data-start="194.54" data-end="196.519">array of objects with names and</span> <span data-start="196.519" data-end="198.709">properties and whatever and that's</span> <span data-start="198.709" data-end="200.81">really great when you are iterating over</span> <span data-start="200.81" data-end="202.31">things right when you're iterating over</span> <span data-start="202.31" data-end="203.66">all those objects and you're displaying</span> <span data-start="203.66" data-end="205.04">them and a list so you're rendering</span> <span data-start="205.04" data-end="207.65">something all is great but it's really</span> <span data-start="207.65" data-end="208.88">bad if you're trying to figure out</span> <span data-start="208.88" data-end="209.93">something about a specific property</span> <span data-start="209.93" data-end="212.69">right so for example i have this age</span> <span data-start="212.69" data-end="214.22">property maybe i want to get an average</span> <span data-start="214.22" data-end="216.049">of it well the first thing i have to do</span> <span data-start="216.049" data-end="218.269">is iterate over all my records and grab</span> <span data-start="218.269" data-end="220.07">that age property right that's pretty</span> <span data-start="220.07" data-end="223.28">wasteful so an alternative way for us to</span> <span data-start="223.28" data-end="226.13">do this is to actually look at column</span> <span data-start="226.13" data-end="228.26">wise databases right so in a column wise</span> <span data-start="228.26" data-end="230.18">representation of your data what you</span> <span data-start="230.18" data-end="232.43">actually have is you have every single</span> <span data-start="232.43" data-end="234.53">data type every dimension every column</span> <span data-start="234.53" data-end="236.9">whatever in its own structure right and</span> <span data-start="236.9" data-end="239.03">the only thing binding these together as</span> <span data-start="239.03" data-end="241.43">a row is the actual index position of</span> <span data-start="241.43" data-end="243.62">those values right so here's the same</span> <span data-start="243.62" data-end="245.66">data that we just represented an</span> <span data-start="245.66" data-end="248">object's but in this column wise store</span> <span data-start="248" data-end="249.89">right so the first array is the name</span> <span data-start="249.89" data-end="251.81">property and it's just the names of</span> <span data-start="251.81" data-end="253.82">whatever we're looking at and the second</span> <span data-start="253.82" data-end="255.859">array is a specific type at these all</span> <span data-start="255.859" data-end="258.229">happen to be heroes and then the bottom</span> <span data-start="258.229" data-end="260.419">one is just those aged numbers right and</span> <span data-start="260.419" data-end="262.46">now the great part is that I just have</span> <span data-start="262.46" data-end="264.68">an array right so I can do a lot of</span> <span data-start="264.68" data-end="266.9">things to it just from the native array</span> <span data-start="266.9" data-end="269.09">implementation or if I really want I can</span> <span data-start="269.09" data-end="271.75">go ahead and use underscore or whatever</span> <span data-start="271.75" data-end="273.979">textually process that but at the very</span> <span data-start="273.979" data-end="276.2">least I have all these data types all</span> <span data-start="276.2" data-end="278.8">these data fragments in in single arrays</span> <span data-start="278.8" data-end="281.599">so this talks can have a lot of code</span> <span data-start="281.599" data-end="282.15">which is</span> <span data-start="282.15" data-end="283.77">cool if you have Wi-Fi access which</span> <span data-start="283.77" data-end="286.11">comes and goes feel free to check

data-end="503.49">property is not  because for</span> <span data-start="503.49" data-end="505.409">some heroes that value is  and</span> <span data-start="505.409" data-end="507.84">then I do the same thing for my female</span> <span data-start="507.84" data-end="509.789">heroes and then here's an example of an</span> <span data-start="509.789" data-end="512.459">and that's kind of cool i say that type</span> <span data-start="512.459" data-end="513.69">of be here on the height is not</span> <span data-start="513.69" data-end="515.459">and then the gender is not</span> <span data-start="515.459" data-end="517.74">male and is not female so you can sort</span> <span data-start="517.74" data-end="520.02">of pass this array of objects so it's</span> <span data-start="520.02" data-end="521.13">pretty cool and you can do a lot of</span> <span data-start="521.13" data-end="524.55">things in terms of querying or data and</span> <span data-start="524.55" data-end="525.42">so it's that we'll look at an example</span> <span data-start="525.42" data-end="528.3">right so I was very curious as to</span> <span data-start="528.3" data-end="531">whether certain capabilities appear</span> <span data-start="531" data-end="533.61">together or not so if I'm faster and I</span> <span data-start="533.61" data-end="536.279">also better combat or not so if you want</span> <span data-start="536.279" data-end="537.81">look at the code the example is under</span> <span data-start="537.81" data-end="540.54">taffy the under staffy dashdb space</span> <span data-start="540.54" data-end="542.85">competencies that HTML and there's a</span> <span data-start="542.85" data-end="544.23">chance bin that's slightly out of date</span> <span data-start="544.23" data-end="548.459">but so what we want to do first really</span> <span data-start="548.459" data-end="549.12">are</span> <span data-start="549.12" data-end="551.55">pretty much the only taffy part of this</span> <span data-start="551.55" data-end="553.92">of this example is to find all the</span> <span data-start="553.92" data-end="555.33">heroes that have all the competencies</span> <span data-start="555.33" data-end="556.83">defined right because the last thing we</span> <span data-start="556.83" data-end="559.41">want is to be comparing ones that have</span> <span data-start="559.41" data-end="561.45">some don't have some so this is me</span> <span data-start="561.45" data-end="563.7">really pretty much to sue my query I go</span> <span data-start="563.7" data-end="565.26">ahead and I say give me the six that I'd</span> <span data-start="565.26" data-end="568.05">shown you and make sure that they are</span> <span data-start="568.05" data-end="570.15">not  right so and then the rest</span> <span data-start="570.15" data-end="572.76">of this is actually a bunch of d3 code</span> <span data-start="572.76" data-end="574.5">which I'm not going to go over even</span> <span data-start="574.5" data-end="575.43">though pulsed I don't want to talk about</span> <span data-start="575.43" data-end="578.31">visualizing big data not going to do</span> <span data-start="578.31" data-end="580.62">that to you guys but here's an example</span> <span data-start="580.62" data-end="582.779">of what that built right so what that</span> <span data-start="582.779" data-end="584.64">did is it selected all the superheroes I</span> <span data-start="584.64" data-end="585.93">have all those abilities and then I</span> <span data-start="585.93" data-end="587.76">built this very slowly scatter plot</span> <span data-start="587.76" data-end="589.95">where I can say oh how does my power</span> <span data-start="589.95" data-end="591.48">compared my power well that's a stupid</span> <span data-start="591.48" data-end="593.22">question but how does intelligence</span> <span data-start="593.22" data-end="595.02">comparator our right so it looks like</span> <span data-start="595.02" data-end="597.9">just about all the heroes are clustered</span> <span data-start="597.9" data-end="599.46">and kind of the mid-range intelligence</span> <span data-start="599.46" data-end="602.25">and so on and so forth I don't know how</span> <span data-start="602.25" data-end="604.23">they have to do with combat also not not</span> <span data-start="604.23" data-end="606.69">that different but it looks like most</span> <span data-start="606.69" data-end="608.61">superheroes are kind of on the slow end</span> <span data-start="608.61" data-end="610.8">so that's kind of interesting right so</span> <span data-start="610.8" data-end="615.839">that's a quick example of taffy and you</span> <span data-start="615.839" data-end="616.86">know let me know later if you have any</span> <span data-start="616.86" data-end="619.05">questions about that and the next</span> <span data-start="619.05" data-end="621.42">library I want to talk about is cross</span> <span data-start="621.42" data-end="624.18">filter so I used III a bunch in my work</span> <span data-start="624.18" data-end="626.58">and it was written by a really great guy</span> <span data-start="626.58" data-end="629.43">and Mike Michael Bostock who writes a</span> <span data-start="629.43" data-end="632.04">lot of amazing dataviz and he's also</span> <span data-start="632.04" data-end="633.66">written this library crawl called cross</span> <span data-start="633.66" data-end="636.24">filter which has to do with dealing with</span> <span data-start="636.24" data-end="637.83">high dimensional data so it is</span> <span data-start="637.83" data-end="640.38">incredibly fast because it uses type</span> <span data-start="640.38" data-end="642.72">arrays very heavily the thing it doesn't</span> <span data-start="642.72" data-end="644.55">do very well is actually deal with</span> <span data-start="644.55" data-end="647.37">incomplete or messy data before I get</span> <span data-start="647.37" data-end="648.57">into that I want to show just an example</span> <span data-start="648.57" data-end="650.85">of how you would use cross filter so</span> <span data-start="650.85" data-end="652.38">again you would sort of call the cross</span> <span data-start="652.38" data-end="654.93">filter function and pass it your array</span> <span data-start="654.93" data-end="657.51">of objects in case case heroes and then</span> <span data-start="657.51" data-end="658.35">what you do is you build these</span> <span data-start="658.35" data-end="660.15">dimensions a dimension is really just</span> <span data-start="660.15" data-end="662.37">the cash right we've all created cash</span> <span data-start="662.37" data-end="664.35">objects was just an object with a key</span> <span data-start="664.35" data-end="666.779">and then either an array of our objects</span> <span data-start="666.779" data-end="669.3">or just single objects the same thing is</span> <span data-start="669.3" data-end="671.16">done by cross filter except he calls it</span> <span data-start="671.16" data-end="673.62">a dimension and so and they can be a</span> <span data-start="673.62" data-end="674.97">little more flexible and that you can</span> <span data-start="674.97" data-end="677.1">actually you know combine them in</span> <span data-start="677.1" data-end="678.329">whatever way you want by using this</span> <span data-start="678.329" data-end="680.97">callback function so in this case I'm</span> <span data-start="680.97" data-end="682.649">really just creating a dimension on the</span> <span data-start="682.649" data-end="684.149">intelligence property right because we</span> <span data-start="684.149" data-end="685.769">really what I want to do is be very</span> <span data-start="685.769" data-end="687.899">quickly able to get all the heroes of</span> <span data-start="687.899" data-end="690.66">intelligence Oh point 75 or something</span> <span data-start="690.66" data-end="693.119">right so once i have my dimension builds</span> <span data-start="693.119" data-end="694.8">the next thing i can do is actually call</span> <span data-start="694.8" data-end="696.749">a filter so i'm going to say okay give</span> <span data-start="696.749" data-end="699.569">me all give me a filter that only gets</span> <span data-start="699.569" data-end="702.809">me the here is between 0 and 0.25 right</span> <span data-start="702.809" data-end="704.639">so that creates a filtering and then</span> <span data-start="704.639" data-end="706.29">actually go and get the top records so</span> <span data-start="706.29" data-end="709.559">dot top infinity really clear API not</span> <span data-start="709.559" data-end="711.749">and you know what I'm done I have to</span> <span data-start="711.749" data-end="713.819">clear my filtering again so that's an</span> <span data-start="713.819" data-end="715.679">example of using cross filter and</span> <span data-start="715.679" data-end="716.879">there's all sorts of additional things</span> <span data-start="716.879" data-end="718.73">you can do on top of that you can group</span> <span data-start="718.73" data-end="721.41">things so for example here what I've</span> <span data-start="721.41" data-end="722.91">really done is I made a group right I</span> <span data-start="722.91" data-end="724.41">said I'll give me the group of things in</span> <span data-start="724.41" data-end="727.259">between these brackets but there's</span> <span data-start="727.259" data-end="728.97">actual kind of a contract for that call</span> <span data-start="728.97" data-end="732.6">the group so I mentioned typed arrays a</span> <span data-start="732.6" data-end="733.74">little bit now i'll talk about them</span> <span data-start="733.74" data-end="735.36">because territories are really really</span> <span data-start="735.36" data-end="737.579">cool they allow you to very quickly</span> <span data-start="737.579" data-end="739.649">manipulate rob binary data because what</span> <span data-start="739.649" data-end="741.269">you start off with is just an array</span> <span data-start="741.269" data-end="742.829">buffer and then you kind of say oh I'm</span> <span data-start="742.829" data-end="744.629">going to look at it at 8-bit chunks or</span> <span data-start="744.629" data-end="747.24">at 16-bit chunks or whatever and it's</span> <span data-start="747.24" data-end="749.22">nice because they initialize by default</span> <span data-start="749.22" data-end="751.559">20 instead of  which is what</span> <span data-start="751.559" data-end="752.85">traditional JavaScript arrays</span> <span data-start="752.85" data-end="754.86">initialized to which is really fun if</span> <span data-start="754.86" data-end="757.74">you've ever done data things and it's</span> <span data-start="757.74" data-end="759.329">nice because you can share buffers you</span> <span data-start="759.329" data-end="760.92">can have multiple views applied to the</span> <span data-start="760.92" data-end="763.199">same array buffer and if you know the</span> <span data-start="763.199" data-end="764.61">dimensions of your data if you know</span> <span data-start="764.61" data-end="766.23">you're only going to look at values from</span> <span data-start="766.23" data-end="769.23">0 to 255 that's great because you can</span> <span data-start="769.23" data-end="771.8">have a really small memory footprint but</span> <span data-start="771.8" data-end="774.779">the problem with typed arrays is that</span> <span data-start="774.779" data-end="776.639">just about anything that doesn't conform</span> <span data-start="776.639" data-end="779.399">within the dimensions you specified is</span> <span data-start="779.399" data-end="781.74">going to turn into a zero so an an an</span> <span data-start="781.74" data-end="784.319">string or even the value that</span> <span data-start="784.319" data-end="786.35">is outside the range right so here I'm</span> <span data-start="786.35" data-end="790.319">defining an unsigned 8-bit integer array</span> <span data-start="790.319" data-end="792.029">and what that means is I can fit value</span> <span data-start="792.029" data-end="794.939">from 0 until 255 into it and what</span> <span data-start="794.939" data-end="796.529">happens when I put a value outside that</span> <span data-start="796.529" data-end="799.319">range for example 258 what I actually</span> <span data-start="799.319" data-end="801.329">get is the number two because it's kind</span> <span data-start="801.329" data-end="803.1">of just roll over it just does not have</span> <span data-start="803.1" data-end="805.319">enough bits to fit that data so you have</span> <span data-start="805.319" data-end="807.389">to be very careful because you're not</span> <span data-start="807.389" data-end="809.009">actually going to know that this is not</span> <span data-start="809.009" data-end="810.66">going to throw an error right and the</span> <span data-start="810.66" data-end="814.529">same happens in cross filter if you put</span> <span data-start="814.529" data-end="816.089">through data and you don't filter it</span> <span data-start="816.089" data-end="816.63">appropriately</span> <span data-start="816.63" data-end="818.13">don't clean it up appropriately or it</span> <span data-start="818.13" data-end="820.47">has kind of little pitfalls it's not</span> <span data-start="820.47" data-end="821.97">going to air out what you are going to</span> <span data-start="821.97" data-end="825.15">get is slightly wrong answers so you</span> <span data-start="825.15" data-end="827.19">might get a filtration of 100 records</span> <span data-start="827.19" data-end="828.72">and two of those records don't actually</span> <span data-start="828.72" data-end="831.3">belong and as someone who spent like two</span> <span data-start="831.3" data-end="833.07">days debugging stuff like that it's</span> <span data-start="833.07" data-end="835.86">really not fun so so typed arrays kind</span> <span data-start="835.86" data-end="839.28">of yay kind of nay and so but</span> <span data-start="839.28" data-end="841.05">nonetheless crossroads is very cool so I</span> <span data-start="841.05" data-end="842.43">actually thought okay now we looked a</span> <span data-start="842.43" data-end="844.8">little bit at these competencies now I'm</span> <span data-start="844.8" data-end="846.09">very curious to see how they're actually</span> <span data-start="846.09" data-end="847.44">distributed right so I want to look at</span> <span data-start="847.44" data-end="849.54">the histograms hopefully focused on what</span> <span data-start="849.54" data-end="851.4">those are so if you want to look at the</span> <span data-start="851.4" data-end="853.59">code it's under cross filter / visual</span> <span data-start="853.59" data-end="857.87">data HTML and we're going to look at the</span> <span data-start="857.87" data-end="861.18">all that does not very complicated what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="861.18" data-end="863.13">I do is I for every single competency I</span> <span data-start="863.13" data-end="864.72">take all the values for all my heroes</span> <span data-start="864.72" data-end="867.48">and then I bend them in this case in 27</span> <span data-start="867.48" data-end="871.38">bins randomly selected number and I just</span> <span data-start="871.38" data-end="873.12">try to kind of aggregate to see how many</span> <span data-start="873.12" data-end="875.31">i have in each in each grouping so for</span> <span data-start="875.31" data-end="877.35">example you can see my intelligence very</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="877.35" data-end="879.83">Gaussian distributed that's good to know</span> <span data-start="879.83" data-end="882.54">combat almost so not so much and</span> <span data-start="882.54" data-end="885.18">durability for some reason just a lot in</span> <span data-start="885.18" data-end="887.34">the extremes and then kind of strength</span> <span data-start="887.34" data-end="889.65">is all over the place for most part and</span> <span data-start="889.65" data-end="891.39">definitely a lot more slower heroes and</span> <span data-start="891.39" data-end="893.37">villains then pass one so kind of</span> <span data-start="893.37" data-end="895.89">interesting but we can look very quickly</span> <span data-start="895.89" data-end="898.53">at the code that put that together so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="898.53" data-end="900.63">I'm gonna zoom out a little bit</span> <span data-start="900.63" data-end="902.13">hopefully you guys can see these screens</span> <span data-start="902.13" data-end="906.15">are so tiny so the first thing we're</span> <span data-start="906.15" data-end="908.22">going to do and this again is not really</span> <span data-start="908.22" data-end="909.96">cross filter this is me using underscore</span> <span data-start="909.96" data-end="912.21">because again I'm trying to first reduce</span> <span data-start="912.21" data-end="915.06">my data to make sure i only have records</span> <span data-start="915.06" data-end="916.68">that aren't going to break cross filter</span> <span data-start="916.68" data-end="919.2">so here i just iterate over all of them</span> <span data-start="919.2" data-end="920.76">and make sure they're not  or</span> <span data-start="920.76" data-end="923.4">nan and then only get those those</span> <span data-start="923.4" data-end="925.74">records um but then what I really do is</span> <span data-start="925.74" data-end="927.06">for every competency I build this</span> <span data-start="927.06" data-end="930">dimension and then I go and I fetch my</span> <span data-start="930" data-end="932.28">records and I get my mins in the max the</span> <span data-start="932.28" data-end="933.9">other nice thing across filter does when</span> <span data-start="933.9" data-end="935.4">you build a dimensions is it sorts it</span> <span data-start="935.4" data-end="938.01">for you so if you have numbers the max</span> <span data-start="938.01" data-end="939.24">is always going to be the first record</span> <span data-start="939.24" data-end="940.77">and the men is always going to be the</span> <span data-start="940.77" data-end="943.44">bottom record so that's exciting and</span> <span data-start="943.44" data-end="945.87">then I go and I kind of built my my bins</span> <span data-start="945.87" data-end="947.37">that I talked about kind of that first</span> <span data-start="947.37" data-end="949.17">example and then here I do the actual</span> <span data-start="949.17" data-end="950.07">grouping</span> <span data-start="950.07" data-end="951.66">and I fetch my records and I do the</span> <span data-start="951.66" data-end="954">little sparkline chart so not very</span> <span data-start="954" data-end="956.67">complicated but again very handy and if</span> <span data-start="956.67" data-end="957.93">you look at some of the examples across</span> <span data-start="957.93" data-end="959.34">filter there's a lot of cross</span> <span data-start="959.34" data-end="962.1">coordination stuff that that he does
