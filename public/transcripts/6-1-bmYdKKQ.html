data-end="20.08">we've been stealing code for years in</span> <span data-start="20.08" data-end="22.84">order to protect our identity I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="22.84" data-end="26.079">Todd

data-end="64.21">knows who we are then we steal code well</span> <span data-start="64.21" data-end="68.29">so everybody does it no no they don't</span> <span data-start="68.29" data-end="69.79">otherwise everybody in this room</span> <span data-start="69.79" data-end="72.19">everybody in our community we'd all be</span> <span data-start="72.19" data-end="74.92">wearing masks oh yeah they kind of do</span> <span data-start="74.92" data-end="80.26">steal code github isn't stealing code of</span> <span data-start="80.26" data-end="81.7">course it is you browse into somebody's</span> <span data-start="81.7" data-end="83.59">code you look at how they did it then</span> <span data-start="83.59" data-end="85.18">maybe you take it and write it yourself</span> <span data-start="85.18" data-end="88.39">or worse yet you cut and paste it well</span> <span data-start="88.39" data-end="93.85">sure but well how about this I bet every</span> <span data-start="93.85" data-end="95.65">single person in this room has gotten to</span> <span data-start="95.65" data-end="98.35">this site copied some snippet of code</span> <span data-start="98.35" data-end="100.96">and paste it into your project that's</span> <span data-start="100.96" data-end="102.91">not stealing code it's the entire point</span> <span data-start="102.91" data-end="105.01">of stack overflow really because they're</span> <span data-start="105.01" data-end="107.56">copyright policy specifically says they</span> <span data-start="107.56" data-end="111.82">own everything oh except not every

sure before</span> <span data-start="176.48" data-end="179.15">get up there was sourceforge all right</span> <span data-start="179.15" data-end="180.799">right I before that we would go into the</span> <span data-start="180.799" data-end="183.59">forums right you guys remember digging</span> <span data-start="183.59" data-end="185.06">through all the PHP forums just to</span> <span data-start="185.06" data-end="187.94">figure out how to write a blog well sure</span> <span data-start="187.94" data-end="191.23">except picked yeah PHP completely sucks</span> <span data-start="191.23" data-end="196.459">come on man so what were you doing</span> <span data-start="196.459" data-end="199.94">before you troll the forums um well i</span> <span data-start="199.94" data-end="202.82">first learned java script using view</span> <span data-start="202.82" data-end="204.859">source in the 90s all right view source</span> <span data-start="204.859" data-end="207.35">let's that's great what was the last</span> <span data-start="207.35" data-end="208.94">time you needed that I mean browser dev</span> <span data-start="208.94" data-end="211.43">tools today are amazing well even before</span> <span data-start="211.43" data-end="213.35">that we had all these these magazines</span> <span data-start="213.35" data-end="215.45">with code in them right so you would</span> <span data-start="215.45" data-end="217.819">open the magazine sit down and then like</span> <span data-start="217.819" data-end="219.829">type the code from the magazine into</span> <span data-start="219.829" data-end="221.93">your computer but that's that's not</span> <span data-start="221.93" data-end="223.91">stealing oh I was just using those</span> <span data-start="223.91" data-end="226.01">magazines to figure out how how to do it</span> <span data-start="226.01" data-end="228.26">well it still sounds fundamentally like</span> <span data-start="228.26" data-end="231.92">a cut-and-paste job well how did you</span> <span data-start="231.92" data-end="233.75">start programming well I started on one</span> <span data-start="233.75" data-end="236.63">of these sweet Commodore pets</span> <span data-start="236.63" data-end="238.76">but how did you start programming it</span> <span data-start="238.76" data-end="241.16">well I just leaned over to the kid next</span> <span data-start="241.16" data-end="243.83">to me and asked him what up today and he</span> <span data-start="243.83" data-end="245.39">showed you what well he showed me his</span> <span data-start="245.39" data-end="249.92">coat and you copied it well we didn't</span> <span data-start="249.92" data-end="253.76">have cut and paste back then but you</span> <span data-start="253.76" data-end="256.67">typed it in well yeah he told me what</span> <span data-start="256.67" data-end="260.33">the time thus you stole his code but</span> <span data-start="260.33" data-end="262.73">what did you do next well I started</span> <span data-start="262.73" data-end="264.08">changing things I started trying things</span> <span data-start="264.08" data-end="269.69">out you made it your own exactly instead</span> <span data-start="269.69" data-end="271.58">of an asterisk chasing a pound side I</span> <span data-start="271.58" data-end="275.69">made it chase a dog so you took his idea</span> <span data-start="275.69" data-end="277.94">and you subverted it in your own manner</span> <span data-start="277.94" data-end="280.13">well but does it be active changing</span> <span data-start="280.13" data-end="283.43">something make it mine and not his like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="283.43" data-end="290.33">I guess I I don't think you could</span> <span data-start="290.33" data-end="292.13">copyright an idea after all you just</span> <span data-start="292.13" data-end="295.04">copy write the expression of the idea so</span> <span data-start="295.04" data-end="297.08">you're telling me we're not criminals I</span> <span data-start="297.08" data-end="301.22">think so you're suggesting that the act</span> <span data-start="301.22" data-end="303.35">of changing what we steal makes it legit</span> <span data-start="303.35" data-end="305.45">well I think it's a little more</span> <span data-start="305.45" data-end="307.64">complicated than that you know while</span> <span data-start="307.64" data-end="310.66">you're though well but what about the</span> <span data-start="310.66" data-end="315.23">what about the fair use clause well what</span> <span data-start="315.23" data-end="316.7">about when your client comes to you and</span> <span data-start="316.7" data-end="318.59">they say they want a parallax site and</span> <span data-start="318.59" data-end="319.79">you've never even heard what a parallax</span> <span data-start="319.79" data-end="322.4">site is does the research aspect come</span> <span data-start="322.4" data-end="323.81">into play when you cut and paste from</span> <span data-start="323.81" data-end="326.3">stack overflow well again I'm not a</span> <span data-start="326.3" data-end="328.91">lawyer no no you're not but I do think</span> <span data-start="328.91" data-end="331.96">there's a good kind of code stealing</span> <span data-start="331.96" data-end="335.42">good stealing sure otherwise all these</span> <span data-start="335.42" data-end="337.94">people are in a lot of trouble so how do</span> <span data-start="337.94" data-end="339.56">you know what is good stealing and what</span> <span data-start="339.56" data-end="341.84">is bad stealing oh I think it comes down</span> <span data-start="341.84" data-end="346.46">to intent intent sure why are you</span> <span data-start="346.46" data-end="348.62">stealing the code is it to take money</span> <span data-start="348.62" data-end="350.18">away from the copyright owner or are you</span> <span data-start="350.18" data-end="351.8">just trying to finish the customer's</span> <span data-start="351.8" data-end="353.15">request so you can go home to your wife</span> <span data-start="353.15" data-end="355.04">and kids or are you just trying to learn</span> <span data-start="355.04" data-end="358.67">how to do it for yourself so you think</span> <span data-start="358.67" data-end="360.83">it's okay if our intent is to learn</span> <span data-start="360.83" data-end="363.89">right it has to be again otherwise the</span> <span data-start="363.89" data-end="365.69">whole industry is in trouble how's that</span> <span data-start="365.69" data-end="368.21">well think back to your days using view</span> <span data-start="368.21" data-end="370.16">source copying the code</span> <span data-start="370.16" data-end="372.98">code that you saw there well I didn't</span> <span data-start="372.98" data-end="375.77">copy it per se of course you did but you</span> <span data-start="375.77" data-end="378.32">changed it right well yeah I wanted to</span> <span data-start="378.32" data-end="382.31">see how it worked and then you change</span> <span data-start="382.31" data-end="385.22">this some more sure and so on your</span> <span data-start="385.22" data-end="387.62">learning through the change yeah that's</span> <span data-start="387.62" data-end="389.51">how I work right well that's my point we</span> <span data-start="389.51" data-end="391.82">have an entire industry of canker it's</span> <span data-start="391.82" data-end="395.09">baked into what we do okay I see we</span> <span data-start="395.09" data-end="396.98">steal the code to learn and then we</span> <span data-start="396.98" data-end="400.61">learn by tinkering right well my</span> <span data-start="400.61" data-end="401.81">daughter does the exact same thing</span> <span data-start="401.81" data-end="421.67">really watch this she's pretty cute this</span> <span data-start="421.67" data-end="423.5">is true but my point is that she's</span> <span data-start="423.5" data-end="425.96">learning by exploring she's trying new</span> <span data-start="425.96" data-end="428.87">things she's gaining experienced or</span> <span data-start="428.87" data-end="430.73">experimentation or as they say in this</span> <span data-start="430.73" data-end="432.71">slide here the bottom two lines the</span> <span data-start="432.71" data-end="434.81">practice by doing and immediate use</span> <span data-start="434.81" data-end="436.79">right actually when you think about it</span> <span data-start="436.79" data-end="440.32">it's the primary way that people learned</span> <span data-start="440.32" data-end="443.54">we replicate we change we observe and</span> <span data-start="443.54" data-end="446.45">then we understand the except when we</span> <span data-start="446.45" data-end="448.25">fail no well failing as part of the</span> <span data-start="448.25" data-end="451.19">process well fail often fail fast and</span> <span data-start="451.19" data-end="456.56">learn always the goal of experimentation</span> <span data-start="456.56" data-end="458.86">whether successful or not is</span> <span data-start="458.86" data-end="462.2">understanding so I steal code but in a</span> <span data-start="462.2" data-end="464.27">good way to experiment on it and</span> <span data-start="464.27" data-end="466.73">ultimately gain new understanding and</span> <span data-start="466.73" data-end="470.36">then build on that build on that sure</span> <span data-start="470.36" data-end="472.16">once you understand something you can</span> <span data-start="472.16" data-end="473.69">use it to understand the next thing up</span> <span data-start="473.69" data-end="476.69">the chain the bigger understanding but</span> <span data-start="476.69" data-end="479">if that's how we learn why did I spend</span> <span data-start="479" data-end="480.32">all those years or more importantly all</span> <span data-start="480.32" data-end="484.28">that money doing this okay you bring up</span> <span data-start="484.28" data-end="487.28">a great point me I did the other</span> <span data-start="487.28" data-end="489.56">approach is rote learning where the</span> <span data-start="489.56" data-end="491.24">understanding is dictated to you and</span> <span data-start="491.24" data-end="492.669">you're supposed to accept it as fact</span> <span data-start="492.669" data-end="496.88">well but again as we see here the</span> <span data-start="496.88" data-end="498.289">retention rate from lecture based</span> <span data-start="498.289" data-end="500.78">learning is really really low well</span> <span data-start="500.78" data-end="502.7">exactly there's no chance to explore</span> <span data-start="502.7" data-end="503.54">what you learned</span> <span data-start="503.54" data-end="506.36">it's all memorization but you're working</span> <span data-start="506.36" data-end="508.07">from the top down lectures reading</span> <span data-start="508.07" data-end="511.04">presentations there isn't a chance to do</span> <span data-start="511.04" data-end="513.52">anything right it's a different tactic</span> <span data-start="513.52" data-end="516.05">they give you the understanding and then</span> <span data-start="516.05" data-end="517.97">they let you figure out how to prove it</span> <span data-start="517.97" data-end="520.82">but the stealing way you're figuring out</span> <span data-start="520.82" data-end="522.47">how something works and then you can't</span> <span data-start="522.47" data-end="525.95">understanding yes so that's great news</span> <span data-start="525.95" data-end="529.67">because school sucks okay I'm not saying</span> <span data-start="529.67" data-end="532.52">that there's a place for both well</span> <span data-start="532.52" data-end="534.11">except the bottom-up approach is more</span> <span data-start="534.11" data-end="536.24">how we work we've already admitted to</span> <span data-start="536.24" data-end="538.37">all these people that were stealing code</span> <span data-start="538.37" data-end="540.08">and tinkering on it well maybe that's</span> <span data-start="540.08" data-end="541.4">the problem with how we're teaching our</span> <span data-start="541.4" data-end="543.38">next generation so too much</span> <span data-start="543.38" data-end="546.1">book-learning not enough experimentation</span> <span data-start="546.1" data-end="548.39">it's almost too rigid we end up with</span> <span data-start="548.39" data-end="550.49">college graduates who don't understand</span> <span data-start="550.49" data-end="552.32">the why the things why things work the</span> <span data-start="552.32" data-end="554.54">way they do they often lack the tools to</span> <span data-start="554.54" data-end="557.66">figure it out so how do they get those</span> <span data-start="557.66" data-end="559.73">tools how does a person that's been</span> <span data-start="559.73" data-end="562.1">shorted the ability to tinker learn to</span> <span data-start="562.1" data-end="565.13">take her how do we teach people to steal</span> <span data-start="565.13" data-end="568.31">it a good way well it's a really</span> <span data-start="568.31" data-end="570.17">interesting topic but for now we're</span> <span data-start="570.17" data-end="572.06">going to take a little detour alright</span> <span data-start="572.06" data-end="575.51">lets out this is the Mona Lisa oh it's</span> <span

data-end="879.7">to help them learn the lay of the land</span> <span data-start="879.7" data-end="882.69">well you can use your workflow to teach</span> <span data-start="882.69" data-end="885.79">how do you mean like teaching a pull</span> <span data-start="885.79" data-end="888.76">request workflow for code reviews yeah</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="888.76" data-end="891.19">I'm still not following okay you use</span> <span data-start="891.19" data-end="893.14">your workflow process to automate things</span> <span

data-end="919.33">asking for learn to learn by creating a</span> <span data-start="919.33" data-end="921.15">conversation but about what you're doing</span> <span data-start="921.15"

data-end="930.49">good process is everything it really all</span> <span data-start="930.49" data-end="933.43">depends on your company having a culture</span> <span data-start="933.43" data-end="936.28">of learning the process that fosters</span> <span data-start="936.28" data-end="938.8">learning okay but that that has to come</span> <span data-start="938.8" data-end="942.43">from

data-end="963.12">think a lot of managers would disagree</span> <span data-start="963.12" data-end="967">they're always too busy if they didn't</span> <span data-start="967" data-end="969.82">want to
