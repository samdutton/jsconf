data-end="129.66">persistent storage we need it for</span> <span data-start="129.66" data-end="131.28">several things on the one hand we needed</span> <span data-start="131.28" data-end="134.09">for

data-end="188.63">dark past and moving towards the bright</span> <span data-start="188.63" data-end="191.39">future and we have a more detailed look</span> <span data-start="191.39" data-end="195.97">at two of the engines presented here</span> <span data-start="195.97" data-end="200.21">which are currently the best available</span> <span data-start="200.21"

basically no api</span> <span data-start="226.21" data-end="228.08">you need to write your own wrapper</span> <span data-start="228.08" data-end="231.38">functions or you rely on the framework</span> <span data-start="231.38" data-end="233.51">that that's the work for you so I guess</span> <span data-start="233.51" data-end="235.01">you know everything about cookie so</span> <span

data-end="870.47">another thing is cross window messaging</span> <span data-start="870.47" data-end="874.71">the storage event is supposed to fire on</span> <span data-start="874.71"

data-end="986.67">into the future there is indexed DB a</span> <span data-start="986.67" data-end="989.699">new draft containing the object store</span> <span data-start="989.699" data-end="994.74">which has the great point that it can</span> <span data-start="994.74" data-end="997.29">store objects all other storage engines</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="997.29" data-end="999.209">I've been mentioning can only store</span> <span data-start="999.209" data-end="1006.079">strings so then you'd have to Jason</span> <span

data-start="1010.61" data-end="1019.53">you to store j/s objects directly it</span> <span data-start="1019.54" data-end="1024.819">will be both a key value engine and a</span> <span data-start="1024.819" data-end="1028.069">real database because you will have a</span> <span data-start="1028.069" data-end="1031.4">synchronous API with gad input methods</span> <span data-start="1031.4" data-end="1033.14">and so you can use it as a key value</span> <span data-start="1033.14" data-end="1036.14">store but it will also have a database</span> <span data-start="1036.14" data-end="1040.4">like access that you can query the store</span> <span data-start="1040.4" data-end="1041.299">you can</span> <span data-start="1041.299" data-end="1045.139">create ranges and you can iterate</span> <span data-start="1045.139" data-end="1047.509">through result sets and move the cursor</span> <span data-start="1047.509" data-end="1050.119">so it tries to combine best of both</span> <span data-start="1050.119" data-end="1054.789">worlds and it's very very promising a</span> <span data-start="1054.789" data-end="1058.869">next EP is probably our biggest hope to</span> <span data-start="1058.869" data-end="1062.989">help us in our storage needs constable</span> <span data-start="1062.989" data-end="1064.639">it's not really there yet you can play</span> <span data-start="1064.639" data-end="1067.159">around with it it's there in Firefox 4</span> <span data-start="1067.159" data-end="1069.559">and latest minefield builds and it's</span> <span data-start="1069.559" data-end="1073.85">prefixed with a mo Zhi underscore prefix</span> <span data-start="1073.85"

data-end="1082.519">implementation yet but it's still on</span> <span data-start="1082.519" data-end="1085.659">well you can already play around with it</span> <span data-start="1085.659" data-end="1088.22">next thing for the future will be the</span> <span data-start="1088.22" data-end="1091.7">file API because the file API from the</span> <span data-start="1091.7" data-end="1094.58">specification will allow us to open</span> <span data-start="1094.58" data-end="1097.489">through the browser a file on the user's</span> <span data-start="1097.489" data-end="1099.859">filesystem a new file where we can store</span> <span data-start="1099.859" data-end="1106.399">data in it which is very interesting but</span> <span data-start="1106.399" data-end="1109.009">it's it will only be a flat file thing</span> <span data-start="1109.009" data-end="1110.899">so if you really want it as a store</span> <span data-start="1110.899" data-end="1114.159">you'd have to do a lot of extra work to</span> <span data-start="1114.159" data-end="1117.23">have do to manage your keys and</span> <span data-start="1117.23" data-end="1118.789">everything but it might be a good</span> <span data-start="1118.789" data-end="1120.47">alternative if you try to store a really</span> <span data-start="1120.47" data-end="1123.169">large amounts of data say if you got</span> <span data-start="1123.169" data-end="1124.879">like some hundred images you want to</span> <span data-start="1124.879" data-end="1126.59">store on the client site or anything and</span> <span data-start="1126.59" data-end="1129.59">this might be a good choice because it</span> <span data-start="1129.59" data-end="1133.789">well directly lifts on the file system</span> <span data-start="1133.789" data-end="1136.19">of the user it's also there in Firefox</span> <span data-start="1136.19" data-end="1140.809">and latest minefields but I got the</span> <span data-start="1140.809" data-end="1142.369">feeling this will take a long time until</span> <span data-start="1142.369" data-end="1145.159">we can really work with the file API but</span> <span data-start="1145.159" data-end="1148.999">finally is all the bus and let's hope</span> <span data-start="1148.999" data-end="1155.059">that things are moving there what they</span> <span data-start="1155.059" data-end="1156.859">did not mention or plucking based</span> <span data-start="1156.859"

data-end="1170.779">plug-in independent client-side storage</span> <span data-start="1170.779" data-end="1174.08">so let's move on to the main question</span> <span data-start="1174.08" data-end="1176.779">which of course is what engine for my</span> <span data-start="1176.779" data-end="1179.57">project all that on the one hand depends</span> <span data-start="1179.57" data-end="1182.779">on on your needs of course and on the</span> <span data-start="1182.779" data-end="1184.309">other hand it basically depends on the</span> <span data-start="1184.309"

data-end="1193.88">cases you just do not know that means</span> <span data-start="1193.88" data-end="1196.58">you have to do a multi-engine approach</span> <span data-start="1196.58" data-end="1199.64">you need to be prepared to deal with all</span> <span data-start="1199.64" data-end="1202.7">engines that are out there you get a</span> <span data-start="1202.7" data-end="1205.07">search for the best available engine and</span> <span data-start="1205.07" data-end="1207.679">then just step down step by step until</span> <span data-start="1207.679" data-end="1211.1">you find an available engine and use</span> <span data-start="1211.1" data-end="1215.059">that one this really sounds like pretty</span> <span data-start="1215.059" data-end="1216.559">much work especially if you want a</span> <span data-start="1216.559" data-end="1219.49">unified API for your storage application</span> <span data-start="1219.49" data-end="1222.019">but rest assured of course there are</span> <span data-start="1222.019" data-end="1225.139">frameworks that do the work for you as</span> <span data-start="1225.139"

data-end="1658.37">um yeah I just got to be creative fool</span> <span data-start="1658.37" data-end="1660.74">around with the device you're targeting</span> <span data-start="1660.74" data-end="1664.82">and see if there are some crazy options</span> <span data-start="1664.82" data-end="1667.84">that are not standards approach but</span> <span data-start="1667.84" data-end="1671.12">which are there any help Jesus time is</span> <span data-start="1671.12" data-end="1672.11">running out</span> <span data-start="1672.11" data-end="1675.92">okay quick frameworks for that no not</span> <span data-start="1675.92" data-end="1680.67">not not one and you really want want to</span> <span data-start="1680.67" data-end="1684.27">throw a full-sized bloated framework on</span> <span data-start="1684.27" data-end="1688.77">a phone but very shortly and there be</span> <span data-start="1688.77" data-end="1691.16">storage j/s which I initially wanted to</span> <span data-start="1691.16" data-end="1696.27">release but just didn't manage which is</span> <span data-start="1696.27" data-end="1698.91">especially targeted at embedded devices</span> <span data-start="1698.91" data-end="1701.22">and which uses the ambit jes approach</span> <span data-start="1701.22" data-end="1703.77">that means that you only deploy what you</span> <span data-start="1703.77" data-end="1707.46">what you what you need so that you have</span> <span data-start="1707.46" data-end="1710.37">specific builds with a maximum or the</span> <span data-start="1710.37" data-end="1712.68">the smallest possible footprint for your</span> <span data-start="1712.68" data-end="1715.89">target device so it will be super tiny</span> <span data-start="1715.89" data-end="1718.29">in size and currently supports cookie</span> <span data-start="1718.29" data-end="1720.72">local storage wichard preference store</span> <span data-start="1720.72" data-end="1725.31">and google gears and i might add sqlite</span> <span data-start="1725.31" data-end="1729.96">to it performance well in most cases</span> <span data-start="1729.96" data-end="1732.6">when we need a client-side storage we</span> <span data-start="1732.6" data-end="1734.94">have no real choice or performance</span> <span data-start="1734.94" data-end="1736.35">doesn't really matter we just cross our</span> <span data-start="1736.35" data-end="1739.85">fingers and hope that it's fast enough</span> <span data-start="1739.85" data-end="1742.2">thing to keep in mind is that reads are</span> <span data-start="1742.2" data-end="1744.24">important than rights because rights can</span> <span data-start="1744.24" data-end="1746.94">be done in the background but let's look</span> <span data-start="1746.94" data-end="1748.53">at some numbers for local storage yeah</span> <span data-start="1748.53" data-end="1752.66">big big dealer numbers the only thing</span> <span data-start="1752.66" data-end="1755.28">which is important here is that you see</span> <span data-start="1755.28" data-end="1757.62">that Safari these are operations for a</span> <span data-start="1757.62" data-end="1760.38">second that you see that Safari has</span> <span data-start="1760.38" data-end="1763.89">insane numbers it's insanely fast and</span> <span data-start="1763.89" data-end="1766.29">that means when you look at the the top</span> <span data-start="1766.29" data-end="1769.65">row on android 2.2 it beats most of the</span> <span data-start="1769.65" data-end="1773.58">desktop browsers so local storage on a</span> <span data-start="1773.58" data-end="1776.73">mobile device is a really fast storage</span> <span data-start="1776.73" data-end="1780.27">engine it's really really cool and on a</span> <span data-start="1780.27" data-end="1782.34">good smartphone it's available for you</span> <span data-start="1782.34" data-end="1786.21">sqlite reads similarly fast but far</span> <span data-start="1786.21" data-end="1794.25">slower gotta hurry a bit security well</span> <span data-start="1794.25" data-end="1795.57">there is domain based access</span> <span data-start="1795.57" data-end="1797.86">restrictions for all storage engines</span> <span data-start="1797.86" data-end="1802.63">mentioned here of course it's not</span> <span data-start="1802.63" data-end="1806.2">involve all 22 cross-site scripting</span> <span data-start="1806.2" data-end="1809.2">attacks but it's basically it's kind of</span> <span data-start="1809.2" data-end="1811.87">secure except for stuff like DNS poofy</span> <span data-start="1811.87" data-end="1814.87">which you well then you're absolutely</span> <span data-start="1814.87" data-end="1817.51">you can kind of do anything about it the</span> <span data-start="1817.51" data-end="1818.86">only thing that you can think about is</span> <span data-start="1818.86" data-end="1822.97">have client-side encryption like a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1822.97" data-end="1826.87">Blowfish inscripted store but that would</span> <span data-start="1826.87" data-end="1832.25">make your store awfully slow I did that</span> <span data-start="1832.26" data-end="1836.04">and it was like unusable slow because of</span> <span data-start="1836.04" data-end="1838.66">encrypting large amounts of data is well</span> <span data-start="1838.66" data-end="1845.59">slow okay we made it number one client</span> <span data-start="1845.59" data-end="1848.169">side storage is possible it's also</span> <span data-start="1848.169" data-end="1850.54">possible on mobile devices and you never</span> <span data-start="1850.54" data-end="1852.82">have to use cookies again to store</span> <span data-start="1852.82" data-end="1855.429">application settings or anything you</span> <span data-start="1855.429" data-end="1857.88">need to store persistently client site</span> <span data-start="1857.88" data-end="1861.64">we have local storage with which is a</span> <span data-start="1861.64" data-end="1864.13">perfect key value engine and we can do a</span> <span data-start="1864.13" data-end="1866.11">lot of stuff with it and we also have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1866.11" data-end="1868.9">SQLite which is close but also pretty</span> <span data-start="1868.9" data-end="1873.37">cool and future is right we can wait for</span> <span data-start="1873.37" data-end="1876.54">index to be the object store which will</span> <span data-start="1876.54" data-end="1880.12">be maybe the perfect storage solution</span> <span data-start="1880.12" data-end="1882.37">that we've been looking for all the time</span> <span data-start="1882.37" data-end="1886.29">so it's doable and it's getting better</span> <span data-start="1886.29" data-end="1889.929">and we can do it thank you very much</span> <span data-start="1889.929" data-end="1891.79">thanks for listening thanks for having</span> </p>
