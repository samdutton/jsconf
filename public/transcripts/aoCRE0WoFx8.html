data-end="213.889">they need to do is get an encryption</span> <span data-start="213.889" data-end="216.019">secret which means that all right they</span> <span data-start="216.019" data-end="218.629">need to have a unique key per victim if</span> <span data-start="218.629" data-end="220.37">for every infection they need to have a</span> <span data-start="220.37"

so it's important for them to</span> <span data-start="239.12" data-end="241.22">get this unique encryption secret per</span> <span data-start="241.22" data-end="243.65">victim right and then and then they go</span> <span data-start="243.65" data-end="245.959">ahead and start with file encryption so</span> <span data-start="245.959" data-end="247.94">they search for specific file types they</span> <span data-start="247.94" data-end="249.139">don't want to encrypt dll's</span> <span data-start="249.139" data-end="251.69">that doesn't do them any good because</span> <span data-start="251.69" data-end="254.239">you can just restore that but what you</span> <span data-start="254.239" data-end="256.909">cannot restore which is your personal</span> <span data-start="256.909" data-end="259.01">data so if you don't have a backup right</span> <span data-start="259.01" data-end="261.769">so they are looking to encrypt docx</span> <span data-start="261.769" data-end="263.63">xlsx and so that's that sort of thing so</span> <span data-start="263.63" data-end="265.95">you know they they like to</span> <span data-start="265.95" data-end="267.75">finally they

data-end="676.29">diversion screen was all right so then</span> <span data-start="676.29" data-end="678.39">we talked about decrypting the pony</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="678.39" data-end="681.29">Trojan because like I said st dot exe is</span> <span data-start="681.29" data-end="683.88">pertains to the pony trojan that spies</span> <span

data-end="735.27">so this is what it evaluates to and this</span> <span data-start="735.27" data-end="738.63">is what drops the Pony Trojan where it</span> <span data-start="738.63"

data-end="756.42">binary data in string formats so that's</span> <span data-start="756.42" data-end="757.56">what that pertains to you'll see that</span> <span data-start="757.56" data-end="759.51">throughout this ransomware is code and</span> <span data-start="759.51" data-end="763.74">then you see write text safety file</span> <span data-start="763.74" data-end="764.94">close that file</span> <span data-start="764.94" data-end="767.19">so obviously it's creating that file now</span> <span data-start="767.19" data-end="769.77">on in the My Documents folder and then</span> <span data-start="769.77" data-end="771.72">finally it runs the file so now the</span> <span data-start="771.72" data-end="773.61">trojan is executing on your computer</span> <span data-start="773.61" data-end="775.77">next thing it needs to do is now it</span> <span data-start="775.77" data-end="777.99">needs to actually perform its ransomware</span> <span data-start="777.99" data-end="779.61">functionality which is to encrypt drives</span> <span data-start="779.61" data-end="782.55">so to do that what it does is it uses</span> <span data-start="782.55"
