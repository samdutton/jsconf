it was done by some transitions</span> <span data-start="499.34" data-end="502.88">and so on now you don't need to do that</span> <span data-start="502.88" data-end="508.43">you can just use Web Audio for that yeah</span> <span data-start="508.43" data-end="513.68">don't destroy speakers so how its look</span> <span data-start="513.68" data-end="515.57">like again we have any input that's</span> <span data-start="515.57" data-end="519.409">actually a say a sine wave yes and we</span> <span data-start="519.409" data-end="522.2">apply some function to it to make it</span> <span data-start="522.2" data-end="526.79">more square so this mu squared sound</span> <span data-start="526.79" data-end="530.24">gives out our sound to be disordered for</span> <span data-start="530.24" data-end="532.31">example we can apply that function that</span> <span data-start="532.31" data-end="534.86">is here but what's the difference</span> <span data-start="534.86" data-end="539.209">between overdrive distortion and food so</span> <span data-start="539.209" data-end="542.06">the difference is how smooth is that</span> <span data-start="542.06" data-end="546.37">curve overdrive is usually something</span> <span data-start="546.37" data-end="550.27">lamp based so it's more smooth curve</span> <span data-start="550.27" data-end="553.1">distortions have some more harder one</span> <span data-start="553.1" data-end="555.44">and fools basically sounds like</span> <span data-start="555.44" data-end="559.52">something ditional it's almost flat sine</span> <span data-start="559.52" data-end="561.11">wave</span> <span data-start="561.11" data-end="567.51">so to shape our input in way we want it</span> <span
