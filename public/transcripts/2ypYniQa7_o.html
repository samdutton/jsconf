<p><span data-start="26.84" data-end="33.86">Hello, everyone, so my name is Brenna, I'm from Toronto in Canada and I'm a front-end engineer</span> <span data-start="33.86" data-end="39.36">at tent. But before that I actually taught at a Front‑End development boot camp for</span> <span data-start="39.36" data-end="45.67">a year. I want to tell you a little story about something that happened there that came</span> <span data-start="45.67" data-end="51.83">to be known as the "oprah circle" so the very first time we ran this boot camp everything</span> <span data-start="51.83" data-end="57.85">was sort of experiment, we were feeling it out as we went along and we kind of followed</span> <span data-start="57.85" data-end="63.11">the normal course you would started out with a couple weeks over HTML and CSS followed</span> <span data-start="63.11" data-end="69.39">by a few weeks of JavaScript and then something happened in the weeks immediately following</span> <span data-start="69.39" data-end="75.83">JavaScript, there was a weird tension hanging over the entire classroom. We got this feeling</span> <span data-start="75.83" data-end="80.5">that we had like defeated people. And so we decided that we needed to do something, we</span> <span data-start="80.5" data-end="87.43">staged an intervention of sorts. We gathered all of our 27 or so students in a circle,</span> <span data-start="87.43" data-end="92.179">and we asked them all to share a highlight of the course so far, followed by a low light</span> <span data-start="92.179" data-end="96.83">and then another highlight. So the low lights ranged from things you would expect like:</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="96.83" data-end="102.229">I don't get to see my friends and family as much, I have a long commute. Halve of my students</span> <span data-start="102.229" data-end="109.759">gave me a one word answer "javaScript" JavaScript was a low light for them, this broke my heart</span> <span data-start="109.759" data-end="115.95">the JavaScript community is personally where I have felt like the most inspired, the most</span> <span data-start="115.95" data-end="120.009">supported, the most welcome in my own journey as a Front‑End developers and I wanted to</span> <span data-start="120.009" data-end="124.619">know why aren't these people new to the is industry feeling the love, why haven't they</span> <span data-start="124.619" data-end="130.679">seen the good parts of the community. If you think about it, this isn't that surprising,</span> <span data-start="130.679" data-end="136.22">learning to code is a hard challenging thing to do, there are barriers involved. Today</span> <span data-start="136.22" data-end="140.9">I want to talk about those barriers, some of them are technical, some of them are cultural,</span> <span data-start="140.9" data-end="144.19">and I want to talk about the solutions to help overcome them for the newest members</span> <span data-start="144.19" data-end="152.08">of our community. One thing that I think is really critical to remember is that many newcomers</span> <span data-start="152.08" data-end="158.159">to JavaScript are new to the world of programming in a lot of ways. This happens really frequently</span> <span data-start="158.159" data-end="164.04">and increasingly because the demand for JavaScript developers is so high and we have a hugh influx</span> <span data-start="164.04" data-end="168.48">of people that are coming in from non‑traditional backgrounds and looking maybe formal computer</span> <span data-start="168.48" data-end="174.18">science training. I think many of us sort of build up our JavaScript knowledge like</span> <span data-start="174.18" data-end="180.43">this. We're able to get the job done and like ship something out, but in essence we're looking</span> <span data-start="180.43" data-end="186.769">a solid foundation beneath that. One great strategy for dealing with this is just to</span> <span data-start="186.769" data-end="190.969">read a book that covers these fundamental topics, there are a ton of them available</span> <span data-start="190.969" data-end="195.73">on‑line for free. So whether this be for yourself our to recommend to somebody who's</span> <span data-start="195.73" data-end="200.14">kind of struggling building those foundations this is a good resource, eloquent JavaScript</span> <span data-start="200.14" data-end="205.53">in particular, a lot of people said they've had good success with that. And when you're</span> <span data-start="205.53" data-end="211.45">looking these foundations it fundamentally comes down to communication problem. How often</span> <span data-start="211.45" data-end="217.18">do we tell people oh, you have a problem in your code? Just Google it. And while it's</span> <span data-start="217.18" data-end="222.019">true that most of the answers are out there somewhere in the internet, how can somebody</span> <span data-start="222.019" data-end="227.719">formulate an intelligent question and find their way there if they don't use the correct</span> <span data-start="227.719" data-end="233.969">terminology, if they don't speak the language. So, this I found was happening with a lot</span> <span data-start="233.969" data-end="237.81">of my students, we just weren't seeing eye to eye as far as talking about the concepts</span> <span data-start="237.81" data-end="246.01">that we were trying to debug, I used a little technique I call hooked on syntax. So, something</span> <span data-start="246.01" data-end="252.469">like this, pretty simple line of code. Maybe if you are, you know, reasonably profish innocent</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.469" data-end="256.209">JavaScript, you can read that and sort of parse out what it does immediately in your</span> <span data-start="256.209" data-end="262.99">head. But for a beginner, you have to interpret all this. That's a lot that you're doing implicitly.</span> <span data-start="262.99" data-end="268.93">I literally would sit with students and say let's sound this out word by word. Var, what</span> <span data-start="268.93" data-end="274.26">is that, that's a key word that exists in JavaScript and it says hey, I'm going to go</span> <span data-start="274.26" data-end="280.34">create a variable. Max number, what is that? And you know, I know that that's something</span> <span data-start="280.34" data-end="284.52">that I made up, I got to name that, but that's not something that's always clear to a beginner,</span> <span data-start="284.52" data-end="291.12">so you really have to be patient with people as they're going through things like this.</span> <span data-start="291.12" data-end="295.72">And this is actually like a tough thing for me to do as a teacher, like I struggle to</span> <span data-start="295.72" data-end="301.65">be patient. It's so tempting when the someone has a problem, hear's the answer I'll give</span> <span data-start="301.65" data-end="306.65">it to you, but they're never going to learn like that. One thing that infuriates me the</span> <span data-start="306.65" data-end="311.9">most when I see a more experience developer (infuriates) come over to someone's computer</span> <span data-start="311.9" data-end="317.729">and literally take over and type on it. You need to let that person, as painstaking as</span> <span data-start="317.729" data-end="322.919">it might be, type things out really slowly for themselves and actually learn and internalize</span> <span data-start="322.919" data-end="329.36">and make their own mistakes. And returning to this idea of keeping track of a lot of</span> <span data-start="329.36" data-end="335.9">language and syntax and terminology, we really need to remember that this is not a test.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.9" data-end="340.8">We're brought up with this culture of memorization, all throughout like most of our traditional</span> <span data-start="340.8" data-end="345.99">schooling, we learn something and then we're tested on it and usually we just have to memorize</span> <span data-start="345.99" data-end="351.8">the thing that we're being tested on this is not in any way like a typical programmers</span> <span data-start="351.8" data-end="357.889">work flow. Personally, I have the syntax for something like a four memorized because I've</span> <span data-start="357.889" data-end="364.66">written it thousands of times, but I never Satoshi there with flash cards and memorized</span> <span data-start="364.66" data-end="370.759">for a 404 loop is, for some reason people that are entering don't get that, they feel</span> <span data-start="370.759" data-end="375.58">a pressure that they have to memorize it. I want you to tell people it's okay to look</span> <span data-start="375.58" data-end="380.49">it up. There's no shame in looking something up that you don't know (Memorize it) let's</span> <span data-start="380.49" data-end="384.99">provide them with resources to do this. This is just like a quick cheat sheet I through</span> <span data-start="384.99" data-end="390.229">together for some of my students. I could tell that they were just overwhelmed with</span> <span data-start="390.229" data-end="396.8">all of this and it really helped to have that security blanket there, so share these resources</span> <span data-start="396.8" data-end="406.06">with people or create them yourself. Another challenge for a lot of beginners is specially,</span> <span data-start="406.06" data-end="411.52">especially for people coming in from HTML and CSS, that has a lot of immediate feedback</span> <span data-start="411.52" data-end="419.229">and visual output. So JavaScript can be really dry and abstract and boring. One thing, I</span> <span data-start="419.229" data-end="423.55">think we need to to do is stop using Foo and bar, extremely achieving tract things in our</span> <span data-start="423.55" data-end="431.52">example, use something with context that actually means something to someone. You know, if I</span> <span data-start="431.52" data-end="436.22">see black and Orange, I understand that those are both colors and they're related and helps</span> <span data-start="436.22" data-end="443.27">me grasp the con sect that an array is a collection of related items. The thing with this too</span> <span data-start="443.27" data-end="452.37">is it's also memorable. So, who recognizes this? It's a closing brace. Closing parenthesis</span> <span data-start="452.37" data-end="457.55">and a semi colon. It's a familiar pattern that we see at the end of a lot of call back</span> <span data-start="457.55" data-end="464.039">functions and if you're experienced you recognize this. To a beginner you miss one piece of</span> <span data-start="464.039" data-end="471.259">punctuation and everything stops. And you see syntax error on‑line 24, and which one</span> <span data-start="471.259" data-end="479.349">of these is missing. Who knows. How do you get someone to build the memory for that signature,</span> <span data-start="479.349" data-end="484.53">recognize this and know that this is the correct way to to it. You give it a silly nickname.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="484.53" data-end="489.169">If you ask any one of the hundred or so people that taught JavaScript to last year, they</span> <span data-start="489.169" data-end="501.5">will all immediately tell you this is the frownny winky neck beard. (Laughing) (Frownywinkyneckbeard)</span> <span data-start="501.5" data-end="510.949">similarly, dollar signs parens came to be know Q query activate! Because when you have</span> <span data-start="510.949" data-end="515.01">something and you want to be able to use J query methods on it, you need to activate</span> <span data-start="515.01" data-end="521.63">the J query by swadelling it in dollar signs and parens. The moral is to have fun with</span> <span data-start="521.63" data-end="526.31">it. I think you're an incredibly fun bunch of people when I meet you in person, why not</span> <span data-start="526.31" data-end="532.12">bring that liveliness in our on‑line examples and make ourselves more memorable to beginners</span> <span data-start="532.12" data-end="541.69">(Liveliness) so, time for another problem. If you've got your fundamentals down you know</span> <span data-start="541.69" data-end="547.92">the mechanics of how things work. A ton of people really struggle with tackling a larger</span> <span data-start="547.92" data-end="554.34">problem. They say where do I start? It's sort of libelerring to use a saw and a hammer and</span> <span data-start="554.34" data-end="558.59">a tape measure individually. And then all of a sudden someone says build me a bookcase.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="558.59" data-end="564.03">Where do I start with that? And I think this is actually where a lot of online tutorials</span> <span data-start="564.03" data-end="569.75">miss the mark they teach you the mechanics, they don't teach you the art of problem solving.</span> <span data-start="569.75" data-end="575.48">That's a skill, once you're an experienced developer you gain. So, I think we need to</span> <span data-start="575.48" data-end="579.77">teach people to think like a computer. Try and get them to break town a complex problem</span> <span data-start="579.77" data-end="584.51">into dis\h‑‑ break down a complex problem into discreet steps you want to get them writing</span> <span data-start="584.51" data-end="591.08">pseudo code. You're giving them little baby portions to chew off one piece at a time that</span> <span data-start="591.08" data-end="596.88">they can match up with their Toolkit a little easier. And I think we can do stuff in our</span> <span data-start="596.88" data-end="602.02">community to facilitate that and give people an environment where they can take on those</span> <span data-start="602.02" data-end="607.9">bigger problems and have support through working through the stages. This is a picture from</span> <span data-start="607.9" data-end="611.79">note school Toronto T school is a\h‑‑ note school is a fantastic organization in</span> <span data-start="611.79" data-end="617.88">tons over cities easy to start a chapter if there isn't one where you live. Anyone is</span> <span data-start="617.88" data-end="624.12">welcome to come and work through a tutorial or hack on their own projects and it's completely</span> <span data-start="624.12" data-end="629.09">casual and informal but there's support there. There's experienced developers, there's peers</span> <span data-start="629.09" data-end="634.81">to help them through that and sort of learn, you know, that more difficult art of actually</span> <span data-start="634.81" data-end="640.75">working through real world problems that you're solving with JavaScript. What this comes down</span> <span data-start="640.75" data-end="645.82">to in essence even though a lot of these are more technical strategies, is this is about</span> <span data-start="645.82" data-end="650.07">being welcoming to newcomers, just really taking them under your wing and helping them</span> <span data-start="650.07" data-end="654.44">get oriented in what is kind of a strange new world if you've never seen JavaScript</span> <span data-start="654.44" data-end="661.67">before. So, let's assume our foundation is built, we know how to use all our tools and</span> <span data-start="661.67" data-end="672.23">when to use them. You're eventually going to come up against this. it's so great that</span> <span data-start="672.23" data-end="676.58">a lot of us have passion about JavaScript and how to write it, but with all these strong</span> <span data-start="676.58" data-end="682.41">opinions flying around this is what it feels like. People get totally concerned about what's</span> <span data-start="682.41" data-end="688.25">the right way to do it? I've seen it so bad 20 the point (People get totally) people are</span> <span data-start="688.25" data-end="694.84">scared to write town any code because they're afraid to do it the wrong way. Now part of</span> <span data-start="694.84" data-end="702.87">this is JavaScript itself. Our lovely little language has so many instances where there</span> <span data-start="702.87" data-end="708.65">are literally multiple ways to accomplish the same task. This happens on a macro scale</span> <span data-start="708.65" data-end="713.83">as well. I think it's incredibly healthy that we have a rich ecosystem of frameworks and</span> <span data-start="713.83" data-end="718.82">tooling this can get extremely overwhelming when you're faced with all the choices and</span> <span data-start="718.82" data-end="726.27">you're not sure which one you should be using. Beyond this it's really not helpful when we're</span> <span data-start="726.27" data-end="737.52">constanthly critiquing penal for using last year's model. We need to let go the idea of</span> <span data-start="737.52" data-end="743.13">there being one true way to do something. Encourage beginners to pick a method, pick</span> <span data-start="743.13" data-end="748.92">a framework and give it a try. If you don't like it or if it doesn't work for you, then</span> <span data-start="748.92" data-end="754.3">try something new. You know. If it gets the job done, in my opinion, that's the right</span> <span data-start="754.3" data-end="759.86">choice. Let people learn for themselves what the maybe the pitfalls of using something</span> <span data-start="759.86" data-end="768.99">is on their own let them learn their lessons, we think we have done a good job with this</span> <span data-start="768.99" data-end="774.1">paradox of choice is through things like code style guides and best practices, people are</span> <span data-start="774.1" data-end="778.93">really looking for guidance here. I heard this answer over and over and over again that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="778.93" data-end="785.2">I just don't know which thing to do. So, give them guidance. These are great tools to use</span> <span data-start="785.2" data-end="789.84">either if you're learning on your own, someone comes at you with an opinion, no, I did it</span> <span data-start="789.84" data-end="797.27">with this way because the AirBnB Java guide said so, shut that down. Also if you're leading</span> <span data-start="797.27" data-end="802.07">a team where you're managing a bunch of junior developers, implement something like this</span> <span data-start="802.07" data-end="807.02">so you can stop people arguing on your team and get people to writing JavaScript together</span> <span data-start="807.02" data-end="815.91">as a team. If you're outside of these formal places where it's allowed to set the one true</span> <span data-start="815.91" data-end="823.94">way, we all need to bite our damn tongues. This probably happened to a lot of other people</span> <span data-start="823.94" data-end="831.65">in audience, you post a piece of code on‑line, all of a sudden, you have like opinions flying</span> <span data-start="831.65" data-end="839.31">at you about oh, you should do it this way instead, have be you considered that in imstead,</span> <span data-start="839.31" data-end="843.45">why not say something like can I give you a suggestion instead of just flying at someone</span> <span data-start="843.45" data-end="849.18">with the way that you think it's supposed to be done. If you start a conversation like</span> <span data-start="849.18" data-end="853.85">this, you're going to just like open up a dialogue where you can talk constructively</span> <span data-start="853.85" data-end="860.88">about maybe the benefits and draw backs of different options without it being so hostile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="860.88" data-end="866.87">And when you are giving help to someone, b writing a Blog post, GitHub issues stockover</span> <span data-start="866.87" data-end="872.29">flow answer, I think we need to chose our words really wisely. There's a great Blog</span> <span data-start="872.29" data-end="877.51">post by Chris Coyier about words to avoid in Eckcational writing. Educational writing</span> <span data-start="877.51" data-end="886.79">is anything Blog post stackover flow. If you use words like obviously, just, simply, you're</span> <span data-start="886.79" data-end="892.58">implying that the task is easy. But the audience are beginners, it's nota city for them, by</span> <span data-start="892.58" data-end="898.06">using these words you've completely trivialize their struggle. And if you take the words</span> <span data-start="898.06" data-end="905.74">out of the sentence, it reads exactly the same way any way. Just don't do it. What this</span> <span data-start="905.74" data-end="913.3">is empathy really. You need to try and remember what it was like when you were learning, and</span> <span data-start="913.3" data-end="917.11">there's psychology there that the further you get from your beginner stage the more</span> <span data-start="917.11" data-end="922.01">expert you become it's actually just harder to remember what it was like when you were</span> <span data-start="922.01" data-end="926.5">a beginner, but I urge you all to just try before you answer someone who's in a more</span> <span data-start="926.5" data-end="931.91">junior position, take a second and try to see their perspective of where they're coming</span> <span data-start="931.91" data-end="939.63">from. This also applies with documentation. As a rather famous quote from Kathy Sierra,</span> <span data-start="939.63" data-end="947.75">if you want them to RTFM, make a better FM. I literally do not think I've ever heard someone</span> <span data-start="947.75" data-end="954.75">complain about documentation being too easy to understand so why not just make it accessible</span> <span data-start="954.75" data-end="960.04">to everybody. I know it's not everybody's favorite task, but it is so, so critical there's</span> <span data-start="960.04" data-end="966.14">resources to help you write the docks that can help you with this. All of this is the</span> <span data-start="966.14" data-end="971.93">idea of being supportive instead of just critiquing. We quantity to be offering up resources and</span> <span data-start="971.93" data-end="980.28">encouragement. And so I also think we knead to just like to out of our way to be encouraging</span> <span data-start="980.28" data-end="991.42">to other people. (Laughing) (Need) want to take that in a couple more times. You know,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="991.42" data-end="996.14">I think in general humans are faster to offer up' negative opinion than a positive one.</span> <span data-start="996.14" data-end="1001.08">We tend to hold that back. So just be encouraging whether that's in the form of like a high</span> <span data-start="1001.08" data-end="1005.58">five when someone's debugging something and they get it to work, celebrate the is small</span> <span data-start="1005.58" data-end="1008.88">wins, tell somebody if you think they did something great. I'm sure they would love</span> <span data-start="1008.88" data-end="1016.3">to hear it. And sometimes that also means just giving somebody a gentle nudge. Pushing</span> <span data-start="1016.3" data-end="1023.63">them outside of their comfort zone. There are so many people that have done this to</span> <span data-start="1023.63" data-end="1028.089">me when I thought, no, I can't talk at a conference, I don't have anything to say, I don't have</span> <span data-start="1028.089" data-end="1032.809">anything anyone wants to hear, I think Brian summed this up really well this morning. But,</span> <span data-start="1032.809" data-end="1039.75">yeah, try and push people out of their comfort zone and encourage them to take leaps. Okay,</span> <span data-start="1039.75" data-end="1050.25">so, one more big thing I think I need to address. A lot of people feel like this. As they continue</span> <span data-start="1050.25" data-end="1055.009">in their journey they've learned a lot of foundations, they've maybe like been able</span> <span data-start="1055.009" data-end="1059.83">to deal with the negative opinions coming in, but the more you see the industry, I think</span> <span data-start="1059.83" data-end="1066.389">for a lot of people they start to feel leek they don't quite fit in here. So, sometimes</span> <span data-start="1066.389" data-end="1071.539">it's literally I don't look like you. I don't look like a developer, but even regardless</span> <span data-start="1071.539" data-end="1077.279">of that, I think all of us have been fed this false narrative that in order to be successful</span> <span data-start="1077.279" data-end="1085.419">as a developer, as a JavaScripter. You need to devote your entire life to code. You're</span> <span data-start="1085.419" data-end="1089.33">not allowed to have outside hobbies, you'll never get ahead if you're not coding every</span> <span data-start="1089.33" data-end="1098.62">single night. I think this is entirely false. One of my students went through the boot camp,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1098.62" data-end="1106.789">I became friends with her, she got a job with a well known agency. On the books she was</span> <span data-start="1106.789" data-end="1114.69">successful as a web developer. Personally she confided in me she was thinking of quitting.</span> <span data-start="1114.69" data-end="1120.269">She said I'd like to make something with my hands, I want to maybe just go into woodworking</span> <span data-start="1120.269" data-end="1126.909">and do that instead. Instead. To her it was a binary option. She couldn't be a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1126.909" data-end="1133.629">developer and do something like this on the side. And I said, no, no, no, wait it's okay.</span> <span data-start="1133.629" data-end="1141.149">I know developers who are carpenters. Anyone know will more key, he still does it ton side,</span> <span data-start="1141.149" data-end="1146.009">he's done great talks about how that influences his JavaScript work. There are developers</span> <span data-start="1146.009" data-end="1153.44">who are in to perfectly clear ice. (Laughing) and how do I know this? I know this because</span> <span data-start="1153.44" data-end="1158.95">they freely volunteer that information on Twitter publically (Laughing) but I think</span> <span data-start="1158.95" data-end="1164.83">that's great. I think\h‑‑ we should all just not be shy about who we rein our lives</span> <span data-start="1164.83" data-end="1170.11">outside of JavaScript and share your lovely unique selves, because I fundamentally believe</span> <span data-start="1170.11" data-end="1185.09">teach and every one of you is totally awesome. Yeah. Clap for yourselves. (Applause) by having</span> <span data-start="1185.09" data-end="1191.11">unique interests, and knowledge from outside JavaScript or computer science we all bring</span> <span data-start="1191.11" data-end="1195.09">something incredibly unique to the table. And I think we're better off as an industry</span> <span data-start="1195.09" data-end="1200.21">for it. Diverse people are going to look at things in different ways and solve diverse</span> <span data-start="1200.21" data-end="1206.389">problems. And where I think the magic really happens is when we take our interests and</span> <span data-start="1206.389" data-end="1211.97">hobbies and combine them with JavaScript to make truly inspiring things that appeal to</span> <span data-start="1211.97" data-end="1219.57">a much wider audience. General for example loves art, loves pixel art, so she does that</span> <span data-start="1219.57" data-end="1227.2">on‑line, she makes a lot of art with JavaScript. I'm also incredibly inspired by our determination</span> <span data-start="1227.2" data-end="1234.87">to use JavaScript outside the browser. Node happened not to long ago we decided hey, we're</span> <span data-start="1234.87" data-end="1240.919">stuck with JavaScript, I think it's sort of started where all of us were stuck with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1240.919" data-end="1243.919">because it's the only thing that runs in the browser and then this school thing happened</span> <span data-start="1243.919" data-end="1248.659">where we're like we're just going to put it elsewhere and run with it. So we got node</span> <span data-start="1248.659" data-end="1253.7">with JavaScript on the server. And then we got Nodebots with JavaScript running on our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1253.7" data-end="1260.509">Arduino boards and people like Sandra mesh always been into suing since a kid now she</span> <span data-start="1260.509" data-end="1268.159">makes wearables that are controlled by JavaScript. And this idea of JavaScript all the things</span> <span data-start="1268.159" data-end="1274.73">just keeps growing and growing. I never imagined that I'd see JavaScript on a nitting machine,</span> <span data-start="1274.73" data-end="1286.35">but Mariko did this. Hopefully you all saw her talk reject JS. All of these people I</span> <span data-start="1286.35" data-end="1291.71">just showed you and so, so many others that I don't have time to mention have inspired</span> <span data-start="1291.71" data-end="1298.299">me to stick with JavaScript rather than any other language. They've inspired me to continue</span> <span data-start="1298.299" data-end="1303.36">learning when I felt like I knew nothing to work on interesting side projects in my spare</span> <span data-start="1303.36" data-end="1309.149">time when I didn't have the motivation. That's why I'm standing here talking to you today.</span> <span data-start="1309.149" data-end="1314.99">Me, and I think so many other people in this room just really finally felt I have a place</span> <span data-start="1314.99" data-end="1323.48">where I belong. So to me, those are the good parts. We're welcoming in terms of helping</span> <span data-start="1323.48" data-end="1330.37">people build a solid foundation and building communities. We're supportive when we reserve</span> <span data-start="1330.37" data-end="1336.97">judgement and offerer encouragement instead. And we're inspiring by just being cool awesome</span> <span data-start="1336.97" data-end="1343.1">people and making really interesting things with JavaScript all over. But not everybody</span> <span data-start="1343.1" data-end="1347.789">knows this yet. Not everyone has had a chance to come to a conference like this and see</span> <span data-start="1347.789" data-end="1354.159">the good parts. So my call, to all of you, is to take whatever you see as the good parts</span> </p>
