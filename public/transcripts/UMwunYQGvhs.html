data-end="176.67">you'll often declare variables that will</span> <span data-start="176.67" data-end="178.409">be referenced by many elements like your</span> <span data-start="178.409" data-end="182.459">base color or based on size on the root</span> <span data-start="182.459" data-end="184.65">right so we have to scope them to an</span> <span data-start="184.65"

data-end="198.9">right with a custom property or a robot</span> <span data-start="198.9" data-end="200.91">first so to call the value you have to</span> <span data-start="200.91" data-end="203.91">use

data-end="264.129">pre-processors in CSS variables they're</span> <span data-start="264.129" data-end="266.889">like two different entities it's like</span> <span data-start="266.889" data-end="268.24">they live in two completely different</span> <span data-start="268.24" data-end="270.639">worlds first preprocessors they don't</span> <span data-start="270.639" data-end="273.58">run on the browser and they live in a</span> <span data-start="273.58" data-end="275.83">source file on your machine right and</span> <span data-start="275.83" data-end="277.87">the preprocessors replaced variables</span> <span data-start="277.87" data-end="279.729">with static values and they're compiled</span> <span data-start="279.729" data-end="281.949">to CSS and the browser knows nothing</span> <span data-start="281.949" data-end="283.419">about those variables in the variables</span> <span data-start="283.419" data-end="285.37">themselves know nothing about your Dom</span> <span data-start="285.37" data-end="288.669">structure now on the other hand CSS</span> <span data-start="288.669" data-end="292.24">variables are entirely more flexible</span> <span data-start="292.24" data-end="294.19">than preprocessor variables but so when</span> <span data-start="294.19" data-end="296.199">you update the value of a CSS variable</span> <span data-start="296.199" data-end="298.569">about the browser updates it anywhere</span> <span data-start="298.569" data-end="299.53">it's referenced and it does it have</span> <span data-start="299.53" data-end="301">runtime so this makes them incredibly</span> <span data-start="301" data-end="303.58">dynamic and it opens up lots of other</span> <span data-start="303.58" data-end="305.169">interesting possibilities and just</span> <span data-start="305.169" data-end="307.33">replacing colors and font values so</span> <span data-start="307.33" data-end="308.86">let's look at some those for example in</span> <span data-start="308.86" data-end="311.289">fact you can't update the value of a</span> <span data-start="311.289" data-end="312.4">variable</span> <span data-start="312.4" data-end="314.289">from within a meteor query right but you</span> <span data-start="314.289" data-end="316.18">can with CSS variables you can update</span> <span data-start="316.18" data-end="318.37">them live inside media queries so for</span> <span data-start="318.37" data-end="320.289">example we have this gutter variable</span> <span data-start="320.289" data-end="322.63">here and it's initially scoped to the</span> <span data-start="322.63" data-end="324.909">root element and then it's reference</span> <span data-start="324.909" data-end="326.229">within the rule such that need a gutter</span> <span data-start="326.229" data-end="328.36">with far and then you can use media</span> <span data-start="328.36" data-end="330.31">queries to provide these new contacts</span> <span data-start="330.31" data-end="332.289">that redefined the value of the gutter</span> <span data-start="332.289" data-end="333.94">at certain break points so you can see</span> <span data-start="333.94" data-end="336.13">that gutter property the values are</span> <span data-start="336.13" data-end="338.02">updated live at each breakpoint right</span> <span data-start="338.02" data-end="339.819">the values themselves are sort of</span> <span data-start="339.819" data-end="342.58">responsive to that now CSS custom</span> <span data-start="342.58" data-end="345.31">properties or variables they behave like</span> <span data-start="345.31" data-end="346.75">regular property so that means they can</span> <span data-start="346.75" data-end="349.539">inherit cascade and they can be scoped</span> <span data-start="349.539" data-end="352.509">to any selector so here we have the</span> <span data-start="352.509" data-end="354.4">space button class right and users</span> <span data-start="354.4" data-end="356.11">variable

the root</span> <span data-start="361.27" data-end="362.889">scope like we did earlier we can declare</span> <span data-start="362.889" data-end="364.69">it on different selectors like button</span>

data-end="653.42">blend mode properly blends an element</span> <span data-start="653.42" data-end="655.37">with background layer and the background</span> <span data-start="655.37" data-end="655.91">can be an</span> <span data-start="655.91" data-end="659.45">a gradient that can be a color and so</span> <span data-start="659.45" data-end="661.34">for example in this header rule here we</span> <span data-start="661.34" data-end="663.92">are blending a background image with a</span> <span data-start="663.92" data-end="666.17">linear gradient and then we're given it</span> <span data-start="666.17" data-end="667.82">a background blend with a multiply which</span> <span data-start="667.82" data-end="669.53">it's a common value for that</span> <span data-start="669.53"

the</span> <span data-start="683.84" data-end="685.49">background blend mode options are very</span> <span data-start="685.49" data-end="687.71">similar to ones you'd find in Photoshop</span> <span data-start="687.71" data-end="690.26">rides you have screening overlay dark</span> <span data-start="690.26" data-end="692.75">and saturation and a bunch more now</span> <span data-start="692.75" data-end="694.64">mixed blend mode is a little different</span> <span data-start="694.64" data-end="698.54">in that it blends the the content of an</span> </p>

data-end="726.35">area now when I found out that you could</span> <span data-start="726.35" data-end="728.39">blend an image element with a background</span> <span data-start="728.39" data-end="730.52">layer I started using the explained mode</span> <span data-start="730.52" data-end="732.62">to help give my grayscale images some</span> <span data-start="732.62"

or</span> <span data-start="745.88" data-end="747.86">a gradient and then for instance use</span> <span data-start="747.86" data-end="750.74">multiply to just blend it together with</span> <span data-start="750.74" data-end="754.25">the background of its parent and what's</span> <span data-start="754.25" data-end="755.9">cool that great scale images tend to</span> <span data-start="755.9" data-end="757.85">have smaller file sizes than color</span> <span data-start="757.85" data-end="760.07">images so you can take advantage of that</span> <span data-start="760.07" data-end="761.84">in these grayscale images and explain</span> <span data-start="761.84" data-end="763.88">those to apply pretty much any series of</span> <span data-start="763.88" data-end="767.3">colors to your images and you could also</span> <span data-start="767.3" data-end="769.04">do this with SVG right you can use the</span> <span data-start="769.04" data-end="771.62">image element to render a raster

data-start="775.46" data-end="776.99">this way you avoid writing some of that</span> <span data-start="776.99" data-end="779.78">extra CSS that's required to make that</span> <span data-start="779.78" data-end="781.77">image fit inside that if</span> <span data-start="781.77" data-end="786.03">ah and here's another example of explain</span> <span data-start="786.03" data-end="788.13">mode being

well the backdrop filter property</span> <span data-start="825.42" data-end="827.07">lets you add some of those same effects</span> <span data-start="827.07" data-end="829.89">but to the area behind an element right</span> <span data-start="829.89" data-end="832.41">so the way this works it needs at least</span> <span data-start="832.41" data-end="834.24">two elements to work property properly</span> <span data-start="834.24" data-end="837.18">the backdrop filter feature so you need</span> <span data-start="837.18" data-end="839.94">a target element that you apply the</span> <span

<span data-start="858.57" data-end="861.09">any area behind that and see I made this</span> <span data-start="861.09" data-end="864">draggable so yep so that that's the</span> <span data-start="864"
