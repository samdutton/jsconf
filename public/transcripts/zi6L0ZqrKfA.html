we should import the</span> <span data-start="671.04" data-end="675.21">color library then we create an instance</span> <span data-start="675.21" data-end="678.39">of the of color with our brand color

data-end="685.56">hard-coded like here or do like us we</span> <span data-start="685.56" data-end="687.63">load it from the back end and apply it</span> <span data-start="687.63" data-end="689.7">asynchronously at runtime for our entire</span> <span data-start="689.7" data-end="693.21">application then we can simply check if</span> <span data-start="693.21"

data-end="708.3">property tag back to your CSS and in</span> <span data-start="708.3" data-end="710.31">your button component you set the</span> <span data-start="710.31" data-end="712.98">background color with war and a text</span> <span data-start="712.98" data-end="715.31">color to the contrast color like so and</span> <span data-start="715.31" data-end="719.1">automatically updates now there's a</span> <span data-start="719.1" data-end="721.589">bunch of different best use cases here</span> <span data-start="721.589" data-end="725.4">and Mike talked a lot about those but be</span> <span data-start="725.4" data-end="727.17">diligent and use custom variables</span> <span data-start="727.17" data-end="728.16">throughout if you're going for this</span> <span data-start="728.16"

<p><span data-start="760.25" data-end="765.54">Frank color where did that button go so</span> <span data-start="765.54" data-end="767.13">even you can still read the text your</span> <span data-start="767.13" data-end="768.6">mail might not even understand that it</span> <span data-start="768.6" data-end="770.459">is a button at all so the thing that we</span> <span data-start="770.459" data-end="772.5">figure then is well what we would</span> <span data-start="772.5" data-end="774.779">typically do and maybe what if we could</span> <span data-start="774.779" data-end="776.43">have like a darker version of the same</span> <span data-start="776.43" data-end="779.13">color and add an outline so that we will</span> <span data-start="779.13" data-end="780.57">be sure that people

so</span> <span data-start="786.209" data-end="788.58">this problem is a bit more complex right</span> <span data-start="788.58" data-end="791.01">because there's actually two problems</span> <span data-start="791.01" data-end="792.81">here first we need to generate a</span> <span data-start="792.81" data-end="795.27">secondary color now a darker primary</span> <span data-start="795.27" data-end="797.339">color which is as close to a primary</span> <span data-start="797.339" data-end="798.79">color as possible</span> <span data-start="798.79" data-end="800.17">but still validates against our</span> <span data-start="800.17" data-end="801.49">background color which in this case is</span> <span data-start="801.49" data-end="804.25">white and the second problem is that we</span> <span data-start="804.25" data-end="806.38">want to add a conditional border that</span> <span data-start="806.38" data-end="808.69">only gets applied if the primary color</span> <span data-start="808.69" data-end="811.24">is lighter than the current minimum</span> <span data-start="811.24" data-end="814.63">constant ratio how do you do that well</span> <span data-start="814.63" data-end="817.54">remember colors yes again so I told you</span> <span data-start="817.54" data-end="819.55">that it allows you to mix colors and</span> <span data-start="819.55" data-end="822.58">test contrast oh I was supposed to click</span> <span data-start="822.58" data-end="827.38">here yeah so but intuitively if you want</span> <span data-start="827.38" data-end="830.11">to make a darker color in real life this</span> <span data-start="830.11" data-end="831.85">is the first problem if you have a</span> <span data-start="831.85" data-end="833.65">palette with a color that you want to</span> <span data-start="833.65" data-end="835.21">make darker you take a little bit of</span> <span data-start="835.21" data-end="837.67">black and mix that in until you get the</span> <span data-start="837.67" data-end="839.38">desired color there are sort of the</span> <span data-start="839.38" data-end="841.35">thing for that</span> <span data-start="841.35" data-end="844.39">okay so let's try to make a function</span> <span data-start="844.39" data-end="846.31">that can do this for us is that a</span> <span data-start="846.31" data-end="848.2">function get validate the color takes a</span> <span data-start="848.2" data-end="850.39">couple of arguments it takes the color</span> <span data-start="850.39" data-end="853.21">that we want to change in this case our</span> <span data-start="853.21" data-end="855.1">primary color it takes the color that we</span> <span data-start="855.1" data-end="856.78">want to validate against it defaults to</span> <span data-start="856.78" data-end="859.24">white there's the minimum contrast ratio</span> <span data-start="859.24" data-end="861.49">that we want to achieve and it takes a</span> <span data-start="861.49" data-end="865.18">mixing amount mmm this is 0.5 it's quite</span> <span data-start="865.18" data-end="866.74">important that this is cool it's a bit</span> <span data-start="866.74" data-end="869.02">low because imagine the same palette</span> <span data-start="869.02" data-end="870.52">that you had earlier and you take a</span> <span data-start="870.52" data-end="872.53">bucket of black paint and pour it all</span> <span data-start="872.53" data-end="874.24">over the end result is going to be black</span> <span data-start="874.24" data-end="876.61">and you made a mess right so that's not</span> <span data-start="876.61" data-end="877.81">gonna work you have to do it in small</span> <span data-start="877.81" data-end="882.61">baby steps to get a proper color and</span> <span data-start="882.61" data-end="884.02">then of course last you take the mixing</span> <span data-start="884.02" data-end="887.38">color so let's look at the body of this</span> <span data-start="887.38" data-end="890.02">function so first things let's generate</span> <span data-start="890.02" data-end="893.02">a new color using the mix function so if</span> <span data-start="893.02" data-end="895.27">the color to want to change mix and we</span> <span data-start="895.27" data-end="896.65">mixed up with the mixing color and the</span> <span data-start="896.65" data-end="900.73">mixing amount then we check if the new</span> <span data-start="900.73" data-end="903.64">colors contrast towards white is less</span> <span data-start="903.64" data-end="905.83">than a minute constant ratio and if it</span> <span data-start="905.83" data-end="909.07">is we call the function again this time</span> <span data-start="909.07" data-end="910.78">with a new color as the color we want to</span> <span data-start="910.78" data-end="913.09">change and a smaller mixing amounts we</span> <span data-start="913.09" data-end="916.96">just do it very very close until</span> <span data-start="916.96" data-end="919.89">eventually we get a color that validates</span> <span data-start="919.89" data-end="921.86">against white</span> <span data-start="921.86" data-end="924.11">someone engineers serum I think well</span> <span data-start="924.11" data-end="925.31">haven't you made a function that could</span> <span data-start="925.31" data-end="927.38">potentially run forever and the thing is</span> <span data-start="927.38" data-end="930.32">that black will always validate against</span> <span data-start="930.32" data-end="932">white lease for the minimum conscious</span> <span data-start="932" data-end="933.41">ratio there is no chance that this</span> <span data-start="933.41" data-end="934.88">actually running forever you always end</span> <span data-start="934.88" data-end="937.37">up with a color that does validate</span> <span data-start="937.37" data-end="942.38">against white and once we have that we</span> <span data-start="942.38" data-end="943.79">can simply call the function with a</span> <span data-start="943.79" data-end="945.62">primary color and get the primary color</span> <span data-start="945.62" data-end="948.35">darker primary color back and we set</span> <span data-start="948.35" data-end="955.01">that back into our CSS so onto our next</span> <span data-start="955.01" data-end="956.51">problem adding a conditional button</span> <span data-start="956.51"

data-end="965.36">let's tackle that problem first so we</span> <span data-start="965.36" data-end="968.48">create a custom variable custom property</span> <span data-start="968.48"
