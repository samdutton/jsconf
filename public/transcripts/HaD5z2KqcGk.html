data-end="57.46">get into any details about animation I</span> <span data-start="57.46" data-end="58.69">think it's important that we start from</span> <span data-start="58.69" data-end="61.09">the beginning what happens when you</span> <span data-start="61.09" data-end="64.18">visit a website every time you look at a</span> <span data-start="64.18" data-end="66.1">picture or anytime you look at a website</span> <span data-start="66.1" data-end="68.439">at all your eye isn't looking directly</span> <span data-start="68.439" data-end="70.899">at anything your eye is gonna constantly</span> <span data-start="70.899" data-end="73.929">move around an event called saccade and</span> <span data-start="73.929" data-end="75.219">the part of the reason why we do this</span> <span data-start="75.219" data-end="76.899">and these are heat maps of where your</span> <span data-start="76.899" data-end="78.849">eyes are looking part of the reason we</span> <span data-start="78.849" data-end="80.74">do this is to create a spatial awareness</span> <span data-start="80.74" data-end="84.49">of the site or of the thing that we're</span> <span data-start="84.49" data-end="86.74">looking at you do this so that you can</span> <span data-start="86.74" data-end="88.359">kind of understand your surroundings</span> <span data-start="88.359" data-end="90.759">biologically but it works the same way</span> <span data-start="90.759" data-end="94.479">on a website so why is this important</span> <span data-start="94.479" data-end="96.759">like why are we talking about the way</span> <span data-start="96.759" data-end="98.95">that our eyes look around and see these</span> <span data-start="98.95" data-end="101.409">things we already use this information</span> <span data-start="101.409" data-end="103.719">all the time web sites all start to look</span> <span data-start="103.719" data-end="106.06">the same because you get used to like</span> <span data-start="106.06" data-end="108.459">having the CTA on the right and having</span> <span data-start="108.459" data-end="110.079">the big hero image and stuff so people</span> <span data-start="110.079" data-end="111.939">feel comfortable when they come to their</span> <span data-start="111.939"

data-end="118.029">information that you're giving them at</span> <span data-start="118.029" data-end="120.34">once they can kind of already know what</span> <span data-start="120.34" data-end="121.63">they're supposed to be clicking and</span> <span data-start="121.63" data-end="124.749">hitting in order to engage buttons on a</span> <span data-start="124.749" data-end="126.819">website and CTAs become the most</span> <span data-start="126.819" data-end="129.13">powerful thing we tend to like make</span> <span data-start="129.13" data-end="131.319">everything else grey or green or blue</span> <span data-start="131.319" data-end="134.019">and then these like bright orange CTA so</span> <span data-start="134.019" data-end="136.45">that our users know where to click</span> <span data-start="136.45" data-end="137.38">because when they're gay</span> <span data-start="137.38" data-end="139.24">gathering all of that spatial awareness</span> <span data-start="139.24" data-end="141.49">looking around the site they can say Oh</span> <span data-start="141.49" data-end="144.22">aha like that is the piece that I need</span> <span data-start="144.22" data-end="147.49">right there this is also why things like</span> <span data-start="147.49" data-end="149.35">growth hacking happen and people are</span> <span data-start="149.35" data-end="151.48">like okay making the button purple like</span> <span data-start="151.48" data-end="153.73">it make it pop polka dot make it pulse</span> <span data-start="153.73" data-end="158.32">and like developers are like no so</span> <span data-start="158.32" data-end="159.7">that's why that kind of stuff happens</span> <span data-start="159.7" data-end="161.53">that's also why we have all these like</span> <span data-start="161.53" data-end="164.8">user testings to see what will work this</span> <span data-start="164.8" data-end="167.08">way or that way when you're scanning and</span> <span data-start="167.08" data-end="168.85">reading things what actually draws your</span> <span data-start="168.85" data-end="171.64">eye and because of this animation kind</span> <span data-start="171.64" data-end="173.62">of gets a bad rap because when you're</span> <span data-start="173.62" data-end="176.41">scanning an environment and something is</span> <span data-start="176.41" data-end="179.08">moving that is the most powerful thing</span> <span data-start="179.08" data-end="181.63">you are biologically programmed to</span> <span data-start="181.63" data-end="184.39">notice and take note of something that's</span> <span data-start="184.39" data-end="188.77">in motion if you do animation well it</span> <span data-start="188.77" data-end="191.11">can be really really an informative</span> <span data-start="191.11" data-end="193.39">experience and guide your users in a</span> <span data-start="193.39" data-end="195.64">really important way but if you do</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="197.89">animation poorly then it could be</span> <span data-start="197.89" data-end="200.02">irritating and jostling for the user so</span> <span data-start="200.02" data-end="202.51">in light of that let's talk about</span> <span data-start="202.51" data-end="204.67">animation in terms of how you can create</span> <span data-start="204.67" data-end="207.67">spatial awareness 'iz and be responsible</span> <span data-start="207.67" data-end="210.25">for your users and part of the way that</span> <span data-start="210.25" data-end="211.06">we're gonna do that is we're gonna</span> <span data-start="211.06" data-end="214">separate out to ideas and animation one</span> <span data-start="214" data-end="216.28">of them is invisible animation or ui/ux</span> <span data-start="216.28" data-end="218.47">animation and the other is immersive</span> <span data-start="218.47" data-end="220.27">animation so we're gonna speak about</span> <span data-start="220.27" data-end="221.47">those two things totally differently</span> <span data-start="221.47" data-end="223.48">because they're they're in essence</span> <span data-start="223.48" data-end="225.79">totally different ideas when you're</span> <span data-start="225.79" data-end="227.35">talking about invisible animation the</span> <span data-start="227.35" data-end="229.27">whole purpose of it is so that the user</span> <span data-start="229.27" data-end="231.52">is not thinking like oh I just had an</span> <span data-start="231.52" data-end="232.959">animation happen what they're thinking</span> <span data-start="232.959" data-end="235.54">is what it like a cohesive experience I</span> <span data-start="235.54" data-end="237.64">just had when you're doing an immersive</span> <span data-start="237.64" data-end="240.07">animation the whole point is to guide</span> <span data-start="240.07" data-end="243.1">the user through like an entire idea of</span> <span data-start="243.1" data-end="245.23">animation and we'll kind of dig into</span> <span data-start="245.23" data-end="248.08">each one of these things in in a lot of</span> <span data-start="248.08" data-end="249.73">detail but let's start with invisible</span> <span data-start="249.73" data-end="252.91">animation what I mean by that so UX</span> <span data-start="252.91" data-end="255.49">animation and UX choreography kind of</span> <span data-start="255.49" data-end="259">come together in this format so when</span> <span data-start="259" data-end="261.07">we're creating these mental maps a lot</span> <span data-start="261.07" data-end="262.9">of times when we're dealing with stuff</span> <span data-start="262.9" data-end="265.06">on a website the most challenging thing</span> <span data-start="265.06" data-end="267.07">that we have is state right that's</span> <span data-start="267.07" data-end="269.5">something that we work a lot with in</span> <span data-start="269.5" data-end="270.82">terms of like moving over</span> <span data-start="270.82" data-end="273.48">to react to manage state or like</span> <span data-start="273.48" data-end="275.92">understanding state as we manage it in</span> <span data-start="275.92" data-end="278.44">the Dom or understanding how the things</span> <span data-start="278.44" data-end="280.45">change and shift and move as a user</span> <span data-start="280.45" data-end="284.74">engages with our site so when you're</span> <span data-start="284.74" data-end="287.74">when your users are working with your</span> <span data-start="287.74" data-end="289.84">site and they're totally getting into it</span> <span data-start="289.84" data-end="291.16">and they're having this like flow based</span> <span data-start="291.16" data-end="293.08">experience because everything is really</span> <span data-start="293.08" data-end="295.33">really groovy and then all of a sudden</span> <span data-start="295.33" data-end="297.31">you interrupt them with like a modal or</span> <span data-start="297.31" data-end="299.35">something that's kind of just jarring</span> <span data-start="299.35" data-end="301.78">and jostling and doesn't work for your</span> <span data-start="301.78" data-end="304.65">experience it can completely destroy</span> <span data-start="304.65" data-end="307.45">what you've built for them this you</span> <span data-start="307.45" data-end="309.64">spent so much time creating these mental</span> <span data-start="309.64" data-end="311.89">maps for them and spatial awareness for</span> <span data-start="311.89" data-end="313.39">them and then all of a sudden you break</span> <span data-start="313.39" data-end="315.61">it that's bad</span> <span data-start="315.61" data-end="317.53">so we're connecting to different states</span> <span data-start="317.53" data-end="319.87">like we are here so you know a very</span> <span data-start="319.87" data-end="322.48">small example of this would be like the</span> <span data-start="322.48" data-end="324.85">one on the left where things kind of</span> <span data-start="324.85" data-end="326.77">just jump into view and the one on the</span> <span data-start="326.77" data-end="328.51">right where you kind of get a sense of</span> <span data-start="328.51" data-end="330.49">where things are coming from and where</span> <span data-start="330.49" data-end="333.04">they're going in like where the spatial</span> <span data-start="333.04" data-end="338.5">awareness is there so Kathy Sierra has</span> <span data-start="338.5" data-end="340.36">this awesome book called badass making</span> <span data-start="340.36" data-end="342.76">users awesome and a good talk that's</span> <span data-start="342.76" data-end="343.81">associated with it</span> <span data-start="343.81" data-end="345.37">and in it she kind of talks about these</span> <span data-start="345.37" data-end="347.65">cognitive leaks that can develop as we</span> <span data-start="347.65" data-end="350.62">structure our UIs and new X's so if</span> <span data-start="350.62" data-end="352.87">we're looking at something like this you</span> <span data-start="352.87" data-end="355.66">know burners that you might have on your</span> <span data-start="355.66" data-end="357.43">typical stovetop you have a bunch of</span> <span data-start="357.43" data-end="358.69">burners and then you have a bunch of</span> <span data-start="358.69" data-end="360.67">controls for the burners and you can see</span> <span data-start="360.67" data-end="362.8">here like it always takes me a second</span> <span data-start="362.8" data-end="365.02">like wait which knob is for which thing</span> <span data-start="365.02" data-end="367.45">but if you just restructure it a little</span> <span data-start="367.45" data-end="369.67">bit you can see how those cognitive</span> <span data-start="369.67" data-end="372.31">leaks are reduced you all of a sudden</span> <span data-start="372.31" data-end="374.95">just by rearranging those things are</span> <span data-start="374.95" data-end="377.71">giving users much more of a key for how</span>

<p><span data-start="380.17" data-end="383.38">I made this pen to kind of demonstrate</span> <span data-start="383.38" data-end="385.63">this idea so if I have this map marker</span> <span data-start="385.63" data-end="389.92">and I open it and then in that this</span> <span data-start="389.92" data-end="392.59">contact form because actually I should</span> <span data-start="392.59" data-end="394.89">probably turn the brightness up sorry I</span> <span data-start="394.89" data-end="399.31">was on an airplane that contact form</span> <span data-start="399.31" data-end="401.02">becomes the title and then the email</span> <span data-start="401.02" data-end="403.21">gets out of the way and then when I hit</span> <span data-start="403.21" data-end="404.16">the submit button</span> <span data-start="404.16" data-end="406.44">those two things become the loader which</span> <span data-start="406.44" data-end="410.22">then in turn becomes the success well</span> <span data-start="410.22" data-end="411.99">the things go on in the background and</span> <span data-start="411.99" data-end="414.3">then I know what what happened and what</span> <span data-start="414.3" data-end="415.74">is where it's going and where it's</span> <span data-start="415.74" data-end="417.66">coming from now when I close that down</span> <span data-start="417.66" data-end="420.36">it becomes the Mack marker again and if</span> </p>

data-end="1342.47">again if I asked somebody where did that</span> <span data-start="1342.47" data-end="1345.38">go you would say it went down there if</span> <span data-start="1345.38" data-end="1347.66">there's no down there it's a absolutely</span> <span data-start="1347.66" data-end="1350.78">position div but like knowing that they</span> <span data-start="1350.78" data-end="1352.97">know where to get it and they know where</span> <span data-start="1352.97" data-end="1354.86">it went is really helpful for them they</span> <span data-start="1354.86" data-end="1356.57">didn't have to break any kind of spatial</span> <span data-start="1356.57" data-end="1362.18">awareness for that so we can't really</span> <span data-start="1362.18" data-end="1363.62">talk about animation without talking</span> <span data-start="1363.62" data-end="1364.91">about performance performance is really</span> <span data-start="1364.91" data-end="1367.19">important because when things look janky</span> <span data-start="1367.19" data-end="1369.35">and things like stutter across the</span> <span data-start="1369.35" data-end="1370.76">screen even if you have the most</span> <span data-start="1370.76" data-end="1373.07">beautiful animation in the world people</span> <span data-start="1373.07" data-end="1374.93">are going to not feel so great about it</span> <span data-start="1374.93" data-end="1376.94">so one thing that's really important is</span> <span data-start="1376.94" data-end="1379.22">that you're using opacity and transforms</span> <span data-start="1379.22" data-end="1381.5">wherever possible you can do crazy</span> <span data-start="1381.5" data-end="1383.93">amazing stuff with just opacities and</span> <span data-start="1383.93" data-end="1385.85">transforms it's amazing what you can</span> <span data-start="1385.85" data-end="1388.43">accomplish so I know it sounds like two</span> <span data-start="1388.43" data-end="1390.05">properties that doesn't sound like much</span> <span data-start="1390.05" data-end="1392.24">but you can actually accomplish a ton of</span> <span data-start="1392.24" data-end="1394.28">things you should also be thinking about</span> <span data-start="1394.28" data-end="1396.47">hardware acceleration things like this</span> <span data-start="1396.47" data-end="1398.36">translate see hack you can even make a</span> <span data-start="1398.36" data-end="1400.46">mixin for it that you can apply or an</span> <span data-start="1400.46" data-end="1403.61">extend where you can apply it all over</span> <span data-start="1403.61" data-end="1404.96">the code base so you don't sorry write</span> <span data-start="1404.96" data-end="1407.93">it all of the time so let's take a look</span> <span data-start="1407.93" data-end="1410.39">at what that would look like so for this</span> <span data-start="1410.39" data-end="1412.64">pen we've got like a hardware</span> <span data-start="1412.64" data-end="1415.88">accelerated div moving across and a</span> <span data-start="1415.88" data-end="1419.3">control so this is the the like margin</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1419.3" data-end="1421.28">I'm moving things with margins for this</span> <span data-start="1421.28" data-end="1422.57">one and I'm moving things with</span> <span data-start="1422.57" data-end="1424.67">transforms for this one I'm not sure if</span> <span data-start="1424.67" data-end="1426.65">you can see from that screen but on my</span> <span data-start="1426.65" data-end="1428.93">screen the top one is flickering and</span> <span data-start="1428.93" data-end="1431.51">kind of moving across in a really janky</span> <span data-start="1431.51" data-end="1433.58">way well the bottom one is moving very</span> <span data-start="1433.58" data-end="1437.39">very beautifully across now also if you</span> <span data-start="1437.39" data-end="1439.79">look in chrome dev tools and I say</span> <span data-start="1439.79" data-end="1442.13">something like alright let's go to more</span> <span data-start="1442.13" data-end="1445.19">tools and we're gonna go to rendering</span> <span data-start="1445.19" data-end="1447.98">I'm gonna pull this up and I'm gonna say</span> <span data-start="1447.98" data-end="1450.59">paint flashing when you when you use</span> <span data-start="1450.59" data-end="1452.51">paint flashing in the chrome dev tools</span> <span data-start="1452.51" data-end="1454.58">what's gonna be highlighted in that</span> <span data-start="1454.58" data-end="1456.5">green is anything that you're moving</span> <span data-start="1456.5" data-end="1459.17">around whether it's causing repaints so</span> <span data-start="1459.17" data-end="1461.6">you can immediately see anything that's</span> <span data-start="1461.6" data-end="1463.46">on your screen that you're not really</span> <span data-start="1463.46" data-end="1466.04">dealing with correctly so that's a</span> <span data-start="1466.04" data-end="1467.63">really nice visual cue if you're doing</span> <span data-start="1467.63" data-end="1469.7">an audit of a bunch of animations at</span> <span data-start="1469.7"

of</span> <span data-start="1481.67" data-end="1483.29">these things you can read a case study</span> <span data-start="1483.29" data-end="1484.7">about that</span> <span data-start="1484.7" data-end="1486.56">yeah they work with opacity and</span> <span data-start="1486.56" data-end="1488.42">transforms in order to animate some of</span> <span data-start="1488.42" data-end="1490.37">the very simple hover effects that they</span> <span data-start="1490.37" data-end="1494.96">have on their movies so all of that said</span> <span data-start="1494.96" data-end="1496.97">we kind of went into all of these like</span> <span data-start="1496.97" data-end="1499.91">how to really subtly deal with you know</span> <span data-start="1499.91" data-end="1501.98">your spatial awareness and your users</span> <span data-start="1501.98" data-end="1504.17">and getting them from here to there now</span> <span data-start="1504.17" data-end="1506.06">let's kind of break and talk about</span> <span data-start="1506.06" data-end="1508.55">something else and it's similar but</span> <span data-start="1508.55" data-end="1511.25">different in its immersive animation so</span> <span data-start="1511.25" data-end="1513.17">immersive animation would be a little</span> <span data-start="1513.17" data-end="1515.87">bit closer to like if you have a diagram</span> <span

data-end="1526.7">supposed to be an animation or like if</span> <span data-start="1526.7" data-end="1528.5">you think about like the big movie sites</span> <span data-start="1528.5" data-end="1530.51">where they're like the whole idea is</span> <span data-start="1530.51" data-end="1533.57">just like go watch Life of Pi and here</span> <span data-start="1533.57"

data-end="2478.98">looping the green sock G stop looping</span> <span data-start="2478.98" data-end="2481.44">functions outside of react for like the</span> <span data-start="2481.44" data-end="2483.27">clouds and things we had</span> <span data-start="2483.27" data-end="2485.85">requestanimationframe to see if things</span> <span data-start="2485.85" data-end="2488.4">hit each other we had green sock for</span> <span data-start="2488.4" data-end="2490.65">keys app for key press events and those</span> <span data-start="2490.65" data-end="2492.24">key press events are just native key</span> <span data-start="2492.24" data-end="2494.34">press events and then we had a repeating</span> <span data-start="2494.34" data-end="2496.17">callbacks for the tacos and margaritas</span> <span data-start="2496.17" data-end="2499.14">you know your regular repeating taco</span> <span data-start="2499.14" data-end="2502.5">callback and we're just having it go</span> <span data-start="2502.5" data-end="2504.96">again and again so this is like a G SAP</span> <span data-start="2504.96" data-end="2507.39">function where when it finished</span> <span data-start="2507.39" data-end="2509.64">it's gonna pass those parameters again</span> <span data-start="2509.64" data-end="2511.17">so that they can move across the screen</span> <span data-start="2511.17" data-end="2513.42">again and the code is actually pretty</span> <span data-start="2513.42" data-end="2519.66">simple to create a fun game so this is</span> <span data-start="2519.66" data-end="2522.93">smoke with SVG I think I'm showing you</span> <span data-start="2522.93" data-end="2524.76">this because I think people tend to</span> <span data-start="2524.76" data-end="2526.77">think of SVG is only being these like</span> <span data-start="2526.77" data-end="2529.89">linear kind of like platonic shapes and</span> <span data-start="2529.89" data-end="2531.84">that you can't do a lot of like really</span> <span data-start="2531.84" data-end="2534.15">fun and beautiful things with it but</span> <span data-start="2534.15" data-end="2536.43">with things like filters and things like</span> <span data-start="2536.43" data-end="2539.22">gradients you can create really ethereal</span> <span data-start="2539.22" data-end="2543.39">and elemental effects Chris Chris here</span> <span data-start="2543.39" data-end="2545.67">in the audience invented SVG so he's</span> <span data-start="2545.67" data-end="2552.09">making faces at me right now you can</span> <span data-start="2552.09" data-end="2554.04">also make things like candles you can</span> <span data-start="2554.04" data-end="2555.99">make things morph and change you can</span> <span data-start="2555.99" data-end="2558.72">make all sorts of beautiful effects that</span> <span data-start="2558.72" data-end="2561.78">actually look earthly with something</span> <span data-start="2561.78" data-end="2563.4">that is built in math and I think that</span> <span data-start="2563.4" data-end="2566.28">is just super cool so I'm showing you</span> <span data-start="2566.28" data-end="2568.08">all of that to let you know that the web</span> <span data-start="2568.08" data-end="2570.45">has so much potential and we've only hit</span> <span data-start="2570.45" data-end="2572.37">the tip of the iceberg there's so many</span> <span data-start="2572.37" data-end="2573.92">things that we can do without</span> <span data-start="2573.92" data-end="2576.15">sacrificing performance without</span> <span data-start="2576.15" data-end="2578.3">sacrificing engagement without</span> <span data-start="2578.3" data-end="2581.34">sacrificing accessibility in fact making</span> <span data-start="2581.34" data-end="2583.74">accessibility better so even all</span> <span data-start="2583.74" data-end="2585.93">technologies by recombining them and by</span> <span data-start="2585.93" data-end="2587.34">thinking about them in a different way</span> <span data-start="2587.34" data-end="2589.53">and by thinking about our users we can</span> <span data-start="2589.53" data-end="2591.54">actually make the web be performant and</span> <span data-start="2591.54" data-end="2594.33">beautiful I do these web animation</span> <span data-start="2594.33" data-end="2597.57">workshops with Val head we you know go</span> <span data-start="2597.57" data-end="2599.25">around and teach people workshops so if</span> <span data-start="2599.25" data-end="2600.63">you want us to come near you</span> <span data-start="2600.63" data-end="2604.11">you can there's like a thing on our site</span> <span data-start="2604.11" data-end="2606.06">where you can let us know I think we're</span> <span data-start="2606.06" data-end="2607.8">gonna go to San Francisco next year and</span> <span data-start="2607.8" data-end="2610.26">also Europe and stuff so check that out</span> <span data-start="2610.26" data-end="2613.11">and I'm also writing an SVG animation</span> <span data-start="2613.11" data-end="2615.15">book this is not the cover of that book</span> <span data-start="2615.15" data-end="2618.18">this was my friend trolling me I don't</span> <span data-start="2618.18" data-end="2621.27">have the man blog animal I that's not</span> <span data-start="2621.27" data-end="2624.6">even my last name I do have a fancy</span> <span data-start="2624.6" data-end="2627.51">chicken though this the early release</span> <span data-start="2627.51" data-end="2629.04">for this book is coming out in a few</span> <span data-start="2629.04" data-end="2630.99">weeks I think so chapters one through</span> <span data-start="2630.99" data-end="2632.49">six and then the rest will come out</span> <span data-start="2632.49" data-end="2635.79">sometime in March I believe so we'll</span> <span data-start="2635.79" data-end="2637.65">we'll kind of keep going with these</span> </p>
