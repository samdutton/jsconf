<p><span data-start="226.94" data-end="230.659">And the variables are reference in the the program and the data streams through program</span> <span data-start="230.659" data-end="237.01">in parallel and is then outputted to fix els, I'm not going to go deep into the web GL explanation,</span> <span data-start="237.01" data-end="242.989">Steve Whiten has brilliant demos if you want to understand how this stuff works, go look</span> <span data-start="242.989" data-end="243.989">at that.</span> <span data-start="243.989" data-end="252">I want to focus on how to remove all this Kruft between programmer and the GPU.</span> <span data-start="252" data-end="263.11">So, one of the things that GPU can do is massive par hash legaltion\h‑‑ this presentation</span> <span data-start="263.11" data-end="269.51">is running in OneJS because doing a talk about graphics without using your own graphics engine</span> <span data-start="269.51" data-end="272">is kind of lame.</span> <span data-start="272" data-end="280.03">So, the cool thing about the GPU is that you can feed it data and have these little programs</span> <span data-start="280.03" data-end="285.08">do your styling for you, so essentially you par ram tar rise the data and then have the</span> <span data-start="285.08" data-end="290.11">little programs on the GPU do style switches, do style changes, in this case I made a very</span> <span data-start="290.11" data-end="297.38">simple blob of vertex data, the little triangles that go into the GPU, on every one of the</span> <span data-start="297.38" data-end="306.58">triangles is a letter, is a character of a font, and in that big blob of data I encode</span> <span data-start="306.58" data-end="313.51">the XY coordinates, in this case the word color is compute.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="313.51" data-end="320.71">And that means that this whole thing is taking like 0.2 milliseconds of draw time in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="320.71" data-end="325.93">and run entirely on yourBU, there's pretty much nothing going on in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="331.84">This parametertion of styling on to GPU, I think is going to be very, very important</span> <span data-start="331.84" data-end="339.59">and it's going to find it, hopefully a new way to style things on the web that CSS has</span> <span data-start="339.59" data-end="341.67">sorely lacked.</span> <span data-start="341.67" data-end="346.71">So the parialism idea or this picture is trying to illustrate (Parallelism) you have to imagine</span> <span data-start="346.71" data-end="352.18">every fix elhaving a function call that computes the function of the fix el.</span> <span data-start="352.18" data-end="358.021">In that case, the functioncal takes some arguments an X and Y coordinate, exclamation parameter</span> <span data-start="358.021" data-end="366.43">T, and it decides the color of the text or the color of the "I" el, it's same concept.</span> <span data-start="366.43" data-end="374.24">So, we all love of brad vector talks Whoo\h‑‑ that guy's awesome.</span> <span data-start="374.24" data-end="380.69">He had an interesting point about first principles, it was a bit puzzling to me, first principles,</span> <span data-start="380.69" data-end="388.06">what are those things, this time around I try to find my first principles of what I'm</span> <span data-start="388.06" data-end="390.13">trying to build.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="622.76" data-end="630.59">But, fuse them in a way that you can leverage the same syntax whether you're writing a shader</span> <span data-start="630.59" data-end="634.94">or whether you're writing something that run in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="634.94" data-end="643.62">So, by the way, these are syntax shaders, syntax highlighting is kind of lame (Laughs)</span> <span data-start="643.62" data-end="649.05">which means that I actually throw the AST on to theG and you can write little fragments</span> <span data-start="649.05" data-end="650.59">that style your code.</span> </p>
