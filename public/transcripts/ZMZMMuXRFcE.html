are</span> <span data-start="1000.28" data-end="1002.38">available to the accessibility tree and</span> <span data-start="1002.38" data-end="1005.08">so two screen readers so one use of</span> <span

data-end="1027.25">getting to this point but it really does</span> <span data-start="1027.25" data-end="1029.67">have some interesting possibilities</span> <span data-start="1029.67" data-end="1032.86">phase four lastly is probably the most</span> <span data-start="1032.86" data-end="1035.05">complicated of all the phases it's going</span> <span data-start="1035.05" data-end="1036.699">to give us access to all computed</span> <span data-start="1036.699" data-end="1038.29">accessibility properties in the</span> <span data-start="1038.29"

data-end="1049.84">through the accessibility tree in the</span> <span data-start="1049.84" data-end="1052.15">same way that we can walk the Dom now so</span> <span data-start="1052.15" data-end="1054.01">again it's going to open up a lot of</span> <span data-start="1054.01" data-end="1055.93">possibilities for functionality and</span> <span data-start="1055.93" data-end="1058.06">capability but I think they're keeping</span> <span data-start="1058.06" data-end="1060.16">this one till the last phase because it</span> <span data-start="1060.16" data-end="1061.63">is the one that's going to take the most</span> <span data-start="1061.63" data-end="1063.63">discussion the most thinking</span> <span data-start="1063.63" data-end="1066.37">so looking at those things this is how</span> <span data-start="1066.37" data-end="1068.11">we can think about building</span> <span data-start="1068.11" data-end="1070.77">accessibility into our custom elements</span> <span data-start="1070.77" data-end="1073.299">recognizing that if we use autonomous</span> <span data-start="1073.299" data-end="1075.49">custom elements we need to add in the</span> <span data-start="1075.49" data-end="1076.96">accessibility characteristics for</span> <span data-start="1076.96" data-end="1079.96">ourselves and that the AO M in time is</span> <span data-start="1079.96" data-end="1081.82">going to give us a lot more flexibility</span> <span data-start="1081.82" data-end="1085.24">to do that but we can also use custom</span> <span data-start="1085.24" data-end="1087.07">elements in fact the whole web component</span> <span data-start="1087.07" data-end="1089.74">stack to solve accessibility problems as</span> <span data-start="1089.74" data-end="1094.51">well sorry so we can create a speak</span> <span data-start="1094.51" data-end="1097.539">content element for example I use a</span> <span data-start="1097.539" data-end="1099.22">screen reader and one thing I quite</span> <span data-start="1099.22" data-end="1101.71">often do is if I want to look at the</span> <span data-start="1101.71" data-end="1104.32">news I will go and set my screen reader</span> <span data-start="1104.32" data-end="1106.72">reading a news item on the website and</span> <span data-start="1106.72" data-end="1107.74">then I'll go off and make myself a cup</span> <span data-start="1107.74" data-end="1109.33">of tea while I'm still listening to it</span> <span data-start="1109.33" data-end="1110.74">because I don't need to look at the</span> <span data-start="1110.74" data-end="1113.049">screen my screen reader on my headset is</span> <span data-start="1113.049" data-end="1114.88">portable I can just walk around the</span> <span data-start="1114.88" data-end="1116.74">house put the kettle on make the tea and</span> <span data-start="1116.74" data-end="1119.049">still listen to the news story and I've</span> <span data-start="1119.049" data-end="1120.22">often thought this would be a really</span> <span data-start="1120.22" data-end="1122.53">useful thing for everybody to be able to</span> <span data-start="1122.53" data-end="1125.23">do being tied to your chair to your</span> <span data-start="1125.23" data-end="1127.75">computer your laptop is not always the</span> <span data-start="1127.75" data-end="1130.299">ideal experience so perhaps we can use</span> <span data-start="1130.299" data-end="1132.37">custom elements to create a widget that</span> <span data-start="1132.37" data-end="1135.309">will let us have a button on screen that</span> <span data-start="1135.309" data-end="1137.47">will read a designated piece of content</span> <span data-start="1137.47" data-end="1139.84">out loud and it turns out it's</span> <span data-start="1139.84" data-end="1142.84">reasonably easy to achieve we can use</span> <span data-start="1142.84" data-end="1145.9">the HTML template element to set up the</span> <span data-start="1145.9" data-end="1148.36">actual element we'll chuck some styling</span> <span data-start="1148.36" data-end="1150.28">in there just to make the the button and</span> <span data-start="1150.28" data-end="1154.75">the div look good we will also use some</span> <span data-start="1154.75" data-end="1159.61">slots to manage things so in the</span> <span data-start="1159.61" data-end="1161.32">template we've got a button element that</span> <span data-start="1161.32" data-end="1163.78">contains a slot element and this will</span> <span data-start="1163.78" data-end="1165.34">let us pull through content from the</span> <span data-start="1165.34" data-end="1167.049">light Dom from the the developer code</span> <span data-start="1167.049" data-end="1170.5">and we'll also set up a div that's also</span> <span data-start="1170.5" data-end="1172.299">going to be a slot for the content that</span> <span data-start="1172.299" data-end="1174.85">we want to be spoken out loud</span> <span data-start="1174.85" data-end="1177.85">in our connected callback we will do all</span> <span data-start="1177.85" data-end="1180.909">sorts of things we will grab the control</span> <span data-start="1180.909" data-end="1182.409">the thing we'll hit to make it speak</span> <span data-start="1182.409" data-end="1185.2">we'll grab the element that contains the</span> <span data-start="1185.2" data-end="1186.909">content and then from there we'll grab</span> <span data-start="1186.909" data-end="1188.62">the content that we want to be spoken</span> <span data-start="1188.62" data-end="1192.82">out loud in our function we will set up</span> <span data-start="1192.82" data-end="1196.059">the web speech API to make it talk we'll</span> <span data-start="1196.059" data-end="1196.96">create</span> <span data-start="1196.96" data-end="1200.049">since this is object and

light</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1203.529" data-end="1206.32">Dom and then lastly we need to set a</span> <span data-start="1206.32" data-end="1208.75">timeout because what we want to do is</span> <span data-start="1208.75" data-end="1211">lastly make the button look like it's</span> <span data-start="1211" data-end="1212.98">been pressed for as long as the contents</span> <span data-start="1212.98" data-end="1215.049">being spoken and then we want to return</span> <span data-start="1215.049" data-end="1217.36">it to its default States when it's</span> <span data-start="1217.36" data-end="1219.279">finished we're using the aria-pressed</span> <span data-start="1219.279" data-end="1221.02">attribute again to make sure that that</span> <span data-start="1221.02" data-end="1223.09">happens in the accessibility state as</span> <span data-start="1223.09" data-end="1225.94">well as the visual state reset state</span> <span data-start="1225.94" data-end="1229.87">then just checks after 500 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="1229.87" data-end="1231.909">and it checks to see if the speech uh</span> <span data-start="1231.909" data-end="1234.64">pterence is still talking if it is still</span> <span data-start="1234.64" data-end="1236.47">talking it resets the timer for another</span> <span data-start="1236.47" data-end="1239.35">500 if it isn't then it returns the</span> <span data-start="1239.35" data-end="1242.07">state of the button back to non pressed</span> <span data-start="1242.07" data-end="1244.75">would you one last bit of under the hood</span> <span data-start="1244.75" data-end="1246.88">magic and we're going to attach the</span> <span data-start="1246.88" data-end="1249.52">visual state of the button to the</span> <span data-start="1249.52" data-end="1252.25">attribute selector using aria-pressed so</span> <span data-start="1252.25" data-end="1254.44">as the value of aria-pressed is changed</span> <span data-start="1254.44" data-end="1256.809">the visual style of the button changes</span> <span data-start="1256.809" data-end="1258.52">accordingly and it just makes the whole</span> <span data-start="1258.52" data-end="1260.62">thing sync up a lot more easily under</span> <span data-start="1260.62" data-end="1262.72">the hood and what we get at the end of</span> <span data-start="1262.72" data-end="1264.85">it is a very simple piece of text on</span> <span data-start="1264.85"
