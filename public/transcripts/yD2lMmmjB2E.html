data-end="255.09">continue having our code bases live for</span> <span data-start="255.09" data-end="259.65">long periods of time my main objection</span> <span data-start="259.65" data-end="262.109">to using frameworks is actually it's</span> <span data-start="262.109" data-end="263.729">more just investment in something which</span> <span data-start="263.729" data-end="267.75">is going to go away quickly so after</span> <span data-start="267.75" data-end="270.21">every 18 months I felt like now I don't</span> <span data-start="270.21"

you know a new of every 18 months</span> <span data-start="276.9" data-end="280.77">so my solution that the solution that I</span> <span data-start="280.77" data-end="282.09">presented was rather than

often</span> <span data-start="334.319" data-end="337.889">will pull tools out of NPM and use them</span> <span data-start="337.889" data-end="339.449">in our projects to solve various</span> <span
