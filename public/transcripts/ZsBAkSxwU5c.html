<p><span data-start="43.28" data-end="48.949">I come from a country where a data plan for 2 gigabytes a month costs 55 Euros and only</span> <span data-start="48.949" data-end="54.5">works in my hometown.</span> <span data-start="54.5" data-end="59.34">Three quarters of a million people are using dialup Internet in their homes.</span> <span data-start="59.34" data-end="60.78">I come from Canada.</span> <span data-start="60.78" data-end="67.1">So, the Internet is so, so expensive just when I'm at home, that when I'm traveling</span> <span data-start="67.1" data-end="71.94">somewhere, to come to Berlin, the prices are out my price range.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.94" data-end="76.86">I like to travel, this data is an issue.</span> <span data-start="76.86" data-end="81">When I travel, I love to visit Paris and the streets look like this.</span> <span data-start="81" data-end="83.82">I get lost really easily in a grid like structure.</span> <span data-start="83.82" data-end="87.72">When I'm over here, I need data to get around.</span> <span data-start="87.72" data-end="91.76">And I could technically download a map offline and use that.</span> <span data-start="91.76" data-end="94.97">But that doesn't give me transit directions which is something I really need when I walk</span> <span data-start="94.97" data-end="96.06">an hour in the wrong direction.</span> <span data-start="96.06" data-end="97.72">I need a subway to get back home.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="97.72" data-end="103.31">When I was trying to come up with a solution for this problem, I noticed like I can't afford</span> <span data-start="103.31" data-end="104.31">the data plans.</span> <span data-start="104.31" data-end="108.399">But SMS without a data plan costs about 15 cents per message.</span> <span data-start="108.399" data-end="109.85">I tried to work around that.</span> <span data-start="109.85" data-end="118.11">When I was starting a solution to this problem, chatbots were the big thing at the time.</span> <span data-start="118.11" data-end="123.9">I set up this problem, setting up a Python server with SMS and grabbing it from the Internet</span> <span data-start="123.9" data-end="128.619">and grabbing the directions and text it back to me.</span> <span data-start="128.619" data-end="133.97">I could do something simple, how do I get from point A to B and get the Google Map directions</span> <span data-start="133.97" data-end="135.12">back in one SMS.</span> <span data-start="135.12" data-end="138.34">I could do this for 30 cents per direction.</span> <span data-start="138.34" data-end="141.84">Which is pretty good compared to what I would be paying for data otherwise.</span> <span data-start="141.84" data-end="146.09">And this really worked, and I used it lot when I was traveling.</span> <span data-start="146.09" data-end="150.53">But the issue is when you get a little bit of access to the Internet, you start to crave</span> <span data-start="150.53" data-end="151.76">it quite a bit more.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.76" data-end="157.68">So, I was building these one off integrations to figure out ratings for a restaurant I wanted</span> <span data-start="157.68" data-end="161.04">to see or a translated word I didn't know and do all this stuff.</span> <span data-start="161.04" data-end="166.159">And building out all these integrations as a one off took up a lot of time.</span> <span data-start="166.159" data-end="167.73">I thought, there must be a better way.</span> <span data-start="167.73" data-end="169.55">I'll just build a browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.55" data-end="172.47">And that's what I'm gonna show you today.</span> <span data-start="172.47" data-end="175.269">So, your two main components to the project I did.</span> <span data-start="175.269" data-end="180.3">There's the Android app on one side and the server in NodeJS on the other.</span> <span data-start="180.3" data-end="183.95">The app I made in Android because I was it just for me.</span> <span data-start="183.95" data-end="185.39">I don't have an iPhone.</span> <span data-start="185.39" data-end="186.9">I didn't care about iOS.</span> <span data-start="186.9" data-end="193">And I'm using Java instead of Kotlin because there was a lot more on StackOverflow on SMS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193" data-end="196.459">That was a good solution for me, I'm not an app developer.</span> <span data-start="196.459" data-end="202.47">And NodeJS, I thought it would be fun you to use JavaScript on a browser where it doesn't</span> <span data-start="202.47" data-end="207.79">belong to make this JavaScript less browser.</span> <span data-start="207.79" data-end="210.65">And then Twilio for the communication.</span> <span data-start="210.65" data-end="218.989">And Twilio does a lot of things, I bought a phone number from it and it let me set up</span> <span data-start="218.989" data-end="221.33">an end point to forward all any SMS to.</span> <span data-start="221.33" data-end="225.55">I can send a text message to my Twilio phone number and it will forward all those messages</span> <span data-start="225.55" data-end="226.65">to my server.</span> <span data-start="226.65" data-end="233.269">So, before I jump into the project, just to set up like a limitation I had to deal with,</span> <span data-start="233.269" data-end="237.209">SMS can only handle 160 characters at a time.</span> <span data-start="237.209" data-end="242.15">If I want to create a browser, I'm going to have to transmit this data less than one Tweet</span> <span data-start="242.15" data-end="243.83">at a time.</span> <span data-start="243.83" data-end="247.37">So, for more context on the issue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="247.37" data-end="250.769">Like this Google web page looks very, very small.</span> <span data-start="250.769" data-end="253.579">It's just a text box and the logo and a button.</span> <span data-start="253.579" data-end="258.44">But the thing is, if you actually look at the page source, not including any CSS, not</span> <span data-start="258.44" data-end="263.222">including the images or any sources being loaded in, this web page is a quarter of a</span> <span data-start="263.222" data-end="264.4">million characters long.</span> <span data-start="264.4" data-end="270.94">If you were to transmit this entire thing, 1300 SMS, not including the ones dropped along</span> <span data-start="270.94" data-end="271.94">the way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.94" data-end="276.84">In Twilio fees alone, I would have been paying $10 to transmit this Google page.</span> <span data-start="276.84" data-end="280.55">It defeats the purpose of being a cheap solution.</span> <span data-start="280.55" data-end="285.86">So, we have to do a lot on this page to get it to work.</span> <span data-start="285.86" data-end="289.73">But if we were to imagine what this Google page look would like building it up from scratch,</span> <span data-start="289.73" data-end="293.85">we wouldn't imagine all the CSS to make it load.</span> <span data-start="293.85" data-end="299.95">We would imagine this little bit of HTML that sets up the form and the text box which is</span> <span data-start="299.95" data-end="303.54">with a we need and takes one SMS.</span> <span data-start="303.54" data-end="308.87">This is how we envision a lot of the web pages to make this project work.</span> <span data-start="308.87" data-end="315.1">So, we're going to walk through the life cycle of a request and that's starting on the Android</span> <span data-start="315.1" data-end="316.67">side in the app.</span> <span data-start="316.67" data-end="323.35">Right off the bat we get into this huge limitation with systems because the URL spec says that</span> <span data-start="323.35" data-end="326.21">a URL can be 2,000 characters longitudinal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="326.21" data-end="331.77">So, that could take up 13 SMS which is a lot more than we want to deal with.</span> <span data-start="331.77" data-end="337.46">The first thing on the app side, and the app looks like this, a text box and a go button.</span> <span data-start="337.46" data-end="339.03">Very simple browser.</span> <span data-start="339.03" data-end="343.56">We're going to start off by chopping off everything that we don't really need.</span> <span data-start="343.56" data-end="347.35">So, the browser is going to be a very text based browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="347.35" data-end="351.66">We're not going to allow any kind of cool single page applications.</span> <span data-start="351.66" data-end="356.07">We can chop off anything that has a pound symbol, page, whatever.</span> <span data-start="356.07" data-end="360.79">We don't want any tracking IDs or query parameters.</span> <span data-start="360.79" data-end="364.15">Everything in black after the URL there we can get rid of.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.15" data-end="369.14">And same with the HTTPS, www, at the start of the URL because it's assumed that all websites</span> <span data-start="369.14" data-end="370.38">have that anyway.</span> <span data-start="370.38" data-end="376.79">So, the part in yellow is what we're going to be sending over as an SMS.</span> <span data-start="376.79" data-end="378.6">And that's gonna look something like this.</span> <span data-start="378.6" data-end="382.84">I'm not going to cover the Android side of things too much.</span> <span data-start="382.84" data-end="389.89">But make sure we have send, receive and write permissions on Android and use their simple</span> <span data-start="389.89" data-end="395">SMS manager API which lets you just specify the destination phone number which in this</span> <span data-start="395" data-end="397.22">case is our Twilio one.</span> <span data-start="397.22" data-end="401.11">Specify the text that you want to send and then it just gets sent off.</span> <span data-start="401.11" data-end="409.11">So, then Twilio picks up on message and converts it into a format that the server will read.</span> <span data-start="409.11" data-end="410.84">It comes with a bunch of metadata.</span> <span data-start="410.84" data-end="416.3">We're only going to care about the body, who it's to and from so we know who to send this</span> <span data-start="416.3" data-end="418.21">message back to.</span> <span data-start="418.21" data-end="422.38">So, this message gets sent over to the server.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="422.38" data-end="424.09">Which we're gonna look at next.</span> <span data-start="424.09" data-end="429.83">So, a lot of us probably working in React or some kind of like componentizing library</span> <span data-start="429.83" data-end="431.32">or framework all day.</span> <span data-start="431.32" data-end="435.27">So, we kind of forget how big our HTML ends up really being because we're only dealing</span> <span data-start="435.27" data-end="437.52">with these little tiny components at once.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="437.52" data-end="442.58">If like me and page source accidently instead of inspect element all the time you end up</span> <span data-start="442.58" data-end="444.07">with a massive wall of text.</span> <span data-start="444.07" data-end="448.01">And how on Earth are web pages this big?</span> <span data-start="448.01" data-end="452.15">This is what the Google source page looks like.</span> <span data-start="452.15" data-end="457.06">This is what we're going to have to deal with and parse before sending it back over for</span> <span data-start="457.06" data-end="458.47">a text.</span> <span data-start="458.47" data-end="461.41">But there are a lot of things that we can remove from this off the bat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.41" data-end="464.71">We don't care about comments, we don't care about header data.</span> <span data-start="464.71" data-end="467.32">We don't care about CSS or any that have stuff.</span> <span data-start="467.32" data-end="473.34">So, there's a lot of stuff we can take off pretty easily to get this to work.</span> <span data-start="473.34" data-end="478.88">On the server side, what we're gonna do is start by grabbing the URL that Twilio sent</span> <span data-start="478.88" data-end="485.15">us, making a request to that URL by pre penning the HTTPS to it and then use a library called</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.15" data-end="488.75">Cheerios which is jQuery for the server side pretty much.</span> <span data-start="488.75" data-end="496.91">And use that to get the body off of the HTML because jQuery makes that quite easy.</span> <span data-start="496.91" data-end="501.96">And then once we have this body, we're going to start to remove a bunch of the HTML.</span> <span data-start="501.96" data-end="505.21">For that, I used a library, sanitize HTML.</span> <span data-start="505.21" data-end="511.52">So, line four that I highlighted lets you specify specific tags in the HTML that you</span> <span data-start="511.52" data-end="512.55">want to allow.</span> <span data-start="512.55" data-end="517.69">So, here we're only going to allow anchor tags, inputs and forms.</span> <span data-start="517.69" data-end="522.451">Those are the only elements in my opinion that really provide any kind of value to the</span> <span data-start="522.451" data-end="524.7">user in a text based browser.</span> <span data-start="524.7" data-end="530.11">Lines 7 10 highlighted shows the specific attributes on those tags that we are gonna</span> <span data-start="530.11" data-end="531.11">allow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="531.11" data-end="535.05">So, we're not gonna allow class name because we don't have CSS anyway.</span> <span data-start="535.05" data-end="539">We're not gonna allow image tags because we can't really load images over SMS.</span> <span data-start="539" data-end="542.58">And we're going to start loading these things.</span> <span data-start="542.58" data-end="545.04">The last bit that's highlighted in the exclusive filter.</span> <span data-start="545.04" data-end="551.24">So, sanitize HTML lets us specify a function of the tags and attributes to decide whether</span> <span data-start="551.24" data-end="552.76">we want to show certain things.</span> <span data-start="552.76" data-end="559.05">So, one of the examples I have there is we're going to get rid of all of the hidden inputs</span> <span data-start="559.05" data-end="562.35">because the user can't see those anyways so it's not going to provide any value.</span> <span data-start="562.35" data-end="565.53">And we're gonna get rid of policy URLs and terms and conditions.</span> <span data-start="565.53" data-end="570.24">No one is going to click on those anyway so it's kind of wasted space.</span> <span data-start="570.24" data-end="575.65">Now we have essentially a whole bunch of text and a couple of tags left in the HTML.</span> <span data-start="575.65" data-end="578.32">We're going to start to compress this text.</span> <span data-start="578.32" data-end="581.77">And we could use something like Gzip.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.77" data-end="584.17">But that's not fun.</span> <span data-start="584.17" data-end="588.02">So, we're gonna forget about any kind of real compression.</span> <span data-start="588.02" data-end="593.13">So, in the English language there are a lot of words that we use super often like the</span> <span data-start="593.13" data-end="594.13">and.</span> <span data-start="594.13" data-end="605.9">And a lot of single letters that are words, I and A. And any common English word can be</span> <span data-start="605.9" data-end="613.34">mapped to a single later that's not a word, everything that's the becomes T, and becomes</span> <span data-start="613.34" data-end="615.43">ampersand or whatever letter.</span> <span data-start="615.43" data-end="621.87">And on Android side, doing the decompression, we know if that letter is there on its own,</span> <span data-start="621.87" data-end="627.17">it means the because it's not a word otherwise.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="627.17" data-end="629.22">And to do that, it's very, very simple.</span> <span data-start="629.22" data-end="633.65">We have to set up a dictionary mapping these words to their shorter versions and then go</span> <span data-start="633.65" data-end="637.8">through the text and do a replace all.</span> <span data-start="637.8" data-end="641.97">Another way of compressing the text is through the source APIs.</span> <span data-start="641.97" data-end="647.68">So, if we're visiting a website like Wikipedia, there are going to be a lot of big words that</span> <span data-start="647.68" data-end="648.91">don't need to be that big.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="648.91" data-end="653.69">So, what we can do is find those very large words, use a thesaurus API and see if there's</span> <span data-start="653.69" data-end="656.53">a matching synonym that's much shorter.</span> <span data-start="656.53" data-end="667.23">Pen ten chair is many letters and jail is a four letter word, we don't care about the</span> <span data-start="667.23" data-end="669.23">word, do a replacement.</span> <span data-start="669.23" data-end="674.09">This is a 66% compression which is quite a good compression rate.</span> <span data-start="674.09" data-end="685.4">The last way we're going to compress the text in our HTML is by replacing links.</span> <span data-start="685.4" data-end="692.21">So, when you're using a website on your phone, you don't care what a link actually is.</span> <span data-start="692.21" data-end="695.8">You just care that it takes you to where it's supposed to take you.</span> <span data-start="695.8" data-end="697.55">The links can be really, really long.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="697.55" data-end="699.16">Like up to 2,000 characters.</span> <span data-start="699.16" data-end="703.59">So, instead of sending over these links that no one is actually going to be reading, we're</span> <span data-start="703.59" data-end="707.02">gonna replace them with really short, random strings.</span> <span data-start="707.02" data-end="712.79">So, when a user clicks on a link on the app side, that short link is what's gonna be sent</span> <span data-start="712.79" data-end="713.99">back to the server.</span> <span data-start="713.99" data-end="718.27">The server's gonna know that short link means that long link and it's gonna fetch the correct</span> <span data-start="718.27" data-end="720.71">data to send back to us.</span> <span data-start="720.71" data-end="722.75">And that's gonna look like this.</span> <span data-start="722.75" data-end="729.39">I'm using Reddit to store the pairings of short to long URLs because we don't need anything</span> <span data-start="729.39" data-end="731.12">super persistent.</span> <span data-start="731.12" data-end="734.89">Most links are not going to be clicked on anyway and the web page is probably going</span> <span data-start="734.89" data-end="736.35">to be gone in five minutes.</span> <span data-start="736.35" data-end="742.38">What we're doing here is there's a function that takes the phone number from the user</span> <span data-start="742.38" data-end="747.99">and the actual URL that is in the web page and it's going to store it in Redis where</span> <span data-start="747.99" data-end="751.89">the key is the phone number and the short URL so it's really easy to retrieve when it's</span> <span data-start="751.89" data-end="752.89">sent back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.89" data-end="755.58">And then the value of that is the full URL.</span> <span data-start="755.58" data-end="761.57">Now, the last bit of compression we're going to do is on the HTML itself.</span> <span data-start="761.57" data-end="765.96">So, we've compressed all the English text, we've compressed the tags and attributes.</span> <span data-start="765.96" data-end="769.81">But we still have going to have a lot of large tags like this.</span> <span data-start="769.81" data-end="774.06">And things like input or type and name and value and all those tags that we do allow</span> <span data-start="774.06" data-end="776.39">are going to show up pretty often.</span> <span data-start="776.39" data-end="779.39">So, we can remove those and replace them.</span> <span data-start="779.39" data-end="784.89">A nice thing about the SMS characters is that it supports all of the English or all of the</span> <span data-start="784.89" data-end="790.64">English or letters and numbers and things that you see on an English keyboard plus the</span> <span data-start="790.64" data-end="791.64">whole Greek alphabet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="791.64" data-end="796.57">So, what we've done here since all the individual letters are already used by our English compression,</span> <span data-start="796.57" data-end="801.52">the text compression, we're going to start mapping specific HTML tags and combinations</span> <span data-start="801.52" data-end="804">of symbols to these Greek letters.</span> <span data-start="804" data-end="808.98">I tried to map it by color here, the open bracket input matches the first character,</span> <span data-start="808.98" data-end="813.16">type equals open quotation mark is the second character.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="813.16" data-end="814.16">So on.</span> <span data-start="814.16" data-end="819.49">This brings it down from 44 characters to 12 characters which is going to provide a</span> <span data-start="819.49" data-end="821.19">significant compression.</span> <span data-start="821.19" data-end="826.22">So, now the HTML is ready to be sent out.</span> <span data-start="826.22" data-end="831.27">But an annoying thing about SMS is that there's no guarantee of delivery and there's no guarantee</span> <span data-start="831.27" data-end="833.72">that it's gonna be delivered in the right order either.</span> <span data-start="833.72" data-end="838.49">So, you might end up with a situation where we've sent out six SMS, but only four of them</span> <span data-start="838.49" data-end="840.74">get there and they're all out of order.</span> <span data-start="840.74" data-end="845.46">We're not going to really care about the part where the SMS are dropped in this project</span> <span data-start="845.46" data-end="850.61">because it's just a small project for me to access the Internet for fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="850.61" data-end="854.73">And if we did worry about that, we would have to build out an entire pact delivery network</span> <span data-start="854.73" data-end="859.18">where you have to figure out which messages were dropped, how to recover from that and</span> <span data-start="859.18" data-end="861.18">that's just a little bit more effort.</span> <span data-start="861.18" data-end="865.32">But we are going to worry about this out of order problem.</span> <span data-start="865.32" data-end="871.181">And to solve that, the HTML that we have is going to be divided up into the 160 character</span> <span data-start="871.181" data-end="872.41">limit.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="872.41" data-end="877.92">And we're going to pre pen some metadata to the start of each message that shows the total</span> <span data-start="877.92" data-end="883">number of messages in this web page and then the index where that SMS falls so that when</span> <span data-start="883" data-end="888">we put the HTML back together it's in the correct order.</span> <span data-start="888" data-end="891.91">And to send out those messages, we're just going use Twilio's library.</span> <span data-start="891.91" data-end="895.35">Very simple, Twilio, send message.</span> <span data-start="895.35" data-end="897.88">And it goes off and that's all I have to do.</span> <span data-start="897.88" data-end="903.13">Now the messages are sent and we're ready to start getting them again on the Android</span> <span data-start="903.13" data-end="904.13">side.</span> <span data-start="904.13" data-end="911.22">So, Android has a thing called a broadcast receiver which is something that listens out</span> <span data-start="911.22" data-end="913.53">for certain signals that are sent within your phone.</span> <span data-start="913.53" data-end="919.17">So, here we have set up a broadcast receiver that listens out for messages coming in specifically</span> <span data-start="919.17" data-end="922.62">from the number that we own on Twilio.</span> <span data-start="922.62" data-end="926.62">So, what this is doing is it's just listening for that message to come in.</span> <span data-start="926.62" data-end="931.24">And then it's grabbing the text from that message and sending it other to an activity</span> <span data-start="931.24" data-end="934.49">which is Android's way of saying a new you.</span> <span data-start="934.49" data-end="939.41">And in that new view, the first thing we're going to have to do is reverse that Greek</span> <span data-start="939.41" data-end="943.19">letter conversion that we did to get the proper HTML back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="943.19" data-end="945.85">We're going to reverse the shortened English words.</span> <span data-start="945.85" data-end="949.81">We're going to add some spaces between closing and opening tags so there's a little bit of</span> <span data-start="949.81" data-end="951.27">format in our page.</span> <span data-start="951.27" data-end="953.91">There's no CSS to make it look good.</span> <span data-start="953.91" data-end="956.15">We're going to try to break it up a little bit.</span> <span data-start="956.15" data-end="958.2">And then we're going to load the HTML.</span> <span data-start="958.2" data-end="963.44">So, Android has my favorite feature ever which is called a web view.</span> <span data-start="963.44" data-end="969.3">And web view is something that lets you have a like a little version of Chrome within your</span> <span data-start="969.3" data-end="970.3">app.</span> <span data-start="970.3" data-end="973.48">And this was the most exciting feature for me because going into this project I didn't</span> <span data-start="973.48" data-end="977.74">know that you could pass a web view in actual HTML string, I thought you could only pass</span> <span data-start="977.74" data-end="979.95">a URL to load.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="979.95" data-end="985.37">I thought I would have to build my own browser and rendering engine and that didn't sound</span> <span data-start="985.37" data-end="987.35">like tons of fun.</span> <span data-start="987.35" data-end="988.93">This takes care of everything.</span> <span data-start="988.93" data-end="992.36">Chrome is just going render everything properly for us.</span> <span data-start="992.36" data-end="995.399">And this is what it ends up looking like.</span> <span data-start="995.399" data-end="1002.839">So, if we load if we load Google .ca, on the left we have what this looks like in the app</span> <span data-start="1002.839" data-end="1008.23">which is basically what Google looked like 15 years ago.</span> <span data-start="1008.23" data-end="1013.89">On the right side is the SMS that you can actually see coming in your default messaging</span> <span data-start="1013.89" data-end="1015.21">app on your phone.</span> <span data-start="1015.21" data-end="1022.91">So, this entire web page took just three SMS to transmit instead of the 1300 otherwise.</span> <span data-start="1022.91" data-end="1025.88">And the code is not specific to Google.</span> <span data-start="1025.88" data-end="1029.46">It's applicable to any text based website.</span> <span data-start="1029.46" data-end="1034.39">So, we could just hard code this website instead like on one of the first few slides where</span> <span data-start="1034.39" data-end="1041.23">it's just one SMS to transmit and that would have taken even less data to send over.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1041.23" data-end="1043.449">So, I have dial up in the name of the talk.</span> <span data-start="1043.449" data-end="1048.72">And I was curious, how does this actually compare to dial up Internet?</span> <span data-start="1048.72" data-end="1054.35">On my phone, loading Google takes about 2 seconds using like regular data or Wi Fi.</span> <span data-start="1054.35" data-end="1057.66">On dial up a couple years ago, it would have taken a minute to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1057.66" data-end="1062.01">And on my phone, it's about 10 seconds when my phone is working.</span> <span data-start="1062.01" data-end="1067.49">If you're somewhere where you don't have any other axe out Internet, me travelling to Europe,</span> <span data-start="1067.49" data-end="1072.55">10 seconds is not that bad to wait for a website to load.</span> <span data-start="1072.55" data-end="1076.01">So, SMS is not secure at all.</span> <span data-start="1076.01" data-end="1079.43">It is subject to be intercepted.</span> <span data-start="1079.43" data-end="1081.17">It is not secure.</span> <span data-start="1081.17" data-end="1087.13">One of the ways I prevented people from misusing this is by removing in I kind of sign in links</span> <span data-start="1087.13" data-end="1089.9">from the HTML and doing that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1089.9" data-end="1094.67">But otherwise, this is not something that should be used to log into anything.</span> <span data-start="1094.67" data-end="1098.34">On the bright side, though, because this is a custom browser, there's no tracking.</span> <span data-start="1098.34" data-end="1104.38">So, it's technically more private than your general browser.</span> <span data-start="1104.38" data-end="1108.25">Something that would have made this project quite a bit easier is using MMS instead of</span> <span data-start="1108.25" data-end="1109.25">SMS.</span> <span data-start="1109.25" data-end="1113.22">I could have transmitted the entire website just by compressing a little bit and sending</span> <span data-start="1113.22" data-end="1119.47">it over very, very little for not that much more expensive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1119.47" data-end="1121.78">But that's not fun.</span> <span data-start="1121.78" data-end="1125.54">So, didn't do it that way.</span> <span data-start="1125.54" data-end="1127.68">There are a lot of things I want to do with this project.</span> <span data-start="1127.68" data-end="1131.69">So, phones are, by nature, bidirectional in communication.</span> <span data-start="1131.69" data-end="1135.53">So, we could do something really easily with web sockets because a server can just ping</span> <span data-start="1135.53" data-end="1137.13">the phone whenever it wants.</span> <span data-start="1137.13" data-end="1138.85">We could do AJAX.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1138.85" data-end="1144.42">For websites we visit a lot like Twitter or something, the format of every Tweet is exactly</span> <span data-start="1144.42" data-end="1145.42">the same.</span> <span data-start="1145.42" data-end="1150.7">We could store the HTML in CSS to re create the proper Twitter on our phone and just use</span> <span data-start="1150.7" data-end="1154.27">the SMS to get the actual text content.</span> <span data-start="1154.27" data-end="1156.309">We could support JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1156.309" data-end="1158.73">Might be a little difficult because we're removing so much HTML.</span> <span data-start="1158.73" data-end="1164.08">But it would be a fun problem to figure out how to map JavaScript to the HTML and properly</span> <span data-start="1164.08" data-end="1169.83">compress those and my favorite, what I'm working on now, is true dial up for this project.</span> <span data-start="1169.83" data-end="1173.45">We're not doing dial up because it's SMS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1173.45" data-end="1179.59">But we could do a phone call to transmit data like dial up used to work.</span> <span data-start="1179.59" data-end="1183.79">That would be quite a bit cheaper.</span> <span data-start="1183.79" data-end="1187.831">It would be much faster, and it would be real dial up in that case because you could use</span> <span data-start="1187.831" data-end="1191.63">your phone while the website was loading.</span> <span data-start="1191.63" data-end="1197.21">So, there are probably a lot of you thinking this is ridiculous, there are cards for this</span> <span data-start="1197.21" data-end="1198.21">purpose.</span> <span data-start="1198.21" data-end="1201.029">I didn't know about this until a couple months ago.</span> <span data-start="1201.029" data-end="1206.05">[ Laughter ] So, if you're traveling to Europe, you can</span> <span data-start="1206.05" data-end="1210.42">get a SIM card like for 20 gigs for very, very cheap.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1210.42" data-end="1215.97">And 20 gigs compared to my 2 gigs at home is essentially unlimited data.</span> <span data-start="1215.97" data-end="1218.8">This is what I get when I travel now.</span> <span data-start="1218.8" data-end="1220.7">And it's a much better solution.</span> <span data-start="1220.7" data-end="1225.059">But when I'm in Europe, I usually come for the two weeks you're allows with a SIM card</span> <span data-start="1225.059" data-end="1226.54">plus a day.</span> <span data-start="1226.54" data-end="1231.47">My project comes in handy for that one extra day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1231.47" data-end="1235.13">And so, my talk or my the code is available on my GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1235.13" data-end="1237.92">There's a link to that from my website.</span> <span data-start="1237.92" data-end="1240.63">And, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1240.63" data-end="1244.69">That's my talk.</span> <span data-start="1244.69" data-end="1247.39">Thank you.</span> </p>
