<p><span data-start="9.7" data-end="12.2">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="12.2" data-end="18.31">So, I am wondering how to start this talk off, and I was advised that it's always best</span> <span data-start="18.31" data-end="25.599">to start off from a place of truth, so, in that spirit of honesty, I guess I will start</span> <span data-start="25.599" data-end="27.539">off with my truth.</span> <span data-start="27.539" data-end="34.45">That is that, sometimes, well, to be honest, a lot of times, when it comes to the web,</span> <span data-start="34.45" data-end="37.52">I actually have no idea what it is that we are doing.</span> <span data-start="37.52" data-end="40.74">I have no idea it is we think we're doing.</span> <span data-start="40.74" data-end="48.33">Those moments of confusion tend to hit me both as a designer and a user alike before</span> <span data-start="48.33" data-end="54.86">as a user, I find myself often confronted with in wide array of products, most of which</span> <span data-start="54.86" data-end="61.13">are practically interchangeable, and neither of them really make much difference to the</span> <span data-start="61.13" data-end="64.85">core task I've been trying to do with them.</span> <span data-start="64.85" data-end="70.99">And often, even when I do subscribe to any of these products, any of these services,</span> <span data-start="70.99" data-end="78.07">I find myself quite literally afflicted by upgrades, and changes that are poorly communicated,</span> <span data-start="78.07" data-end="83.53">and, quite frankly, don't seem to have any real benefit to myself, and are definitely</span> <span data-start="83.53" data-end="86.05">an example of feature-creep.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="86.05" data-end="93.14">Which concerns me as a designer, because, certainly, on the local level, there's obviously</span> <span data-start="93.14" data-end="98.28">the impact on the users' direct experience, when we think about loading times — and</span> <span data-start="98.28" data-end="105.18">I'm also particularly concerned that these plethora of services often aren't much more</span> <span data-start="105.18" data-end="106.7">usable than the other.</span> <span data-start="106.7" data-end="112.46">They're certainly not particularly accessible, especially when you consider, in the context</span> <span data-start="112.46" data-end="118.28">of the EU, we have about 26 per cent of EU citizens who self-report that they live with</span> <span data-start="118.28" data-end="125.979">some form of disability, and, certainly, these products aren't any more ethical, which, again,</span> <span data-start="125.979" data-end="131.23">is a massive concern, especially when you're considering whether that is in terms of the</span> <span data-start="131.23" data-end="138.01">amount of time and attention they demand from the user to the security of the users' information,</span> <span data-start="138.01" data-end="143.35">even just to how they communicate what is connected by using the service, where the</span> <span data-start="143.35" data-end="147.54">data is coming from and where the data is going.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="147.54" data-end="152.36">When you put that in terms of the global context, you know, when you think of all these products</span> <span data-start="152.36" data-end="157.78">and services, which are taking up reams of service space, which has a huge environmental</span> <span data-start="157.78" data-end="164.65">cost, if you think of the 70 million servers that contribute 2 per cent to all greenhouse</span> <span data-start="164.65" data-end="170.13">emissions, not to speak of the impact of the production life cycle of the hardware on our</span> <span data-start="170.13" data-end="178.31">environmental, biological ecosystems, as well as the poorest of the global population, and,</span> <span data-start="178.31" data-end="187.09">so, in that spirit of fascination and confusion — fascination because, like many of us here,</span> <span data-start="187.09" data-end="192.46">I am someone who is generally excited and interested, and fascinated by technologies</span> <span data-start="192.46" data-end="201.4">— and I really want to take this opportunity to slightly provoke us as a community, and</span> <span data-start="201.4" data-end="207.8">start asking ourselves firstly what are we actually doing here?</span> <span data-start="207.8" data-end="211.81">And really to get into how are we doing it?</span> <span data-start="211.81" data-end="218.069">So, yes, I'm sorry, but it's that time of the day, and what we're going to talk about</span> <span data-start="218.069" data-end="219.11">is design.</span> <span data-start="219.11" data-end="225.28">A bit of content warning: the next slide has some geometric black and white animations,</span> <span data-start="225.28" data-end="230.36">but hopefully, I won't linger on that too long.</span> <span data-start="230.36" data-end="232.4">So, design.</span> <span data-start="232.4" data-end="234.42">What is design?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="234.42" data-end="242.959">For me in the context of this talk, I'm fundamentally talking about problem-solving.</span> <span data-start="242.959" data-end="248.96">When I talk about design and implicitly designers, I'm talking about those of us who are creating</span> <span data-start="248.96" data-end="256.16">something with an intent, so I'm not speaking to those of us who are backend engineers as</span> <span data-start="256.16" data-end="263.469">I am for those who are API developers and user interface designers.</span> <span data-start="263.469" data-end="269.69">To quote, "If you're someone who moves things from an existing condition to a preferred</span> <span data-start="269.69" data-end="271.99">one, you are a designer."</span> <span data-start="271.99" data-end="281.509">And so, if to design is to provoke movement, questions arise such as where are we moving</span> <span data-start="281.509" data-end="282.93">to?</span> <span data-start="282.93" data-end="284.979">What are we moving from?</span> <span data-start="284.979" data-end="289.999">And perhaps, more importantly, what is it that we are actually moving?</span> <span data-start="289.999" data-end="295.68">If we look at this ecosystem, if we think about the things we're trying to move, one</span> <span data-start="295.68" data-end="298.499">of the most obvious things is people.</span> <span data-start="298.499" data-end="304.34">We're trying to move modes of behaviour, ways of understanding.</span> <span data-start="304.34" data-end="309.68">These are all conditions that we may well either be asked by our product owners, by</span> <span data-start="309.68" data-end="316.87">ideators or innovators to change, or they may well be, that we ourselves wish to move.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.87" data-end="323.439">Often, when we start to understand where people are in order to understand how we could potentially</span> <span data-start="323.439" data-end="330.05">shift their behaviours and their ways of thinking, we tend to map out their experiences in this</span> <span data-start="330.05" data-end="331.05">particular way.</span> <span data-start="331.05" data-end="336.529">We tend to this about what they think and what they feel, what they say, and what they</span> <span data-start="336.529" data-end="339.979">hear, what they say, and what he they to.</span> <span data-start="339.979" data-end="348.749">By doing so, we are trying to get a sense of the complexity of the person who will be</span> <span data-start="348.749" data-end="351.699">using our services and our technology.</span> <span data-start="351.699" data-end="356.699">And I say "complexity", and there is, in fact, a clue in the way I phrase the segments of</span> <span data-start="356.699" data-end="362.399">the map, because, often in reality, what we find, is that this is riddled with paradoxes.</span> <span data-start="362.399" data-end="368.49">There are paradoxes between the way people think and how they feel, between what they</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="371.68">say and what they actually do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="371.68" data-end="375.52">Between the things they think they see or observe, and the things that they actually</span> <span data-start="375.52" data-end="378.61">act on and take note of.</span> <span data-start="378.61" data-end="384.05">So here we have one way of trying to understand the humans that we as designers are trying</span> <span data-start="384.05" data-end="385.05">to influence.</span> <span data-start="385.05" data-end="391.46">But already, there's a major pitfall that we are all susceptible to, and I suspect,</span> <span data-start="391.46" data-end="397.509">given that there are fascinatingly confusing state of things, we all too frequently give</span> <span data-start="397.509" data-end="399.379">into.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.379" data-end="409.789">Ultimately, what happens, is that we tend to limit the way we are mapping our users</span> <span data-start="409.789" data-end="413.419">the way we imagine and understand our users.</span> <span data-start="413.419" data-end="417.55">Too much in terms of the problem that we think we're trying to solve.</span> <span data-start="417.55" data-end="424.509">Ultimately, what that means is that we are inadequately framing the person who we think</span> <span data-start="424.509" data-end="429.369">we are trying to serve, and ultimately, this is the source of the problem.</span> <span data-start="429.369" data-end="435.759">Inadequate framing of the person leads to an inaccurate framing of the problem.</span> <span data-start="435.759" data-end="442.059">Ultimately, understanding people is meant to help us frames problems better to generate</span> <span data-start="442.059" data-end="444.029">better outcomes.</span> <span data-start="444.029" data-end="448.599">To quote: "It's easy to make bad choices when there</span> <span data-start="448.599" data-end="455.43">aren't many choices to begin with," and that is impacted by our inadequate framing of the</span> <span data-start="455.43" data-end="456.639">person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="456.639" data-end="463.059">Because, ultimately, if the problem we think we are trying to solve is all there is to</span> <span data-start="463.059" data-end="467.699">life, the universe, and everything, well, hang on, no, because it isn't.</span> <span data-start="467.699" data-end="475.779">Ultimately, it if our job is to move things into a preferred condition, it's vital to</span> <span data-start="475.779" data-end="482.029">understand the current condition, because humans don't just exist in relation to the</span> <span data-start="482.029" data-end="484.139">problems that we think we are trying to solve.</span> <span data-start="484.139" data-end="492.65">In fact, as humans, we exist in relation to many other interfering mental and social models.</span> <span data-start="492.65" data-end="502.199">We exist in relation to many other environments, natural, social, and built.</span> <span data-start="502.199" data-end="507.639">One of those built objects, one of those built environments, is the other object that we</span> <span data-start="507.639" data-end="514.23">are trying to move over to a preferred condition, and that other object is the web.</span> <span data-start="514.23" data-end="521.85">Now, at its most basic, the web is created by a computational devices communicating with</span> <span data-start="521.85" data-end="524.52">each other by an agreed protocol.</span> <span data-start="524.52" data-end="530.68">But I'm often being quite curious, because if you think about the map we use to try to</span> <span data-start="530.68" data-end="537.7">interrogate the experience of the human, what happens if we try to use that same map to</span> <span data-start="537.7" data-end="540.67">understand the experience of the web?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="540.67" data-end="546.91">Often, what happens is that, in many ways, we see that the same paradoxes apply.</span> <span data-start="546.91" data-end="553.56">Formula the internet is created of communications between computers, sending bits of information</span> <span data-start="553.56" data-end="559.52">between each other, yet, this information, regardless of the fact that it is broken down</span> <span data-start="559.52" data-end="565.42">into its binary components, is nonetheless combined with the physical structure of the</span> <span data-start="565.42" data-end="572.84">network, the physical structure that actually arises out of already existing evolving geopolitical</span> <span data-start="572.84" data-end="575.71">and economic infrastructures.</span> <span data-start="575.71" data-end="581.43">It's that which contributes to fundamental inequalities, as to which languages with more</span> <span data-start="581.43" data-end="587.52">dominant, who has access to the web in the first place, when they do, and how.</span> <span data-start="587.52" data-end="594.59">So, to clarify, what is going on is that the inequalities we see on the web scheme from</span> <span data-start="594.59" data-end="597.88">the material nature of the web.</span> <span data-start="597.88" data-end="603.93">These inequalities that impact what people get to read, see, how secure their data might</span> <span data-start="603.93" data-end="609.45">be, and indeed how safe they might be as a citizen of their country.</span> <span data-start="609.45" data-end="614.96">And it's the materiality of the web which is where, as designers, our concern for the</span> <span data-start="614.96" data-end="618.05">environmental impact of the web should also come in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.05" data-end="623.62">After all, all those servers are what helps to contribute to the fact that the web is</span> <span data-start="623.62" data-end="638.83">the fourth largest producer of C02 after the United States, China, and India.</span> <span data-start="638.83" data-end="646.09">What you have is an object made up of the relationship between the human and the web,</span> <span data-start="646.09" data-end="652.97">or our solution, the things that transmits movement to the system to move this relationship</span> <span data-start="652.97" data-end="658.67">to a different way of being, actually becomes a part of the system.</span> <span data-start="658.67" data-end="665.51">Ultimately, the intersection of the web, the user, and whatever additional dynamics we</span> <span data-start="665.51" data-end="673.06">create will create in turn another emergent system, and, like all emergent systems, it</span> <span data-start="673.06" data-end="674.93">is complex in nature.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="674.93" data-end="684.2">It is chaotic, and unpredictable, arises into huge and often un seen phase shifts.</span> <span data-start="684.2" data-end="690.62">Sometimes, it's often what results in cases like this.</span> <span data-start="690.62" data-end="697.23">So this is a screen shot from a developer, Jackie Arsino, who is one of who noticed that</span> <span data-start="697.23" data-end="706.32">the fact that the facial recognition software that Google had put in place was incapable</span> <span data-start="706.32" data-end="711.76">of realising that black people were, in fact, human beings, and, instead, categorised them</span> <span data-start="711.76" data-end="713.48">as gorillas.</span> <span data-start="713.48" data-end="719.42">I always point to this example, partly because it is pretty famous, and most people have</span> <span data-start="719.42" data-end="724.92">at least heard an inkling of it, but I think in terms of what I'm trying to talk about,</span> <span data-start="724.92" data-end="731.9">in terms of designing for this human and web system, it highlights some of the key assumptions</span> <span data-start="731.9" data-end="736.25">that we tend to infect our solutions with.</span> <span data-start="736.25" data-end="742.32">It highlights assumptions about what aspects of the human need to be taken into consideration,</span> <span data-start="742.32" data-end="748.37">and particularly in the case of this example, my lights our assumptions about our ability</span> <span data-start="748.37" data-end="756.52">to manage and solve any resultant errors in the service we think we are providing.</span> <span data-start="756.52" data-end="760.53">Seeing this kind of stuff is fascinating for me as a user-experience designer, because</span> <span data-start="760.53" data-end="763.6">it is enough to make anyone cry.</span> </p>
