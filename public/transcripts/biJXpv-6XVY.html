<p><span data-start="98.45" data-end="102.659">The fist one is what does it mean for layout to be disfunctional.</span> <span data-start="102.659" data-end="108.049">And I would say that layout isn't disfunctional at all for static or mostly static web sites,</span> <span data-start="108.049" data-end="114.549">when you a few animations maybe they're simple an animation in or out or their web site isn't</span> <span data-start="114.549" data-end="120.59">that isic at all the layout primitives that we have are perfect.</span> <span data-start="120.59" data-end="127.1">But, if we're to compare ourselves to native layouts, I'd say it's a real libraries constrained</span> <span data-start="127.1" data-end="130.65">language, especially for continuous motion.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="130.65" data-end="134.36">When it comes to coordinating animations, I don't think the web is really well suited</span> <span data-start="134.36" data-end="139.03">for that, I don't they we have a strong language to express it.</span> <span data-start="139.03" data-end="142.11">So, what's holding layout back?</span> <span data-start="142.11" data-end="146.36">There's the obvious one that a lot of people talk about which is performance, and usually</span> <span data-start="146.36" data-end="151.69">that comes down to reflow being really costly, especially when you have a nested DOM, many</span> <span data-start="151.69" data-end="156.5">Elements are dependent on the layout of other Elements, so once one Element changes the</span> <span data-start="156.5" data-end="161.8">browser has to do expensive calculations, but I think something that we don't talk about</span> <span data-start="161.8" data-end="163.32">is expressibility.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.32" data-end="167.72">And I'd say that we don't actually have the right primitives, the right language to real</span> <span data-start="167.72" data-end="173.25">libraries talk about doing rich animations coordinated Gesture based kind of layout that</span> <span data-start="173.25" data-end="178.099">we see in the native world.</span> <span data-start="178.099" data-end="181.25">, the three pillars of the web.</span> <span data-start="181.25" data-end="184.25">And we can ask where does layout belong.</span> <span data-start="184.25" data-end="190.41">And layout is the purview of HTML and CSS, HTML usually you don't think about doing anything</span> <span data-start="190.41" data-end="195.64">with layout, but HTML makes it's own opinions on layout, the normal browser flow, block</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.64" data-end="200.59">Elements are placed underneath each other and to the side of one another, and you can</span> <span data-start="200.59" data-end="205.751">think that CSS is really just there to modify the flow in a separation of concerning kind</span> <span data-start="205.751" data-end="215.41">of way\h‑‑ tons of layouts in CSS, but it's important to know that HTML also makes</span> <span data-start="215.41" data-end="221.62">an opinion on layout, we have this idea of layout and it's inside of two objects.</span> <span data-start="221.62" data-end="227.83">The whole point of separation of concern is that HTML should not be concerned about layout.</span> <span data-start="227.83" data-end="233.42">And then there's the lonely guy JavaScript, out to the side and youthy that JavaScript</span> <span data-start="233.42" data-end="238.04">is being able to modify CSS on the fly or maybe HTML 2.</span> <span data-start="238.04" data-end="242.371">But, usually when we think about layout we tonight think about JavaScript, and that's</span> <span data-start="242.371" data-end="244.48">what I'd Reich to change.</span> <span data-start="244.48" data-end="252.24">If I were to organize these HTML would be static layout, CSS would be about a binary</span> <span data-start="252.24" data-end="257.79">form of layout.</span> <span data-start="257.79" data-end="264.479">You might change a color, you an animation, still you're flippage switch, you're not continuously</span> <span data-start="264.479" data-end="268.78">changing a piece of data even though the animation is continuous, you're just turning on and</span> <span data-start="268.78" data-end="279.879">off and queuing a continuous thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="279.879" data-end="285.849">Doing like a swipe Gesture, I even just the most basic thing like that, that I like to</span> <span data-start="285.849" data-end="289.58">create is you need to include JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="289.58" data-end="290.58">There's no way to do that?</span> <span data-start="290.58" data-end="295.46">Just HTML and CSS by itself.</span> <span data-start="295.46" data-end="300.69">So I talked about the separation concerns, HTML is supposed to be just about content,</span> <span data-start="300.69" data-end="305.96">but many people find themselves in this tag soup where they start wrapping the actual</span> <span data-start="305.96" data-end="309.759">content and other tags just to do something about presentation.</span> <span data-start="309.759" data-end="316.409">Flex Box goes a long way in helping this but Flex Box also has reflow problems, I don't</span> <span data-start="316.409" data-end="320.62">think it's\h‑‑ it's great solution for some things, but I'd like something a little</span> <span data-start="320.62" data-end="321.62">bit more powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.62" data-end="326.8">So, I have a question, why do we use HTML for presentation?</span> <span data-start="326.8" data-end="331.199">If we really had this abstraction of concern, you would never even see this, you would have</span> <span data-start="331.199" data-end="336.36">some other way of saying that the <div>, the content is centered.</span> <span data-start="336.36" data-end="338.09">It wouldn't be an HTML.</span> <span data-start="338.09" data-end="342.45">And my answer to this question is that it's the only tree around.</span> <span data-start="342.45" data-end="346.689">And layout is necessarily a tree kind of data structure, things are provisioned relative</span> <span data-start="346.689" data-end="350.78">to other things, so you have this natural tree that comes out of play.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.78" data-end="354.87">But there is no other tray in the way, there's just HTML, you can think that CSS is like</span> <span data-start="354.87" data-end="359.789">a tree that's cascading, but that's just a layer on top of the HTML tree.</span> <span data-start="359.789" data-end="365.87">So, not that that's a bad idea, but what I'm about to</span> <span data-start="365.87" data-end="367.569">say might be a bad idea.</span> <span data-start="367.569" data-end="369.009">I have this idea.</span> <span data-start="369.009" data-end="372.06">You can tell me if it is bad.</span> <span data-start="372.06" data-end="374.83">Can we virtualise, can we actually separate the virtue of concerns where</span> <span data-start="374.83" data-end="379.999">we have our position layer where we turn some layout</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="379.999" data-end="386.509">DOM things and flatten it out into style, we do the inside</span> <span data-start="386.509" data-end="389.25">of JavaScript, is there some way to go from the</span> <span data-start="389.25" data-end="395.069">top to the bottom.</span> <span data-start="395.069" data-end="400.759">Browsers always do this anyway, because they draw things to the bottom of the screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="400.759" data-end="402.5">This is what they do.</span> <span data-start="402.5" data-end="406.12">These slides are a few years old.</span> <span data-start="406.12" data-end="412.919">But I'm pretty sure that things are similar .. now</span> <span data-start="412.919" data-end="416.15">Chrome uses blink, but Chrome and Safari use WebKit as</span> <span data-start="416.15" data-end="420.93">a rendering engine and Firefox uses Gecko, and they both</span> <span data-start="420.93" data-end="423.509">have this thing called a render tree or frame tree,</span> <span data-start="423.509" data-end="428.229">in the case of Gecko, and what this is is just a representation</span> <span data-start="428.229" data-end="432.37">of your document in terms of rectangles.</span> <span data-start="432.37" data-end="437.539">So Gecko takes your DOM and CSS styles and past everything and</span> <span data-start="437.539" data-end="440.27">at some point pipeline, the only thing that they care about</span> <span data-start="440.27" data-end="444.789">are rectangles on the screen .. then they paint</span> <span data-start="444.789" data-end="446.939">those rectangles with your content, okay?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="446.939" data-end="451.99">So what I'd like to do is take this part out of the browser and</span> <span data-start="451.99" data-end="455.849">into the hands of the developer.</span> <span data-start="455.849" data-end="459.05">The way we do that is kind of crazy.</span> <span data-start="459.05" data-end="461.49">We position absolute things in CSS.</span> <span data-start="461.49" data-end="465.02">This isn't everything, just things we want to animate.</span> <span data-start="465.02" data-end="469.8">The things we think are presentational and not to do</span> <span data-start="469.8" data-end="471.27">with content.</span> <span data-start="471.27" data-end="475.219">We create our own render tree in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="475.219" data-end="476.99">So that way, by positioning absolute everything in</span> <span data-start="476.99" data-end="479.21">CSS we've taken it out of the browser's normal flow</span> <span data-start="479.21" data-end="482.59">and have manual positioning on things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.59" data-end="486.02">So we can create this render tree in JavaScript, it is pretty ghetto</span> <span data-start="486.02" data-end="490.139">version of a tree here, bunch of nodes and the leaves</span> <span data-start="490.139" data-end="496.879">of this tree are actual HTML dips.</span> <span data-start="496.879" data-end="501.69">We can give these nodes some kind of layout properties, maybe some translation,</span> <span data-start="501.69" data-end="505.1">if we give A and B these translation values we'd</span> <span data-start="505.1" data-end="507.699">expect, before it touches the DOM, that we can flatten</span> <span data-start="507.699" data-end="513.13">this and style the DOM 150 pixels by 200 pixels.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="513.13" data-end="516.75">Just a combination of the two previous nodes.</span> <span data-start="516.75" data-end="519.57">And we can be clever with other layout properties too, but</span> <span data-start="519.57" data-end="522.321">things on CSS, the percentage based properties we can</span> <span data-start="522.321" data-end="526.51">define CU with some kind of size and align the relative</span> <span data-start="526.51" data-end="531.21">to that size, so that would be just C and D would</span> <span data-start="531.21" data-end="534.011">be a combination of 50 pixels to the right, and</span> <span data-start="534.011" data-end="537.48">25 pixels down combined with translate for A, and we</span> <span data-start="537.48" data-end="539.7">get 150 by 225.</span> <span data-start="539.7" data-end="541.62">Oh God.</span> <span data-start="541.62" data-end="545.47">Everyone should use GPG.</span> <span data-start="545.47" data-end="550.28">Oh, I have due module.</span> <span data-start="550.28" data-end="551.28">Okay.</span> <span data-start="551.28" data-end="555.98">So just to remind me when the demos are, actually.</span> <span data-start="555.98" data-end="561.14">So the logical conclusion of this, if we take it to the point of absurdity, is to build</span> <span data-start="561.14" data-end="568.22">a tree in JavaScript, or build a tree in HTML, but actually,</span> <span data-start="568.22" data-end="569.6">everything is flat.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="569.6" data-end="575.51">If we inspect the element here  —  and I scroll down here  —  that's the first</span> <span data-start="575.51" data-end="577.51">node second node all of these things are on the exact</span> <span data-start="577.51" data-end="578.51">same level.</span> <span data-start="578.51" data-end="580.12">It is entirely flat.</span> <span data-start="580.12" data-end="585.47">So you can do this in CSS, you'd have some crazy nesting thing going on, the</span> <span data-start="585.47" data-end="587.69">layers.</span> <span data-start="587.69" data-end="591.51">There is content here and I just tried to be  —  can you</span> <span data-start="591.51" data-end="595.19">see that?</span> <span data-start="595.19" data-end="598.97">There is content inside of these, this little smiley face and just for effect I put it inside</span> <span data-start="598.97" data-end="600.55">two spans.</span> <span data-start="600.55" data-end="605.51">You can nest whatever you want inside of here, but the important thing is that the outside</span> <span data-start="605.51" data-end="606.52">is flat.</span> <span data-start="606.52" data-end="608.43">Not the content.</span> <span data-start="608.43" data-end="610.83">And close this for a second.</span> <span data-start="610.83" data-end="612.77">And we can animate this tree also.</span> <span data-start="612.77" data-end="616.94">So the whole point is to have all these animations going on, and we</span> <span data-start="616.94" data-end="621.27">avoid the problems of reflow here because everything</span> <span data-start="621.27" data-end="623.85">will one it is all hardware accelerate you learned what</span> <span data-start="623.85" data-end="627.1">that meant in the last talk and two, everything is flat</span> <span data-start="627.1" data-end="632.49">so the DOM has to do very little calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="632.49" data-end="634.48">So you can imagine there is this tree going on, and just the</span> <span data-start="634.48" data-end="637.56">numbers inside the nodes are changing and trickle down, so</span> <span data-start="637.56" data-end="640.58">one branch moves and moves all the other branches, and</span> <span data-start="640.58" data-end="642.72">then you have this funny tree.</span> <span data-start="642.72" data-end="643.72">Okay.</span> <span data-start="643.72" data-end="645.46">Back to the talk.</span> <span data-start="645.46" data-end="647.92">You weren't supposed to see that.</span> <span data-start="647.92" data-end="650.76">Okay, so you might have seen this like plaster on</span> <span data-start="650.76" data-end="654.28">the surface, so this is Samsara, is this library I've</span> <span data-start="654.28" data-end="655.28">been writing.</span> <span data-start="655.28" data-end="662.74">It is originally where Myles and I both worked, and it is meant to kind of be a language</span> <span data-start="662.74" data-end="665.04">for this kind of stuff, and some of the ideas</span> <span data-start="665.04" data-end="672.75">are similar.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="672.75" data-end="674.97">With layout and JavaScript, the question is what can we</span> <span data-start="674.97" data-end="677.91">now do?</span> <span data-start="677.91" data-end="681.21">And I have this theory that CSS was always designed for point and click.</span> <span data-start="681.21" data-end="685.12">You have power tribute or you have animation that goes on and off; it</span> <span data-start="685.12" data-end="686.57">is not about continuous motion.</span> <span data-start="686.57" data-end="687.8">The JavaScript can be.</span> <span data-start="687.8" data-end="689.91">That's the whole point.</span> <span data-start="689.91" data-end="693.71">I'm super excited about streams, as you can tell.</span> <span data-start="693.71" data-end="699.31">That's largest font size in the entire talk and all these ideas, the functional reactive</span> <span data-start="699.31" data-end="701.7">programming too, you might have seen in the other talks,</span> <span data-start="701.7" data-end="706.55">because we can think about CSS not as this tree but one</span> <span data-start="706.55" data-end="707.74">giant stream.</span> </p>
