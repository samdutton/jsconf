data-end="556.699">information through now we could add</span> <span data-start="556.699" data-end="558.499">other things to these to these</span> <span data-start="558.499" data-end="560.72">interfaces so for instance let's say</span> <span data-start="560.72" data-end="562.609">that it's greater options also I can</span> <span data-start="562.609" data-end="565.309">have a function on it so we can say that</span> <span data-start="565.309" data-end="567.139">there's a function foo which takes an X</span> <span data-start="567.139"

data-end="584.689">equals greeting dot you'll start to see</span> <span data-start="584.689" data-end="586.339">we get a little bit of type inference so</span> <span data-start="586.339" data-end="588.619">because we know that food takes a number</span> <span data-start="588.619" data-end="590.149">and returns a number that means we know</span> <span data-start="590.149" data-end="591.949">that X is a number and so we're actually</span> <span data-start="591.949" data-end="593.389">we don't have to add type annotations</span> <span data-start="593.389" data-end="594.41">for these things a lot of this</span> <span data-start="594.41" data-end="595.579">information is just going to flow</span> <span data-start="595.579" data-end="600.41">through type

one</span> <span data-start="605.6" data-end="607.519">thing but JavaScript objects can sort of</span> <span data-start="607.519" data-end="609.169">do a few other things other than just</span> <span data-start="609.169" data-end="611.029">have properties so one thing they can do</span> <span data-start="611.029" data-end="612.679">is they can be callable they can</span> <span data-start="612.679" data-end="614.899">effectively be function like and so</span> <span data-start="614.899" data-end="615.98">imagine that we want to indicate that</span> <span data-start="615.98" data-end="619.279">our

here we can do</span> <span data-start="624.829" data-end="628.009">something like you know we can take this</span> <span data-start="628.009" data-end="629.66">greeting and while it still has a</span> <span data-start="629.66" data-end="631.85">message property in a foo property it</span> <span data-start="631.85" data-end="634.069">also can be called and we call that we</span> <span

data-start="639.459" data-end="641.66">now one last thing here</span> <span data-start="641.66" data-end="643.249">another thing that JavaScript objects</span> <span data-start="643.249" data-end="645.47">can sort of quality they can have is</span> <span data-start="645.47" data-end="646.91">that they can sort of be indexable that</span> <span data-start="646.91" data-end="649.79">they can be array like objects and so</span> <span data-start="649.79" data-end="651.619">here we can say that if I index this on</span> <span data-start="651.619" data-end="653.389">a number I'm gonna get back a date</span> <span data-start="653.389" data-end="655.91">object and so now if we come in here and</span> <span data-start="655.91"

data-end="665.449">example like this like what kind of</span> <span data-start="665.449" data-end="666.98">object is gonna be callable and</span> <span data-start="666.98" data-end="668.48">indexable

than this right</span> <span data-start="673.669" data-end="675.439">there there's a lot of host objects that</span> <span data-start="675.439" data-end="678.11">that have some pretty strange api's and</span> <span data-start="678.11" data-end="680.48">by trying to model taking the runtime</span> <span data-start="680.48" data-end="682.329">type system that javascript has</span> <span

data-end="691.989">expose it into tools and documentation</span> <span data-start="691.989" data-end="695.829">and static analysis okay so that's a</span> <span data-start="695.829" data-end="699.399">quick look at at some of the well let me</span> <span data-start="699.399" data-end="701.29">just let me just actually go back to the</span> <span data-start="701.29" data-end="705.369">the basic version of this so one other</span> <span data-start="705.369" data-end="708.04">thing with types that I should note we</span> <span data-start="708.04" data-end="709.449">added this one type annotation here and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="709.449" data-end="710.679">I showed how that kind of gives you some</span> <span data-start="710.679" data-end="713.079">some tooling benefits it turns out we</span> <span data-start="713.079" data-end="714.429">were actually getting a few tooling</span> <span data-start="714.429" data-end="716.23">benefits kind of already for free in</span> <span data-start="716.23" data-end="717.73">this code even when we just pasted it in</span> <span data-start="717.73" data-end="719.799">the raw JavaScript and that's because by</span> <span data-start="719.799" data-end="722.17">default we give you typing for the core</span> <span data-start="722.17" data-end="724.6">browser primitives so all the Dom API is</span> <span data-start="724.6" data-end="727.449">all the es five core libraries and so if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="727.449" data-end="728.949">I hover over document we see we know</span> <span data-start="728.949" data-end="731.529">that thing is a document and therefore</span> <span data-start="731.529" data-end="732.819">we know that create element is a</span> <span data-start="732.819" data-end="734.589">function which takes a string and</span> <span data-start="734.589" data-end="736.899">returns an HTML element and we know that</span> <span data-start="736.899" data-end="738.67">it has an errant text property and this</span> <span data-start="738.67" data-end="740.23">is all useful because it means that if I</span> <span data-start="740.23" data-end="742.149">mistyped something here we're gonna get</span> <span data-start="742.149" data-end="744.279">that error as well so even when I'm just</span> <span data-start="744.279" data-end="745.869">pasting in JavaScript code we're able to</span> <span data-start="745.869" data-end="747.549">sort of do some checking against your</span> <span data-start="747.549" data-end="749.529">code because we know something about the</span> <span data-start="749.529" data-end="753.369">the core libraries that you're using all</span> <span data-start="753.369" data-end="756.129">right so that's a quick look at types in</span> <span data-start="756.129" data-end="758.499">typescript so the next thing that we we</span> <span data-start="758.499" data-end="761.29">give you is is classes in classes</span> <span data-start="761.29" data-end="763.059">generally are just a useful tool for</span> <span data-start="763.059" data-end="765.639">kind of this structuring of code there's</span> <span data-start="765.639" data-end="767.679">a lot of good design patterns that the</span> <span data-start="767.679" data-end="769.269">developers are used to for for how to</span> <span data-start="769.269" data-end="771.249">think through classes the classes in</span> <span data-start="771.249" data-end="773.35">typescript are actually very simple and</span> <span data-start="773.35" data-end="774.879">lightweight they're they're very much</span> <span data-start="774.879" data-end="776.589">aligned with what's being discussed</span> <span data-start="776.589" data-end="778.299">currently in the echo script standards</span> <span data-start="778.299" data-end="780.249">body for ACMA script six the maximum and</span> <span data-start="780.249" data-end="783.1">minimum classes proposal it's basically</span> <span data-start="783.1" data-end="784.869">just ultimately a way of hooking up you</span> <span data-start="784.869" data-end="786.879">know the standard constructor with with</span> <span data-start="786.879" data-end="789.149">prototype properties prototype methods</span> <span data-start="789.149" data-end="791.47">pattern using a single sort of</span> <span data-start="791.47" data-end="792.73">declarative construct instead of</span> <span data-start="792.73" data-end="796.089">smashing it together manually and so</span> <span data-start="796.089" data-end="797.619">you'll see that this code if you've seen</span> <span data-start="797.619" data-end="799.959">what the es6 classes look like the code</span> <span data-start="799.959" data-end="802.089">here is is effectively identical to</span> <span data-start="802.089" data-end="803.799">those the key thing that's different</span> <span data-start="803.799" data-end="806.559">here is even typescript we let you</span> <span data-start="806.559" data-end="808.509">describe what properties you have and</span> <span data-start="808.509" data-end="811.209">what types those properties have this is</span> <span data-start="811.209" data-end="812.47">way of getting that type information</span> <span data-start="812.47" data-end="815.709">back into the tool again you can see on</span> <span data-start="815.709" data-end="816.25">the right hand</span> <span data-start="816.25" data-end="818.05">we code generate this into a fairly</span> <span data-start="818.05" data-end="820.33">standard pattern here this is more or</span> <span data-start="820.33" data-end="822.19">less the kind of code that you would</span> <span data-start="822.19" data-end="823.84">likely write if you're gonna write this</span> <span data-start="823.84" data-end="825.16">kind of thing out by hand</span> <span data-start="825.16" data-end="826.87">and so we're really trying to make sure</span> <span data-start="826.87" data-end="828.13">that the code we generate is really</span> <span data-start="828.13" data-end="829.84">simple and clean and has a one-to-one</span> <span data-start="829.84" data-end="832.09">correspondence with with a typescript</span> <span data-start="832.09" data-end="835.18">code that you write in now classes are</span> <span data-start="835.18" data-end="837.07">actually particularly interesting for</span> <span data-start="837.07" data-end="838.42">language like typescript which has a</span> <span data-start="838.42" data-end="840.55">sort of static type system that it's</span> <span data-start="840.55" data-end="843.1">offering because the class defines not</span> <span data-start="843.1" data-end="845.32">just a constructor object that you can</span> <span data-start="845.32" data-end="846.19">use at runtime</span> <span data-start="846.19" data-end="848.32">it also finds a type which is the type</span> <span data-start="848.32" data-end="850.42">of the instances that are created by</span> <span data-start="850.42" data-end="852.46">that constructor function and that means</span> <span data-start="852.46" data-end="853.81">that down here when we created that new</span> <span data-start="853.81" data-end="856.15">greeter object we actually see that we</span> <span data-start="856.15" data-end="857.86">know that that thing has type greeter</span> <span data-start="857.86" data-end="860.17">which means for instance that if we look</span> <span data-start="860.17" data-end="862.54">at the greet function here we know what</span> <span data-start="862.54" data-end="864.31">type that has we know that it takes no</span> <span

data-end="869.17">see the highlighting here you can see</span> <span data-start="869.17" data-end="871.3">this is referring to the the greet</span> <span data-start="871.3" data-end="873.19">function to find up here and that's</span> <span data-start="873.19" data-end="874.06">something that would traditionally be</span> <span data-start="874.06" data-end="875.65">quite hard to do with JavaScript to know</span> <span data-start="875.65" data-end="876.97">that there was that association between</span> <span data-start="876.97" data-end="879.37">those pieces of code because you know in</span> <span data-start="879.37" data-end="880.78">general we could have a lot of different</span> <span data-start="880.78" data-end="882.04">things happening that could make that</span> <span data-start="882.04" data-end="884.11">name bound resolve to something in a</span> <span data-start="884.11" data-end="886.06">very different place but with the static</span> <span data-start="886.06" data-end="887.2">type system we're actually able to</span> <span data-start="887.2" data-end="890.05">resolve how how those connections are</span> <span data-start="890.05" data-end="890.55">made</span> <span data-start="890.55" data-end="892.57">one of the other nice things that offers</span> <span data-start="892.57" data-end="894.25">is the ability to do some some richer</span> <span data-start="894.25" data-end="897.31">kind of ID services so if I come in here</span> <span data-start="897.31" data-end="900.7">and say rename we can come and say oops</span>

<p><span data-start="900.7" data-end="903.61">I keep doing that too much we can come</span> <span data-start="903.61" data-end="908.32">and say change this to say hello and do</span> <span data-start="908.32" data-end="910.24">every sort of rename in line of our code</span> <span data-start="910.24" data-end="911.86">and actually change both the definition</span> <span data-start="911.86" data-end="914.74">site and the and the use site and at</span> <span data-start="914.74" data-end="916.21">once and obviously the JavaScript that</span> <span data-start="916.21" data-end="917.44">we got generated out on the other side</span> <span data-start="917.44" data-end="918.94">so we can offer some of these sort of</span> <span data-start="918.94" data-end="922.27">richer IDE services inside this kind of</span> <span data-start="922.27" data-end="925.69">environment so the the last sort of</span> <span data-start="925.69" data-end="929.86">major concept that the typescript brings</span> <span data-start="929.86" data-end="931.3">in and this one's also something that's</span> <span data-start="931.3" data-end="935.65">being worked on in in the es6 group is</span> <span data-start="935.65" data-end="938.61">the the notion of modules and so modules</span> <span data-start="938.61" data-end="940.87">and this first example might this is</span> <span data-start="940.87" data-end="942.16">just an internal module so the ability</span> <span data-start="942.16" data-end="944.17">to just declare a module that I can use</span> <span data-start="944.17" data-end="947.38">within my single file here and you see I</span> <span data-start="947.38" data-end="949.15">just took my greeter function I stuck it</span> <span data-start="949.15" data-end="950.26">inside a module</span> <span data-start="950.26" data-end="952.93">and a couple of things the outer module</span> <span data-start="952.93" data-end="955">here just becomes a simple sort of</span> <span data-start="955" data-end="958.14">closure around around the code I wrote</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="958.14" data-end="961.33">I'm exporting this class which means I'm</span> <span data-start="961.33" data-end="963.88">just gonna stick it as a property on the</span> <span data-start="963.88" data-end="966.7">object that I'm exporting here and we</span> <span data-start="966.7" data-end="967.63">can do the some of the standard things</span> <span data-start="967.63" data-end="969.7">that we would do inside any sort of</span> <span data-start="969.7" data-end="971.74">closure of programming in JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="971.74" data-end="973.48">I can for instance take that string I'm</span> <span data-start="973.48" data-end="975.4">using in there and just grab it out as</span> <span data-start="975.4" data-end="977.31">sort of a local private

data</span> <span data-start="981.88" data-end="983.62">property but it is being captured in</span> <span data-start="983.62" data-end="985.78">that in that closure there so do all</span> <span data-start="985.78" data-end="987.7">those same kinds of programming styles</span> <span data-start="987.7" data-end="990.07">but again modules are useful to</span> <span data-start="990.07" data-end="991.78">typescript in particular because they</span> <span data-start="991.78" data-end="993.88">provide some structure over the types as</span> <span data-start="993.88" data-end="996.46">well as a structure over the values and</span> <span data-start="996.46" data-end="998.86">so here we have a greeter type that's</span> <span data-start="998.86"

data-end="1134.97">and so we have things like this HTML</span> <span data-start="1134.97" data-end="1137.34">element and this if I just right click</span> <span data-start="1137.34" data-end="1139.86">and say go to definition it'll drop us</span> <span data-start="1139.86" data-end="1142.2">into this file that we provide called</span> </p>

data-end="1189.24">provide over a lot of the Dom API s and</span> <span data-start="1189.24" data-end="1190.53">that means that were able to take all</span> <span data-start="1190.53" data-end="1193.14">that information that's available in the</span> <span data-start="1193.14" data-end="1194.67">standard from the standard specs and</span> <span data-start="1194.67" data-end="1196.59">actually make that available into sort</span> <span data-start="1196.59" data-end="1198">of tooling environment here so you can</span> <span data-start="1198" data-end="1199.65">use that for static analysis you can use</span> <span data-start="1199.65" data-end="1201.81">that for getting completion lists and</span> <span data-start="1201.81" data-end="1203.22">refactoring and all that kind of thing</span> <span data-start="1203.22" data-end="1205.8">so this is actually a pretty useful</span> <span data-start="1205.8" data-end="1208.89">thing now we do that automatically for</span> <span data-start="1208.89" data-end="1210.78">the Dom which is one very big library</span> <span data-start="1210.78" data-end="1212.55">but of course we also want that kind of</span> <span

data-start="1216.06" data-end="1217.56">using or writing or</span> <span data-start="1217.56" data-end="1220.02">with and so you see in this example</span> <span data-start="1220.02" data-end="1223.08">we're actually also using jQuery and so</span> <span data-start="1223.08" data-end="1226.35">if I do dollar you know open paren you</span> <span data-start="1226.35" data-end="1228.39">see we can actually get sort of some</span> <span data-start="1228.39" data-end="1229.71">some hints about what the different</span> <span data-start="1229.71" data-end="1231.84">overloads of this function are and so</span> <span data-start="1231.84" data-end="1233.31">it's basically seven different patterns</span> <span data-start="1233.31" data-end="1235.65">for how we can call jQuery and they each</span> <span data-start="1235.65" data-end="1237.63">take sort of different combinations of</span> <span data-start="1237.63" data-end="1239.22">parameters we can get that information</span> <span data-start="1239.22" data-end="1243.36">again in the ID environment if I do just</span> <span data-start="1243.36" data-end="1245.58">one of these and hit dot yeah you'll see</span> <span data-start="1245.58" data-end="1247.2">that we can get back you know is sort of</span> <span data-start="1247.2" data-end="1248.49">a list of the members that are available</span> <span data-start="1248.49" data-end="1250.74">in here you see things like we have add</span> <span data-start="1250.74" data-end="1252.3">class which again is sort of overloaded</span> <span data-start="1252.3" data-end="1253.83">there's two sort of valid ways to call</span> <span data-start="1253.83" data-end="1256.47">it one of the interesting things to note</span> <span data-start="1256.47" data-end="1260.46">is if I go to definition on this it's</span> <span data-start="1260.46" data-end="1263.03">gonna drop me into this jQuery DTS file</span> <span data-start="1263.03" data-end="1265.35">and this is just a file that we've</span> <span data-start="1265.35" data-end="1267.15">written we've sort of written this based</span> <span data-start="1267.15" data-end="1269.16">on the jQuery documentation and you know</span> <span data-start="1269.16" data-end="1269.97">there's a lot of stuff that actually</span> <span data-start="1269.97" data-end="1271.62">isn't captured really fully in the API</span> <span data-start="1271.62" data-end="1273.12">documentation so kind of going and</span> <span data-start="1273.12" data-end="1275.16">making sure that we have the information</span> <span data-start="1275.16" data-end="1277.68">correct beyond that but this is trying</span> <span data-start="1277.68" data-end="1279.78">to capture all of the typing of this API</span> <span data-start="1279.78" data-end="1281.19">surface area and this is sort of a</span> <span data-start="1281.19" data-end="1285.87">formalization of of documentation and so</span> <span data-start="1285.87" data-end="1287.01">this is something that you know</span> <span data-start="1287.01" data-end="1288.3">obviously we could do this for a bunch</span> <span data-start="1288.3" data-end="1289.5">of different libraries and we're talking</span> <span data-start="1289.5" data-end="1290.97">to a bunch of library vendors including</span> <span data-start="1290.97" data-end="1292.83">the j.crew folks about you know what the</span> <span data-start="1292.83" data-end="1295.05">best approach is for developing and</span> <span data-start="1295.05" data-end="1297.14">maintaining these things going
