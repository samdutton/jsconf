data-end="804.209">post-modernism and collage so the term</span> <span data-start="804.209" data-end="807.42">collage was actually mentioned in the</span> <span data-start="807.42" data-end="809.42">beginning of 20th century</span> <span data-start="809.42" data-end="813.93">by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso I I</span> <span data-start="813.93" data-end="815.88">guess that you

data-start="818.97" data-end="822.209">media and you must say that it looks</span> <span data-start="822.209" data-end="826.35">very creative and I think that working</span> <span data-start="826.35" data-end="830.37">with paper and scissors brings a lot of</span> <span data-start="830.37" data-end="834.36">ideas and that only is very relaxing but</span> <span data-start="834.36" data-end="837.11">also abroad in your artistic horizons</span> <span data-start="837.11" data-end="842.85">and and bring a lot of ideas so I'm a</span> <span data-start="842.85" data-end="845.85">super inspired by one Polish girl one</span> <span data-start="845.85" data-end="846.87">polish designer</span> <span data-start="846.87" data-end="849.99">her name is Baracus and

<p><span data-start="859.49" data-end="863.21">Spotify also fashion brands and when I</span> <span data-start="863.21" data-end="865.79">see her work I immediately think how I</span> <span data-start="865.79" data-end="867.529">can reuse some of the concept and</span> <span data-start="867.529" data-end="870.83">transfer it to to the World Wide Web so</span> <span data-start="870.83" data-end="875">I started seeing CSS just like ik</span> <span data-start="875" data-end="878">Caesars and and and I think that's super</span> <span data-start="878" data-end="880.97">creative tool so I'm such a huge fan of</span> <span data-start="880.97" data-end="882.56">barcodes that I also attended her</span> <span data-start="882.56" data-end="886.48">workshops where we were supposed

data-end="902.6">with sketching before you actually sit -</span> <span data-start="902.6" data-end="906.95">the graphics editor you can just take</span> <span data-start="906.95" data-end="911.27">all your creative ideas and just present</span> <span data-start="911.27" data-end="913.64">it on a paper it's it's much more easier</span> <span data-start="913.64" data-end="917.15">rather than

you</span> <span data-start="924.5" data-end="926">can see here if there are some images</span> <span data-start="926" data-end="930.23">but I used CSS to actually cut it out</span> <span data-start="930.23" data-end="932.69">and you can see some see-through you can</span> <span data-start="932.69" data-end="934.82">see some flowers coming up from from the</span> <span data-start="934.82" data-end="937.94">jacket you can see some glitter and also</span> <span data-start="937.94" data-end="942.14">glitter under women's eyes so I used CSS</span> <span data-start="942.14" data-end="948.2">masking so masking helps us to reveal or</span> <span data-start="948.2" data-end="951.23">excite some some elements in CSS it also</span> <span

it's counted like the the levels of</span> <span data-start="969.89" data-end="973.959">transparency so here in this example</span> <span data-start="973.959" data-end="978.83">there's a we've got a

data-start="1038.97" data-end="1041.86">we have also CSS clipping which is to me</span> <span data-start="1041.86" data-end="1045.28">just like scissors and paper and it's</span> <span data-start="1045.28" data-end="1047.74">kind of similar to masking but for a</span> <span data-start="1047.74" data-end="1051.13">masking we can use images and for a CSS</span> <span data-start="1051.13" data-end="1055.299">we can all only use vector vector images</span> <span data-start="1055.299" data-end="1058.27">so paths paints basically so in clipping</span> <span

<p><span data-start="1075.76" data-end="1078.94">I did before is I had to prepare the the</span> <span data-start="1078.94" data-end="1081.04">path the shape of the of the path of the</span> <span data-start="1081.04" data-end="1083.71">plan I did an illustrator exported an</span> <span data-start="1083.71" data-end="1086.049">SVG and later applied it and clip path</span> <span data-start="1086.049" data-end="1091.2">so I to the SVG code face it and an HTML</span> <span data-start="1091.2" data-end="1094.09">between death stacks so it means that it</span> <span data-start="1094.09" data-end="1096.64">won't be generated anywhere but at like</span> <span data-start="1096.64" data-end="1099.88">the our website knows what is the</span> <span data-start="1099.88" data-end="1102.52">definition for the path and later we</span> <span data-start="1102.52" data-end="1104.559">just reference to it in CSS</span> <span data-start="1104.559" data-end="1109.61">so we've got clip path property</span> <span data-start="1109.62" data-end="1112.4">and this is how it looks in real life</span> <span data-start="1112.4" data-end="1115.71">we've got the plans I also applied some</span> <span data-start="1115.71" data-end="1119.37">background and some blend modes and if I</span> <span data-start="1119.37" data-end="1121.86">comment out the flip pass you'll see the</span> <span data-start="1121.86" data-end="1128.909">whole image so simple as that and if</span> <span data-start="1128.909" data-end="1131.4">you're not very convinced that actually</span> </p>

data-end="1246.36">predicted needed to prepare before is</span> <span data-start="1246.36" data-end="1250.5">the mask image so I I cutted it out and</span> <span data-start="1250.5" data-end="1254.07">in Photoshop and after applying a mask</span> <span data-start="1254.07" data-end="1257.61">we have the visible area so the area</span> <span data-start="1257.61"

data-end="1272.669">space and when talking about masking I'm</span> <span data-start="1272.669" data-end="1275.159">super excited about math composite so</span> <span data-start="1275.159" data-end="1278.85">mask composite lets us to combine to</span> <span data-start="1278.85" data-end="1283.049">compose many layers of mask of masks</span> <span data-start="1283.049" data-end="1286.409">image images so let's imagine we've got</span> <span data-start="1286.409" data-end="1291.45">two masks splashes and one gradient so</span> <span data-start="1291.45" data-end="1294.99">what we do is we apply two masks and</span> <span data-start="1294.99" data-end="1298.2">then we just need to define the</span> <span data-start="1298.2" data-end="1300.84">compositing mode so here it is mask</span> <span data-start="1300.84" data-end="1304.289">composite add and what's it's good to</span> <span data-start="1304.289" data-end="1306.269">remember is that the first one is called</span> <span data-start="1306.269" data-end="1308.399">the source and the second is the</span> <span data-start="1308.399"

data-end="1315.71">that we're masking we're going to mask</span> <span data-start="1315.71" data-end="1318.99">so this is the example I created and I</span> <span data-start="1318.99" data-end="1321.24">was inspired by some fashion magazines</span> <span data-start="1321.24" data-end="1323.789">and I really wanted to keep this like</span> <span data-start="1323.789" data-end="1326.61">very artistic vibe so we have the image</span> <span data-start="1326.61" data-end="1329.61">and here you can see it's actually</span> <span data-start="1329.61" data-end="1332.7">animated you can see different different</span> <span data-start="1332.7" data-end="1341">compositing modes and in this example</span> <span data-start="1341" data-end="1344.909">you're seeing that we're having two two</span> <span data-start="1344.909" data-end="1348.179">masks and if we apply only one it looks</span> <span data-start="1348.179" data-end="1350.909">like this but if we combine them and</span> <span data-start="1350.909" data-end="1352.83">actually add another image to make it</span> <span data-start="1352.83" data-end="1356.039">more collage like we can see that it</span> <span data-start="1356.039" data-end="1358.019">gives us a really interesting in fact</span> <span data-start="1358.019" data-end="1360.84">very artistic so for this one we've got</span> <span data-start="1360.84" data-end="1363.36">intersect compositing mode we can use</span> <span data-start="1363.36" data-end="1369.149">add and we can use the friend we've got</span> <span data-start="1369.149" data-end="1369.75">four of them</span> <span data-start="1369.75" data-end="1371.73">and I'm going to show you in a minute</span> <span data-start="1371.73" data-end="1375.01">and for this I also used blend modes to</span> <span data-start="1375.01" data-end="1379.63">make it like more more natural
