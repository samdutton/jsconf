<p><span data-start="41.16" data-end="45.77">I've authored a couple of books, the last two on web performance.</span> <span data-start="45.77" data-end="52.72">I'm not here to talk about myself about how the system is broke.</span> <span data-start="52.72" data-end="55.51">For example, this is my phone this morning.</span> <span data-start="55.51" data-end="60.19">It's trying to update 231 apps, okay?</span> <span data-start="60.19" data-end="67.6">So I encourage you to do the same thing, disable automatic updates and see what happens.</span> <span data-start="67.6" data-end="75">Also you've probably heard about the news in the last few months, apps currently sending</span> <span data-start="75" data-end="81.35">a lot of data to different servers, sending your data when Super League, not just on iOS</span> <span data-start="81.35" data-end="87">but also on Android, and, again, because I'm travelling a lot, I flew here through New</span> <span data-start="87" data-end="94.25">York because I had a flight cancellation, and I saw that in Manhattan, in Penn Station</span> <span data-start="94.25" data-end="100.26">in downtown Manhattan, download the app for the train station.</span> <span data-start="100.26" data-end="103.6">Do we need an app for the train station?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="103.6" data-end="112.12">If you go to the store, it's 50 megabytes for the train station app.</span> <span data-start="112.12" data-end="114.38">Reviews are pretty bad, okay?</span> <span data-start="114.38" data-end="116.6">And it's not just that app, okay.</span> <span data-start="116.6" data-end="118.45">So this is a common scenario.</span> <span data-start="118.45" data-end="121.11">We see this every day.</span> <span data-start="121.11" data-end="125.659">You're thinking well, PWAs, right?</span> <span data-start="125.659" data-end="130.92">PWAs should be the answer for a lot of these apps, okay?</span> <span data-start="130.92" data-end="134.54">That is why today I'm starting a new Twitter account.</span> <span data-start="134.54" data-end="137.069">It should be a PWA, okay?</span> <span data-start="137.069" data-end="140.38">That's for real.</span> <span data-start="140.38" data-end="143.27">[Applause].</span> <span data-start="143.27" data-end="146.17">@shouldbePWA.</span> <span data-start="146.17" data-end="151.569">They show a lot of apps out there that should be based on the web platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="151.569" data-end="154.38">There's no need for an app.</span> <span data-start="154.38" data-end="159.8">Progressive web apps, don't ask me nor a definition.</span> <span data-start="159.8" data-end="161.54">How many of you have created PWAs?</span> <span data-start="161.54" data-end="163.06">Let's see.</span> <span data-start="163.06" data-end="164.98">Around 30 per cent.</span> <span data-start="164.98" data-end="166.65">How many of you are working on the web?</span> <span data-start="166.65" data-end="168.51">Most of you, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="168.51" data-end="173.849">So it basically is the same, so why 70 per cent of you are not saying that you're creating</span> <span data-start="173.849" data-end="175.37">PWAs?</span> <span data-start="175.37" data-end="180.86">So I offer this article in Net — I authored this article in .net magazine.</span> <span data-start="180.86" data-end="194.21">I like this definition that PWA is the current — it's basically the web.</span> <span data-start="194.21" data-end="200.88">Just for the zero per cent of you if you've not heard about this, it's a web app with</span> <span data-start="200.88" data-end="206.63">service workers, and with, let's say, an optional layer that has to do with distribution, how</span> <span data-start="206.63" data-end="212.45">users will install or use the app, because installation is not mandatory, you use the</span> <span data-start="212.45" data-end="214.959">web app from the browser.</span> <span data-start="214.959" data-end="221.43">So right now, today, 81 per cent of your users are able to install a PWA from the browser</span> <span data-start="221.43" data-end="224.15">they're actually using to access your websites.</span> <span data-start="224.15" data-end="225.6">It's a lot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.6" data-end="227.77">On mobile, it's 92, okay?</span> <span data-start="227.77" data-end="230.459">On desktop, it's 69.</span> <span data-start="230.459" data-end="233.89">These numbers are getting higher every day.</span> <span data-start="233.89" data-end="236.52">So this is the support on mobile.</span> <span data-start="236.52" data-end="241.31">It works on every browser when you're in a website, you can actually install it from</span> <span data-start="241.31" data-end="243.05">your home screen.</span> <span data-start="243.05" data-end="248.16">That's the JSConf PWA, and then you have an app.</span> <span data-start="248.16" data-end="251.21">That app looks like any other app on Android, okay?</span> <span data-start="251.21" data-end="255.18">You have seen this before, probably.</span> <span data-start="255.18" data-end="257.479">So that is I think pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="257.479" data-end="259.35">It looks like any other app on Android.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.35" data-end="260.65">The same happens on iOS.</span> <span data-start="260.65" data-end="264.27">You can go to Tinder, you know that one?</span> <span data-start="264.27" data-end="271.339">Tinder is a PWA, you can go to your iPhone, go to the share sheet and the home screen,</span> <span data-start="271.339" data-end="272.55">create an icon.</span> <span data-start="272.55" data-end="276.259">You're thinking that's not a PWA, it's just a short cut to the website.</span> <span data-start="276.259" data-end="283.03">If you open that icon, you have a standalone fuel-screen experience from looks like any</span> <span data-start="283.03" data-end="284.879">other app on the iPhone.</span> <span data-start="284.879" data-end="287.34">So it's basically a PWA.</span> <span data-start="287.34" data-end="295.8">Then you have — feature phones, I have this Nokia here with me, feature phones, non-touch,</span> <span data-start="295.8" data-end="298.75">they're supporting PWAs.</span> <span data-start="298.75" data-end="299.979">But it's not just on mobile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="299.979" data-end="312.339">On desktop you can go and install Trivago, Tinder, by the way, and you have a — that</span> <span data-start="312.339" data-end="317.169">works on Windows, Chromebook, Mac and Linux.</span> <span data-start="317.169" data-end="321.229">You can open more PWAs at the same time.</span> <span data-start="321.229" data-end="327.729">We have the properly, we just need to create really, really good experiences, and today,</span> <span data-start="327.729" data-end="334.199">let's say that I can say that maybe half of the PWA s out there on R offering a good experience.</span> <span data-start="334.199" data-end="341.949">The other half are away for offering a competition like the native apps, and so we will try to</span> <span data-start="341.949" data-end="345.37">see why, and what we can do today to improve that experience.</span> <span data-start="345.37" data-end="349.069">So, talking about the app cycle, okay?</span> <span data-start="349.069" data-end="354.05">So because we are creating apps, not just websites that will appear in the browser.</span> <span data-start="354.05" data-end="360.259">So, when you open a PWA, so if the app loads like any other content.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.259" data-end="362.699">That's not, that's no surprise.</span> <span data-start="362.699" data-end="367.659">What happens when the user goes to the background such as pressing the home screen?</span> <span data-start="367.659" data-end="373.449">You have visibility change event, and there you can pause a game or an animation, you</span> <span data-start="373.449" data-end="378.5">can stop a timer, okay, because you're not in the foreground any more.</span> <span data-start="378.5" data-end="385.539">A couple of seconds later, mostly on mobile devices such as Android, the app might be</span> <span data-start="385.539" data-end="390.809">suspended, and there is a new freeze event which means your app will be in memory for</span> <span data-start="390.809" data-end="393.729">a while but you won't be executing any code.</span> <span data-start="393.729" data-end="399.229">If you want to save the state or do something, this is your last dinner.</span> <span data-start="399.229" data-end="400.789">The freeze event.</span> <span data-start="400.789" data-end="403.139">And then you go back to the app.</span> <span data-start="403.139" data-end="409.27">If you're lucky enough, the app is still in memory and now resume will be executed, and</span> <span data-start="409.27" data-end="411.889">also the visibility change again.</span> <span data-start="411.889" data-end="420.589">Let's say that, when you close the PWA, you are using an intention app like recording</span> <span data-start="420.589" data-end="427.199">a video, watching a Netflix movie, or using a 3D game, when you go back, your app was</span> <span data-start="427.199" data-end="432.83">discarded from memory, so in this case, the PWA will start from scratch like a normal</span> <span data-start="432.83" data-end="439.55">load but there is now a new boolean value that you can query that will give you true,</span> <span data-start="439.55" data-end="446.279">okay, in that case, and there you have the opportunity to load again the state, the previous</span> <span data-start="446.279" data-end="449.039">state that you saved before, okay?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="449.039" data-end="450.889">You need to start doing this.</span> <span data-start="450.889" data-end="452.969">So, what about iOS?</span> <span data-start="452.969" data-end="455.819">iOS isn't following exactly this rule.</span> <span data-start="455.819" data-end="463.009">In fact, I did a research on the life cycle of an iOS PWA and it looks like this.</span> <span data-start="463.009" data-end="472.469">So, anyway, the important part here is that here in the PWA and iOS, you can zoom in,</span> <span data-start="472.469" data-end="476.52">control, click, type on a form, so that is the current state.</span> <span data-start="476.52" data-end="484.139">When you get out of the PWA, okay, your app is current ly frozen, so, when you go back</span> <span data-start="484.139" data-end="491.279">you can see a splash, so it's like starting from a crash but the WebKit is restoring the</span> <span data-start="491.279" data-end="492.279">state.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="492.279" data-end="499.789">If you kill the app, it also restores the state, so there is no way to restart the app</span> <span data-start="499.789" data-end="501.06">from the scratch.</span> <span data-start="501.06" data-end="503.639">You can buy a new iPhone if you want!</span> <span data-start="503.639" data-end="505.979">At least you can restart the phone.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="505.979" data-end="507.83">That's a problem.</span> <span data-start="507.83" data-end="512.39">If you have an invalid state, there's no way to get out of that.</span> <span data-start="512.39" data-end="519.029">It's a good idea on iOS at least to provide a reload action within the UI at least until</span> <span data-start="519.029" data-end="520.3">Apple changes this.</span> <span data-start="520.3" data-end="523.66">Also, you can provide full navigation like a back button.</span> <span data-start="523.66" data-end="533.49">We have gestures like swipe to go back but it's a good idea to be sure you want for this.</span> <span data-start="533.49" data-end="536.82">So what about the resources?</span> <span data-start="536.82" data-end="542.9">Worker is the one that is storing and saving, and serving those files.</span> <span data-start="542.9" data-end="544.02">So — service worker.</span> <span data-start="544.02" data-end="547.56">The problem is that there are situations where you can find this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="547.56" data-end="555.51">You open up an app, and Uber in this case, Chrome, is saying I don't have the files.</span> <span data-start="555.51" data-end="557.99">It's saying how is that possible?</span> <span data-start="557.99" data-end="563.4">Because the browser can't delete the files if there is a storage pressure, so no more</span> <span data-start="563.4" data-end="569.82">space on that device, unless you request for persistent storage, so this is something you</span> <span data-start="569.82" data-end="572.58">need to do explicitly, right?</span> <span data-start="572.58" data-end="580.61">It's a promise API, so you just ask for persistent storage so your files will be there.</span> <span data-start="580.61" data-end="583.17">Now let's move to another topic.</span> <span data-start="583.17" data-end="587.21">This is programme aggressive experience.</span> <span data-start="587.21" data-end="591.44">Star, we have been creating one app for all.</span> <span data-start="591.44" data-end="604.34">So create an app, need JS, Vue, Angular, whatever, we have a lot of devices, high-end 15s, low-end</span> <span data-start="604.34" data-end="610.65">phones, feature phones that might be running your app, and we have different bandwidth</span> <span data-start="610.65" data-end="613.39">and latencies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="613.39" data-end="618.53">I'm here with a 4G device on roaming, and it looks like a slow 3G, okay?</span> <span data-start="618.53" data-end="626.62">I know, so maybe you have a Samsung, S10 with the best LTE plus, plus super ultra but four</span> <span data-start="626.62" data-end="627.94">per cent of battery.</span> <span data-start="627.94" data-end="635.38">I need something from your web app but I don't want you to load those four megabytes of JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="635.38" data-end="639.71">so what I'm saying is maybe we need to copy something from YouTube?</span> <span data-start="639.71" data-end="643.04">It has a model for users.</span> <span data-start="643.04" data-end="648.51">It's trying to guess the best possible experience for that user, and it is on quality.</span> <span data-start="648.51" data-end="649.9">The user can change that.</span> <span data-start="649.9" data-end="658.44">Why can't we do the same on our PWA, there are a lot that those about the context, the</span> <span data-start="658.44" data-end="666.96">perform servers, device memory API, so you can gather information that scenario so you</span> <span data-start="666.96" data-end="668.36">can make some decisions.</span> <span data-start="668.36" data-end="672.14">Also, there is a reporting API available today.</span> <span data-start="672.14" data-end="678.17">It's an HTTP header where you send an end point or URL and the browser will send you</span> <span data-start="678.17" data-end="685.87">for that particular user with real user metrics information reports about performance issues.</span> <span data-start="685.87" data-end="690.38">On that particular advice, on that particular network, so then you can make decisions to</span> <span data-start="690.38" data-end="696.46">keep a consistent experience, because we want to have a consistent experience, such as changing</span> <span data-start="696.46" data-end="703.74">the service worker cache policy based on this, SSR, client-side rendering, you can switch</span> <span data-start="703.74" data-end="710.1">based on the scenario, reducing the amount of loaded data, and many other tricks that</span> <span data-start="710.1" data-end="711.14">you can apply.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="711.14" data-end="717.47">So, we want to offer a good experience for every user.</span> <span data-start="717.47" data-end="721.75">We are creating PWAs for a real operating system.</span> <span data-start="721.75" data-end="727.56">So, we need some kind of platform integration, so we need to do something else compared with</span> <span data-start="727.56" data-end="729.1">a normal website.</span> <span data-start="729.1" data-end="736.24">So, for example, web authentication is really a good example of how you can improve this</span> <span data-start="736.24" data-end="737.24">quickly.</span> <span data-start="737.24" data-end="744.42">Today, for example .. it's a PWA where you can actually log in pretty quickly with your</span> <span data-start="744.42" data-end="746.31">current session on Android.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="746.31" data-end="752.43">I didn't have an account on that website before, but with one click, I'm in, okay?</span> <span data-start="752.43" data-end="754.85">This is coming on Safari as well.</span> <span data-start="754.85" data-end="760.41">Web share, you're creating an app that is standalone, so full screen, there is no browser</span> <span data-start="760.41" data-end="764.42">UI, so how can I get out of my PWA?</span> <span data-start="764.42" data-end="768.09">How can I get my content out of my PWA?</span> <span data-start="768.09" data-end="775.67">We can share the content with a very simple API available right now on iOS, Android, and</span> <span data-start="775.67" data-end="777.91">some desk tomorrow operating systems.</span> <span data-start="777.91" data-end="785.14">For example, I'm here on Twitter on iOS, Twitter PWA, not the native app, and you can just</span> <span data-start="785.14" data-end="786.53">share from there.</span> <span data-start="786.53" data-end="791.31">It opens the native share dialogue, so I think that's pretty cool.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="847.76" data-end="855.43">It says it was installed from the Play Store which is false, because it's signed by the</span> <span data-start="855.43" data-end="861.67">Play Store, and that creates a good first-palace experience for your Android cruisers.</span> <span data-start="861.67" data-end="862.68">The same happens on Samsung.</span> <span data-start="862.68" data-end="869.279">If you're on a Samsung device and using the internet browser, in this case, a web APK</span> <span data-start="869.279" data-end="871.3">signed by Samsung apps.</span> <span data-start="871.3" data-end="877.18">This is interesting because you're now creating Android-native apps from an Android operating</span> <span data-start="877.18" data-end="878.79">system point of view.</span> <span data-start="878.79" data-end="887.32">Talking about desktop, today, on desktop, you can do multi-window — that is Google drive</span> <span data-start="887.32" data-end="888.32">on desktop.</span> <span data-start="888.32" data-end="889.48">It's a PWA.</span> <span data-start="889.48" data-end="892.3">You can open your window.</span> <span data-start="892.3" data-end="894.99">So, it's a multi-window world.</span> <span data-start="894.99" data-end="901.02">You can say on the web, it's multi-tab, but you need to know what you're going to do with</span> <span data-start="901.02" data-end="902.02">this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="902.02" data-end="906.72">Now the user can have several apps open.</span> <span data-start="906.72" data-end="912.6">You can use the service worker, for example, in the message API to make some kind of control,</span> <span data-start="912.6" data-end="921.12">and future looks really promising, so let me show you an early mock on how tab on PWAs</span> <span data-start="921.12" data-end="925.55">might look like later, might be this year, I don't know.</span> <span data-start="925.55" data-end="933.49">This is it from the last Google IO where you can see it's your app with several tabs inside.</span> <span data-start="933.49" data-end="937.29">We have a lot of new challenges on the way.</span> <span data-start="937.29" data-end="942.86">Coming back to the iOS, our last platform to talk about, let me tell you this: so, if</span> <span data-start="942.86" data-end="953.82">you Google PWAs on iOS, the first, the second, and articles there are my articles, okay?</span> <span data-start="953.82" data-end="958.7">And the snippet you see there, it's also coming from one of my articles.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="958.7" data-end="963.71">There is no documentation at all from Apple or from the WebKit team.</span> <span data-start="963.71" data-end="970.56">They are supporting partially, totally, or the technologies, but there is no documentation,</span> <span data-start="970.56" data-end="971.56">okay?</span> <span data-start="971.56" data-end="978.68">You need to be careful, test a lot, and add some metadata that is required for an iOS</span> <span data-start="978.68" data-end="979.68">PWA.</span> <span data-start="979.68" data-end="985.53">Let me tell you one thing only: Apple, shame on you, right?</span> <span data-start="985.53" data-end="988.4">Because this is a problem that we have as a community.</span> <span data-start="988.4" data-end="990.98">So, installation experience.</span> <span data-start="990.98" data-end="993.94">So, we are creating apps, okay?</span> <span data-start="993.94" data-end="996.25">So we want to create apps.</span> <span data-start="996.25" data-end="999.96">So we need to improve how users will install our app.</span> <span data-start="999.96" data-end="1004.57">First, because most users will never know that there is an actual home screen and an</span> <span data-start="1004.57" data-end="1010.24">install menu with three little dots, menu in the browser.</span> <span data-start="1010.24" data-end="1016.32">We manage on that, we have this web app service worker and the distribution rings here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1016.32" data-end="1017.32">I did this on purpose.</span> <span data-start="1017.32" data-end="1023.089">I didn't set web app manifest on the red ring because I don't think it's the only one.</span> <span data-start="1023.089" data-end="1027.419">Web app manifest is one of the key aspects of the PWA, of course.</span> <span data-start="1027.419" data-end="1031.9">It is the one that will give you on desktop button in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="1031.9" data-end="1042.23">It is giving you the mini info bar on Android, and on other browsers, it would give you several</span> <span data-start="1042.23" data-end="1050.11">budgets when you are PWA, you're passing the PWA criteria been but I don't think this is</span> <span data-start="1050.11" data-end="1054">the only important part on a PWA.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1054" data-end="1062.179">You must provide your own install button within your UI, within your menu, whenever you feel</span> <span data-start="1062.179" data-end="1067.509">it's the moment to offer the user installation, you can actually add your own install button.</span> <span data-start="1067.509" data-end="1071.499">So it is simple but weird, okay?</span> <span data-start="1071.499" data-end="1074.58">So you need to listen for a new event before installing prompt.</span> <span data-start="1074.58" data-end="1080.779">When the browser thinks that you're passing a PWA criteria, it will fire that event, so</span> <span data-start="1080.779" data-end="1087.179">you need to basically prevent default first, just to avoid the browser to show its own</span> <span data-start="1087.179" data-end="1093.029">banner, and then you want to save that argument that you receive for later usage.</span> <span data-start="1093.029" data-end="1097.49">And then when the user clicks on that button, you will just call prompt, okay?</span> <span data-start="1097.49" data-end="1099.35">So that is roughly how it worked.</span> <span data-start="1099.35" data-end="1105.149">You can create your own button that will trigger the native dialogue on desktop and on Android</span> <span data-start="1105.149" data-end="1106.149">devices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1106.149" data-end="1113.44">So apart from web app manifests already mentioned, you need to add iOS metadata, and something</span> <span data-start="1113.44" data-end="1123.11">that it's not completely new, but for most web developers, it's new: an app launcher.</span> <span data-start="1123.11" data-end="1128.73">It's a native package that will trigger a PWA.</span> <span data-start="1128.73" data-end="1135.669">I'm not talking about a hybrid like Cordoba, I'm talking about a launcher that opens the</span> <span data-start="1135.669" data-end="1139.799">browser in a special full-screen standalone mode.</span> <span data-start="1139.799" data-end="1146.71">We're not patching our files, our HTML and JavaScript files, we're not packaging those</span> <span data-start="1146.71" data-end="1153.019">files, we're just launching the PWA and the service worker will take care of the loading</span> <span data-start="1153.019" data-end="1154.019">device.</span> <span data-start="1154.019" data-end="1159.44">So, for windows, we can create an APPX — that's the format available — and then you can go</span> <span data-start="1159.44" data-end="1166.029">to the Microsoft Store for this Nokia device.</span> <span data-start="1166.029" data-end="1174.26">You can create a cash generator — there are free tools that will help you in the creation</span> <span data-start="1174.26" data-end="1178.36">of this — so, again, you still have your web app, you still have your service workers.</span> <span data-start="1178.36" data-end="1183.149">We're talking about the outer ring — just that.</span> <span data-start="1183.149" data-end="1187.779">You need to do something else, not just the web manifest for these — for these operating</span> <span data-start="1187.779" data-end="1188.779">systems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1188.779" data-end="1195.45">But you're thinking, "Well, what about Play Store?</span> <span data-start="1195.45" data-end="1197.35">What about Android?."</span> <span data-start="1197.35" data-end="1203.76">Let me give you an example, an e-commerce site from the US where you can buy flowers.</span> <span data-start="1203.76" data-end="1206.029">They created a really good PWA.</span> <span data-start="1206.029" data-end="1210.919">There were even mentioned in the last Google IO keynote.</span> <span data-start="1210.919" data-end="1221.74">They also used to have a native review, was kind of okay.</span> <span data-start="1221.74" data-end="1230.651">Well [microphone breaking up] Play Store today, you go to trending, then the fifth one, it's</span> <span data-start="1230.651" data-end="1238.62">800 Flowers, and you can install the app from the Play Store.</span> <span data-start="1238.62" data-end="1243.799">That app is basically a PWA, okay?</span> <span data-start="1243.799" data-end="1245.859">It's their PWA.</span> <span data-start="1245.859" data-end="1251.69">So now they have replaced their native app with a PWA.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1251.69" data-end="1258.029">This is now possible, so you can publish new apps and PWAs, or if you have on your company</span> <span data-start="1258.029" data-end="1266.97">crappy Android native app, a package ID, upload new versions, and all the users will receive</span> <span data-start="1266.97" data-end="1269.46">now the PWA version.</span> <span data-start="1269.46" data-end="1274.559">From now on, you don't need to upload any more updates because you just change the files</span> <span data-start="1274.559" data-end="1275.559">on your server.</span> <span data-start="1275.559" data-end="1279.799">You don't need to package new APKs.</span> <span data-start="1279.799" data-end="1282.47">So this is thanks to trusted web activities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1282.47" data-end="1288.22">There is something new available on Android with Chrome, maybe it's going to appear with</span> <span data-start="1288.22" data-end="1289.299">other browsers as well.</span> <span data-start="1289.299" data-end="1295.23">So far, it's only on Chrome in a will let you compile your own Android app, need to</span> <span data-start="1295.23" data-end="1297.489">use Android Studio, okay?</span> <span data-start="1297.489" data-end="1303.039">It's one line of code that you need to set that is basically your URL.</span> <span data-start="1303.039" data-end="1310.419">You need to show you're the owner of that URL, and, when you do that, you set the icon,</span> <span data-start="1310.419" data-end="1313.989">the URL, and you go to the Play Store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1313.989" data-end="1318.95">So you can actually today publish PWAs in the Play Store, okay?</span> <span data-start="1318.95" data-end="1320.45">So, what about iOS?</span> <span data-start="1320.45" data-end="1322.869">Can we do something for iOS?</span> <span data-start="1322.869" data-end="1325.299">Probably you're thinking no?</span> <span data-start="1325.299" data-end="1329.36">. Let me tell you I found something, not what you're expecting anyway.</span> <span data-start="1329.36" data-end="1339.46">I found a tool called configurator where you can actually set web clips for full screen.</span> <span data-start="1339.46" data-end="1342.929">That full screen thing there that is basically a PWA.</span> <span data-start="1342.929" data-end="1349.48">This creates a mobile config file that you can serve on Safari or website and send by</span> <span data-start="1349.48" data-end="1350.48">email.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1350.48" data-end="1357.309">If the user accepts that configuration file .. icons.</span> <span data-start="1357.309" data-end="1359.7">This is for enterprise distribution?</span> <span data-start="1359.7" data-end="1362.989">It's not for end-users.</span> <span data-start="1362.989" data-end="1369.64">For enterprise distribution, this is one way that you have today to distribute your PWAs.</span> <span data-start="1369.64" data-end="1375.259">One tool that is cool and interesting that you could use today to create these packages</span> <span data-start="1375.259" data-end="1381.059">because we are web developers, Android studios is there, it's kind of tricky to understand</span> <span data-start="1381.059" data-end="1386.669">Android Studio and how it works, PWA builder is a free tool from Microsoft that will help</span> <span data-start="1386.669" data-end="1389.649">you create all these packages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1389.649" data-end="1400.309">If you already have a PWA, it will create the AP KFOR the play store, the APPX or Microsoft</span> <span data-start="1400.309" data-end="1404.95">Store, and it will even create you a version for the iOS app store.</span> <span data-start="1404.95" data-end="1406.399">Using that case the web use.</span> <span data-start="1406.399" data-end="1410.44">It will be like a hybrid for iOS for the app store.</span> <span data-start="1410.44" data-end="1414.149">So we can distribute apps in the store.</span> <span data-start="1414.149" data-end="1417.24">But you're thinking but we are the web, we should not be in the store.</span> <span data-start="1417.24" data-end="1420.49">That's a different discussion but, from a business point of view, it's a good idea to</span> <span data-start="1420.49" data-end="1421.86">be there.</span> <span data-start="1421.86" data-end="1424.429">But we need to be careful.</span> <span data-start="1424.429" data-end="1427.159">Because not every app can be in the store.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1427.159" data-end="1434.47">For example, there is a PWA today that I'm not sure if you've heard about, that icon,</span> <span data-start="1434.47" data-end="1438.659">how many of you know what that icon is?</span> <span data-start="1438.659" data-end="1440.09">Have one here.</span> <span data-start="1440.09" data-end="1444.149">Well, that is YouPorn.</span> <span data-start="1444.149" data-end="1449.07">They have a PWA, and of course they cannot be in the store, okay?</span> <span data-start="1449.07" data-end="1455.789">Because the store has some rules, and you need to check those rules.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1455.789" data-end="1460.139">You cannot publish private apps, apps for your employee, for example.</span> <span data-start="1460.139" data-end="1465.889">You cannot create apps using PayPal or other mechanisms to sell content, so you need to</span> <span data-start="1465.889" data-end="1469.359">check those rules, okay.</span> <span data-start="1469.359" data-end="1476.33">So the modern PWA cheat sheet, we have seen basic PWA support that we need to add, and</span> <span data-start="1476.33" data-end="1479.249">then understand the live cycle.</span> <span data-start="1479.249" data-end="1485.73">Progressive experience, not the same app for all the users, and then platform integration,</span> <span data-start="1485.73" data-end="1491.399">we need to integrate with every platform, bugs, hacks, we need to do unfortunately.</span> <span data-start="1491.399" data-end="1497.269">Then we need to improve installation experience, create the install button and also publishing</span> <span data-start="1497.269" data-end="1498.769">in the store, okay?</span> <span data-start="1498.769" data-end="1505.359">So this is for me what you need to do today to create a really good PWA, okay?</span> <span data-start="1505.359" data-end="1508.639">That is all.</span> <span data-start="1508.639" data-end="1510.83">Thank you!</span> </p>
