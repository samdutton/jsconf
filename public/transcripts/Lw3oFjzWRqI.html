<p><span data-start="938.82" data-end="944.01">XMPP but what we did here was actually</span> <span data-start="944.01" data-end="945.75">kind of an interesting mixture of the</span> <span data-start="945.75" data-end="949.2">two so XMPP is fantastic as an external</span> <span data-start="949.2" data-end="950.58">API right because there's all these</span> <span data-start="950.58" data-end="953.34">libraries out there that that can use it</span> <span data-start="953.34" data-end="955.74">and for say you want to write an iphone</span> <span data-start="955.74" data-end="957.17">app to go along with your application</span> <span data-start="957.17" data-end="961.14">you need to provide that external API if</span> <span data-start="961.14" data-end="963.12">all you have those models living in</span> <span data-start="963.12" data-end="966.78">memory and note it's really hard to kind</span> <span data-start="966.78" data-end="968.64">of give access to that and some kind of</span> <span data-start="968.64" data-end="970.77">predictable manner to some other client</span> <span data-start="970.77" data-end="973.14">and you could write some custom custom</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="973.14" data-end="976.98">HTTP API or whatever but so anyways what</span> <span data-start="976.98" data-end="980.19">we ended up doing here is basically in</span> <span data-start="980.19" data-end="981.75">this particular use case we just add</span> <span data-start="981.75" data-end="983.04">this little chat bar at the bottom and</span> <span data-start="983.04" data-end="986.1">if somebody wants to go you know open a</span> <span data-start="986.1" data-end="988.17">new tab we don't want to have to</span> <span data-start="988.17" data-end="990.21">reconnect that with xmpp again so what</span> <span data-start="990.21" data-end="992.76">we did is just maintain an XMPP</span> <span data-start="992.76" data-end="995.1">connection on the server for each client</span> <span data-start="995.1" data-end="997.17">and then everything else is being sent</span> <span data-start="997.17" data-end="999.9">and synchronized to through capsule so</span> <span data-start="999.9" data-end="1002.27">as a result you open a new tab it's</span> <span data-start="1002.27" data-end="1004.55">immediately there it's way faster to</span> <span data-start="1004.55" data-end="1006.38">reconnect that way than having to</span> <span data-start="1006.38" data-end="1009.44">re-establish that XMPP connection so</span> <span data-start="1009.44" data-end="1010.82">that's just one of the things we did</span> <span data-start="1010.82" data-end="1014.45">with it um another thing that we kind of</span> <span data-start="1014.45" data-end="1016.28">a mess around with is this this little</span> <span data-start="1016.28" data-end="1018.65">app called and bang and it's a</span> <span data-start="1018.65" data-end="1020.57">collaboration app and what we're doing</span> <span data-start="1020.57" data-end="1023.26">here is we've got our entire team is</span> <span data-start="1023.26" data-end="1027.77">like 10 of us and so here you here we</span> <span data-start="1027.77" data-end="1029.839">have a shared team state and then</span> <span data-start="1029.839" data-end="1032.42">members live within that so the so your</span> <span data-start="1032.42" data-end="1034.819">your route state for the app is actually</span> <span data-start="1034.819" data-end="1038.3">the team and then each user is a member</span> <span data-start="1038.3" data-end="1040.49">of the team as you know it's somewhere</span> <span data-start="1040.49" data-end="1043.43">down on the tree so what happens is as</span> <span data-start="1043.43" data-end="1045.11">you make changes to your tasks and</span> <span data-start="1045.11" data-end="1048.56">whatnot um it just gets propagated to</span> <span data-start="1048.56" data-end="1052.43">the rest of the team the and and it's</span> <span data-start="1052.43" data-end="1054.89">surprisingly quick even if you even if</span> <span data-start="1054.89" data-end="1055.46">you decide</span> <span data-start="1055.46" data-end="1056.63">you're going to set this stuff on the</span> <span data-start="1056.63" data-end="1058.73">server initially and then wait for the</span> <span data-start="1058.73" data-end="1061.01">change to come back it's surprisingly</span> <span data-start="1061.01" data-end="1062.539">responsive if you're using WebSockets</span> <span data-start="1062.539" data-end="1063.62">see if you had a decent internet</span> <span data-start="1063.62" data-end="1067.7">connection so I was going to try to do a</span> <span data-start="1067.7" data-end="1069.71">little demo but I don't know how big the</span> <span data-start="1069.71" data-end="1074.99">screen is here but I mean just as an</span> <span data-start="1074.99" data-end="1076.61">example of something you can do with it</span> <span data-start="1076.61" data-end="1078.529">right so and I don't even have the</span> <span data-start="1078.529" data-end="1079.669">internet connection going here but</span> <span data-start="1079.669" data-end="1081.919">basically so you this whole thing is uh</span> <span data-start="1081.919" data-end="1084.919">is keyboard control too so you can just</span> <span data-start="1084.919" data-end="1087.409">add like you know if I add a new task</span> <span data-start="1087.409" data-end="1090.649">here it's actually what it's doing is</span> <span data-start="1090.649" data-end="1092.929">it's sending to the server saying you</span> <span data-start="1092.929" data-end="1095">know here's an ad event it's getting the</span> <span data-start="1095" data-end="1096.74">change response it's getting the the</span> <span data-start="1096.74" data-end="1100.1">addy event back and and then the view is</span> <span data-start="1100.1" data-end="1101.87">responding to that and if we had</span> <span data-start="1101.87" data-end="1107.58">multiple windows open of the same thing</span> <span data-start="1107.59" data-end="1109.94">you know the changes all happen</span> <span data-start="1109.94" data-end="1111.62">simultaneously right so it obviously</span> <span data-start="1111.62" data-end="1113.51">we've got some CSS issues going on here</span> <span data-start="1113.51" data-end="1117.35">but the fact is I mean everything is</span> <span data-start="1117.35" data-end="1119.24">simultaneous it's super fast it's super</span> <span data-start="1119.24" data-end="1121.13">easy to work with the truth is all you</span> <span data-start="1121.13" data-end="1124.19">got to do is just modify the state I</span> <span data-start="1124.19" data-end="1125.63">mean you're just setting you're just</span> <span data-start="1125.63" data-end="1127.309">setting values on this shared state and</span> <span data-start="1127.309" data-end="1128.84">everything else just kind of propagates</span> <span data-start="1128.84" data-end="1131.72">and takes care of itself we are</span> <span data-start="1131.72" data-end="1135.08">definitely doing some I mean some of the</span> <span data-start="1135.08" data-end="1136.64">obvious some of the obvious problems</span> <span data-start="1136.64" data-end="1138.559">here are persistence and scaling and</span> <span data-start="1138.559" data-end="1140.33">everything else because if you're going</span> <span data-start="1140.33" data-end="1142.039">to have to keep the entire application</span> <span data-start="1142.039" data-end="1144.919">state in memory on the server there's</span> <span data-start="1144.919" data-end="1147.679">some challenges there so we're working</span> <span data-start="1147.679" data-end="1153.039">on actually my coworker fritzy here is a</span> <span data-start="1153.039" data-end="1157.76">he's on the xsf Council of the XMPP only</span> <span data-start="1157.76" data-end="1159.83">the XMPP standards foundation Council</span> <span data-start="1159.83" data-end="1163.52">and you know so he's totally an XMPP guy</span> <span data-start="1163.52" data-end="1167.029">and what he's been looking at is</span> <span data-start="1167.029" data-end="1171.32">basically writing using Redis as kind of</span> <span data-start="1171.32" data-end="1175.19">a shared memory for for the types of</span> <span data-start="1175.19" data-end="1177.32">applications so basically your register</span> <span data-start="1177.32" data-end="1179.299">function that I called here would we</span> <span data-start="1179.299" data-end="1182.299">basically set up a feed-in when he's</span> <span data-start="1182.299" data-end="1186.289">calling thou'lt j/s and then you can use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.289" data-end="1188.29">Redis is clustering to just</span> <span data-start="1188.29" data-end="1189.31">I mean you can just tilt those as many</span> <span data-start="1189.31" data-end="1192.94">servers as you need to so and then you</span> <span data-start="1192.94" data-end="1196.87">know pub/sub events do that instead the</span> <span data-start="1196.87" data-end="1198.31">there's that I mean there's definitely</span> <span data-start="1198.31" data-end="1202.03">some other some other challenges here as</span> <span data-start="1202.03" data-end="1205.03">far as you know in the case of the team</span> <span data-start="1205.03" data-end="1206.95">here you can't just have one view that</span> <span data-start="1206.95" data-end="1209.02">responds to the same model for everybody</span> <span data-start="1209.02" data-end="1211.09">because you want every every member of</span> <span data-start="1211.09" data-end="1213.61">the team to have you know their view of</span> <span data-start="1213.61" data-end="1217.42">that so what we're doing is instead of</span> <span data-start="1217.42" data-end="1219.48">trying to I messed around a lot with in</span> <span data-start="1219.48" data-end="1222.82">gear most channels implementation think</span> <span data-start="1222.82" data-end="1223.87">would have been interesting the</span> <span data-start="1223.87" data-end="1225.82">multiplexing because then you could have</span> <span data-start="1225.82" data-end="1227.26">a team channel and you could have your</span> <span data-start="1227.26" data-end="1230.89">own channel but you know so what we're</span> <span data-start="1230.89" data-end="1232.99">doing is basically the members are</span> <span data-start="1232.99" data-end="1235.42">further down the tree but the view just</span> <span data-start="1235.42" data-end="1239.26">identifies you know this user is X user</span> <span data-start="1239.26" data-end="1242.29">and then so as a result anything that's</span> <span data-start="1242.29" data-end="1244.54">specific to that user is getting set as</span> <span data-start="1244.54" data-end="1246.7">a property of that users model in the</span> <span data-start="1246.7" data-end="1248.89">team so the entire team state is still</span> <span data-start="1248.89" data-end="1253.24">sink but the you know your view your</span> <span data-start="1253.24" data-end="1255.1">view just shows the correct one based on</span> <span data-start="1255.1" data-end="1259">session ID of that user so the other</span> <span data-start="1259" data-end="1261.16">thing is like I said providing external</span> <span data-start="1261.16" data-end="1263.59">api's and one of the things that that</span> <span data-start="1263.59" data-end="1266.37">thunk does is basically you can have</span> <span data-start="1266.37" data-end="1268.78">thunk is just a contract system with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1268.78" data-end="1271.21">Reddit and so you could actually have</span> <span data-start="1271.21" data-end="1274">just an XMPP interface to thunk that</span> <span data-start="1274" data-end="1275.98">just uses pub/sub you could have it</span> <span data-start="1275.98" data-end="1277.93">right you know RSS or atom feeds or</span> <span data-start="1277.93" data-end="1281.17">whatever so there's definitely some</span> <span data-start="1281.17" data-end="1283.57">stuff there that's still missing that</span> <span data-start="1283.57" data-end="1286.69">we're working on but just you know not</span> <span data-start="1286.69" data-end="1288.43">like here's how you should do real-time</span> <span data-start="1288.43" data-end="1290.44">just kind of showing what we've been</span> <span data-start="1290.44" data-end="1292.09">doing what we midpoint around with and</span> <span data-start="1292.09" data-end="1294.19">kind of what we found hopefully</span> <span data-start="1294.19" data-end="1296.5">hopefully that's useful to you guys and</span> <span data-start="1296.5" data-end="1298.8">anybody who has questions or anything</span> <span data-start="1298.8" data-end="1305.669">just any questions</span> <span data-start="1305.679" data-end="1313.789">now Jas yeah oh yeah I haven't spent a</span> <span data-start="1313.789" data-end="1315.2">lot of time looking at now Jas my</span> <span data-start="1315.2" data-end="1317.179">impression is that basically if you you</span> <span data-start="1317.179" data-end="1319.7">have this kind of magic object and if</span> <span data-start="1319.7" data-end="1322.1">you create a function on the client that</span> <span data-start="1322.1" data-end="1325.629">function becomes available on the server</span> <span data-start="1325.629" data-end="1328.879">which is interesting and that's that I</span> <span data-start="1328.879" data-end="1330.35">mean that's that's cool it's just it's</span> <span data-start="1330.35" data-end="1332.029">just an infection on top of socket i/o</span> <span data-start="1332.029" data-end="1335.69">basically right but yeah that would be</span> <span data-start="1335.69" data-end="1337.609">another interesting architecture choice</span> <span data-start="1337.609" data-end="1340.97">but I mean you could totally do that</span> <span data-start="1340.97" data-end="1343.19">anyways i mean i i've got a method in</span> <span data-start="1343.19" data-end="1344.72">here for just you know call this method</span> <span data-start="1344.72" data-end="1347.989">on this model on the server does</span> <span data-start="1347.989" data-end="1350.779">basically the same thing so it's cool I</span> <span data-start="1350.779" data-end="1356.34">mean I I haven't played with it a lot</span> <span data-start="1356.35" data-end="1365.12">other questions</span> <span data-start="1365.13" data-end="1369.6">oh yeah so I think I have one last slide</span> <span data-start="1369.6" data-end="1372.93">yeah okay so capsule capsule Jas is kind</span> <span data-start="1372.93" data-end="1374.97">of what what I wrote that it that adds</span> <span data-start="1374.97" data-end="1377.64">those features to backbone I'd love to</span> <span data-start="1377.64" data-end="1379.35">get more feedback on that I know it's</span> <span data-start="1379.35" data-end="1380.58">certainly not perfect and i know this</span> <span data-start="1380.58" data-end="1382.85">approach still has the shortcomings but</span> <span data-start="1382.85" data-end="1384.6">we're going to keep playing with an</span> <span data-start="1384.6" data-end="1388.02">experimental see what we can do and also</span> <span data-start="1388.02" data-end="1389.88">if any guys are interested in messing</span> <span data-start="1389.88" data-end="1392.94">around with an bang as a little pre</span> <span data-start="1392.94" data-end="1395.07">alpha something or other i just hit me</span> <span data-start="1395.07" data-end="1396.48">up on Twitter and I can get some invites</span> <span data-start="1396.48" data-end="1397.8">sent out because we've got that almost</span> <span data-start="1397.8" data-end="1400.11">we're almost ready to publish that stuff</span> <span data-start="1400.11" data-end="1401.94">so it's kind of a that way you can at</span> <span data-start="1401.94" data-end="1403.2">least have something that you can play</span> <span data-start="1403.2" data-end="1406.95">with and see how it works as well but</span> <span data-start="1406.95" data-end="1408.99">yeah and then just some other things</span> <span data-start="1408.99" data-end="1413.73">here one of the at jas conf which I</span> <span data-start="1413.73" data-end="1415.92">wasn't there at but funk unit is it</span> <span data-start="1415.92" data-end="1417.48">seems like a really way cool way to test</span> <span data-start="1417.48" data-end="1419.79">these types of apps because basically</span> <span data-start="1419.79" data-end="1424.44">you can just run basically it's built on</span> <span data-start="1424.44" data-end="1426.6">top of queue unit which is the jQuery</span> <span data-start="1426.6" data-end="1431.67">testing thing but they and you can bail</span> <span data-start="1431.67" data-end="1433.35">owes your app open an iframe and says</span> <span data-start="1433.35" data-end="1435.21">hey click this button do this thing and</span> <span data-start="1435.21" data-end="1436.95">make sure that this you know wait for</span> <span data-start="1436.95" data-end="1438.3">this thing to become visible kind of</span> <span data-start="1438.3" data-end="1439.86">thing and it's a really awesome way to</span> <span data-start="1439.86" data-end="1441.99">test these types of that but just as a</span> <span data-start="1441.99" data-end="1445.59">little side note so well thank you very</span> </p>
