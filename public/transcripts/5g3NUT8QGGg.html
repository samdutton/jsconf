is</span> <span data-start="680.35" data-end="682.94">preferentially treated in our system so</span> <span data-start="682.94" data-end="686.39">that we can get this motion between you</span> <span

data-start="717.62" data-end="718.579">and that</span> <span data-start="718.579" data-end="721.069">kind of the key to everything is just by</span> <span data-start="721.069"

data-end="727.129">something is in space and that's kind of</span> <span data-start="727.129" data-end="729.619">the crux of the API is that you are</span> <span data-start="729.619" data-end="733.129">taking these you know if if a point if a</span> <span data-start="733.129" data-end="734.509">node has a point in space that</span> <span data-start="734.509" data-end="736.399">determines where it is and it has the</span> <span data-start="736.399" data-end="738.499">size so that gives it pretty much a cube</span> <span data-start="738.499" data-end="740.119">you're essentially positioning these</span> <span data-start="740.119" data-end="742.129">cubes in space to make your application</span> <span data-start="742.129" data-end="744.799">and the only thing left to do from that</span> <span data-start="744.799" data-end="748.73">point is we need to add the ability to</span> <span data-start="748.73" data-end="751.489">draw so the idea is that we have these</span> <span data-start="751.489" data-end="753.29">renderable components that attach onto</span> <span data-start="753.29" data-end="756.499">nodes and again nodes are defined as a</span> <span data-start="756.499" data-end="758.689">point in space a cube so if we just give</span> <span data-start="758.689" data-end="760.519">the node the ability to understand how</span> <span data-start="760.519" data-end="762.319">to draw or send information on how to</span> <span data-start="762.319" data-end="765.47">draw then we're kind of all set so if we</span> <span data-start="765.47" data-end="767.019">take a look at this example right here</span> <span data-start="767.019" data-end="769.22">you can see like the first line we're</span> <span data-start="769.22" data-end="770.42">going to create our scene and we're</span> <span data-start="770.42" data-end="772.399">going to add a brand new node and then</span> <span data-start="772.399" data-end="773.48">the next few lines we're going to</span> <span data-start="773.48" data-end="774.739">position the node we're going to say all</span> <span data-start="774.739" data-end="777.049">right you're 250 pixels by 250 pixels by</span> <span data-start="777.049" data-end="779.029">250 pixels we're going to move you to</span> <span data-start="779.029" data-end="780.829">the center of your parent your center is</span> <span data-start="780.829" data-end="782.689">going to be at that point and your</span> <span data-start="782.689" data-end="784.429">origin for your rotations is going to be</span> <span data-start="784.429" data-end="788.119">your Center so and then we also attach a</span> <span data-start="788.119" data-end="789.319">component that's responsible for</span> <span data-start="789.319" data-end="791.48">rotating the thing around the y-axis as</span> <span data-start="791.48" data-end="793.79">time moves on so this is all the code to</span> <span data-start="793.79" data-end="795.769">set up this like fictitious cube in</span> <span data-start="795.769" data-end="798.019">space rotating and that's all we need to</span> <span data-start="798.019" data-end="799.819">do and now from here what we can do is</span> <span data-start="799.819" data-end="801.649">we can attach components to these nodes</span> <span data-start="801.649" data-end="804.649">to give them the ability to draw so here</span> <span data-start="804.649" data-end="806.66">we have this node that's spinning this</span> <span data-start="806.66" data-end="808.1">like invisible node spinning in space</span> <span data-start="808.1" data-end="809.209">and we're going to say all right I'm</span> <span data-start="809.209" data-end="810.799">going to add a Dom element to it and</span> <span data-start="810.799" data-end="812.179">it's going to have a background color of</span> <span data-start="812.179" data-end="814.459">red and I'm going to add a mesh to it</span> <span data-start="814.459" data-end="816.319">and the meshes geometry is going to be a</span> <span data-start="816.319" data-end="818.72">sphere so what this ends up looking like</span> <span data-start="818.72" data-end="822.319">is exactly kind of what we would think</span> <span data-start="822.319" data-end="823.999">you know we have a single node that's</span> <span data-start="823.999" data-end="825.919">spinning and on this thing is both WebGL</span> <span data-start="825.919" data-end="828.829">content and Dom content I'll get to more</span> <span data-start="828.829" data-end="830.36">about kind of the coordinate space and</span> <span data-start="830.36" data-end="831.619">while the layering is working later on</span> <span data-start="831.619" data-end="833.689">but you can see that like this API</span> <span data-start="833.689"

data-end="1149.779">Dom L or plane to the scene at the exact</span> <span data-start="1149.779" data-end="1152.09">same location as the Dom element so what</span> <span data-start="1152.09" data-end="1154.61">this does is this pretty much creates an</span> <span data-start="1154.61" data-end="1158.63">invisible plane that is referenced in</span> <span data-start="1158.63" data-end="1161.51">the WebGL render so that it can cut out</span> <span data-start="1161.51" data-end="1165.789">a little little spot for us and so</span> <span data-start="1165.789" data-end="1167.929">basically the thing is that you don't</span> <span data-start="1167.929" data-end="1170.72">ever have Dom in front of WebGL but what</span> <span data-start="1170.72" data-end="1172.13">happens is that we cut out a little</span> <span data-start="1172.13" data-end="1174.47">scene in our web Yale scene so that you</span> <span data-start="1174.47" data-end="1176.659">can look through see the Dom element</span> <span data-start="1176.659" data-end="1178.549">there and it lines up so perfectly that</span> <span data-start="1178.549"

data-end="1184.85">even tell that it's like actually</span> <span data-start="1184.85" data-end="1188.63">layered behind it in the Dom so here's</span> <span data-start="1188.63" data-end="1190.73">some of like the cut out stuff in action</span> <span data-start="1190.73" data-end="1193.73">so this is a scene where everything is</span> <span data-start="1193.73" data-end="1195.679">working just some context so we have a</span> <span data-start="1195.679" data-end="1197.659">little light here we have a GL plane and</span> <span data-start="1197.659" data-end="1199.19">we have a Dom element that's right here</span> <span data-start="1199.19" data-end="1202.039">so if we move this around from more on</span> <span data-start="1202.039" data-end="1204.47">perspective to like imagine you and your</span> <span data-start="1204.47" data-end="1206.779">the camera this looks correct like if I</span> <span data-start="1206.779" data-end="1210.169">turn this the angles are right and</span> <span data-start="1210.169" data-end="1211.549">everything is layered the way I would</span> <span data-start="1211.549" data-end="1216.47">imagine it to be so let's say we didn't</span> <span data-start="1216.47" data-end="1220.22">have let's say we didn't have cutouts on</span> <span data-start="1220.22" data-end="1222.679">so that there was no cutting out of that</span> <span data-start="1222.679" data-end="1225.679">invisible plane for for the WebGL scene</span> <span data-start="1225.679" data-end="1227.75">so you can see that like this looks</span> <span data-start="1227.75" data-end="1229.519">somewhere you know the light this was in</span> <span data-start="1229.519" data-end="1231.019">front rotating and you have your plane</span> <span data-start="1231.019" data-end="1233.899">and when I go behind it still looks</span> <span data-start="1233.899" data-end="1237.409">really really good but the issue is I'm</span> <span data-start="1237.409" data-end="1239.75">not cutting out from there so even</span> <span data-start="1239.75" data-end="1243.62">though the the pink div is technically</span> <span data-start="1243.62" data-end="1245">in front in world space we're not</span> <span data-start="1245" data-end="1246.47">cutting anything out of our plane to</span> <span data-start="1246.47" data-end="1248.419">account for this which is why it looks</span> <span data-start="1248.419" data-end="1249.95">like it's behind it looks like it gets</span> <span data-start="1249.95" data-end="1251.629">hidden behind but even though we know</span> <span data-start="1251.629" data-end="1252.98">that it's in front</span> <span data-start="1252.98" data-end="1256.13">in terms of world space another here's</span> <span data-start="1256.13" data-end="1257.66">one more example of kind of the exact</span> <span data-start="1257.66" data-end="1259.4">same demo but this shows it pretty well</span> <span data-start="1259.4" data-end="1262.07">so we have an invisible div right now</span> <span data-start="1262.07" data-end="1264.59">and we have the same thing so imagine</span> <span data-start="1264.59" data-end="1266.03">the invisible div is right right around</span> <span

data-start="1270.44" data-end="1273.83">we're just cutting out a plane inside of</span> <span data-start="1273.83" data-end="1276.77">our WebGL scene and now you get this</span> <span

data-start="1284.48" data-end="1287.32">way and we can abstract the like the</span> <span data-start="1287.32" data-end="1289.309">differences between the two rendering</span> <span
