and they work on their things</span> <span data-start="250.319" data-end="252.06">separately and then they come back</span> <span data-start="252.06" data-end="253.53">together and it's like I've got a gag</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.53" data-end="255.359">I've got a gag and they'd stitch them</span> <span data-start="255.359" data-end="257.82">together and then they play that before</span> <span data-start="257.82" data-end="259.169">a movie and that was all very well and</span> <span data-start="259.169" data-end="261.989">good until they cited to work on Snow</span> <span

that</span> <span data-start="273.94" data-end="276.21">dwarf sequence at all so they invented</span> <span data-start="276.21" data-end="278.73">storyboards which were just</span> <span

data-end="285.82">over to another studio plop down and let</span> <span data-start="285.82" data-end="288.73">new set of animators work on it so</span> <span data-start="288.73" data-end="291.43">anytime you needed to work with time and</span> <span data-start="291.43" data-end="294.67">talent it really helped I like to think</span> <span data-start="294.67"
