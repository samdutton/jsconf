<p><span data-start="496.08" data-end="501.959"><span class="speaker">Denis Radlin</span>: Thank you guys.</span> <span data-start="501.959" data-end="515.68">Yeah I suppose the difference is pretty big.</span> <span data-start="515.68" data-end="519.599">If you have seen before GPU is a hardworking kit which is put in every</span> <span data-start="519.599" data-end="525.88">line by a pencil, and CPU is another kind of kit using</span> <span data-start="525.88" data-end="527.08">stamps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.08" data-end="529.51">And if you use stamps you can get it more effective and</span> <span data-start="529.51" data-end="530.51">much faster.</span> <span data-start="530.51" data-end="544.74">So modern CPUs can possess millions and millions texture in surfaces in a second .. it</span> <span data-start="544.74" data-end="550.009">means millions of HTML elements like textured surfaces,</span> <span data-start="550.009" data-end="552">we can compare, yes?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="552" data-end="553">Cool.</span> <span data-start="553" data-end="555">Why so many?</span> <span data-start="555" data-end="558.981">Because for some things it is still not enough details, but</span> <span data-start="558.981" data-end="564.139">we can use this in 2D, and yeah, if you have a look at</span> <span data-start="564.139" data-end="568.569">the power we have in our PCs and Macs, it is pretty amazing,</span> <span data-start="568.569" data-end="575.79">so let's try to see what CPU do in modern games, because</span> <span data-start="575.79" data-end="579.579">WebGL and OpenGL is basically being used in modern</span> <span data-start="579.579" data-end="582.589">games and the same technology you can use to render</span> <span data-start="582.589" data-end="585.86">HTML and CSS.</span> <span data-start="585.86" data-end="595.94">The hand of this guy consist of about 50,000 textured</span> <span data-start="595.94" data-end="597.26">surfaces.</span> <span data-start="597.26" data-end="609.12">It means you can run 60,000 of HTML elements animated, with special effects, but the question,</span> <span data-start="609.12" data-end="618.8">the same stuff, they can do that, run all this</span> <span data-start="618.8" data-end="626.009">effects, bunch of surfaces, bunch of images at 60APS.</span> <span data-start="626.009" data-end="627.12">Why?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="627.12" data-end="635.92">Simple: slider janks.</span> <span data-start="635.92" data-end="647.19">Now, because CPU is not involved, sometimes and it</span> <span data-start="647.19" data-end="648.19">is quite complex.</span> <span data-start="648.19" data-end="654.37">So changing one thing, you're making a massive change.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="654.37" data-end="665.04">Chain effects, and still we can move away from DOM and use OpenGL by using a wrapper</span> <span data-start="665.04" data-end="666.04">on the OpenGL.</span> <span data-start="666.04" data-end="670.36">I don't know how many of you know about that.</span> <span data-start="670.36" data-end="674.579">And now we can check how performance that GL is compared</span> <span data-start="674.579" data-end="679.86">to OpenGL, so would we be impressed by the performance?</span> <span data-start="679.86" data-end="681.699">So let's release bunnies.</span> <span data-start="681.699" data-end="686.97">This one is a very simple benchmark, and now we have two bunnies, like</span> <span data-start="686.97" data-end="692.06">every bunny, to make it clear, could be compared</span> <span data-start="692.06" data-end="693.279">to HTML element.</span> <span data-start="693.279" data-end="695.939">So now we have two bunnies running at 60FPS.</span> <span data-start="695.939" data-end="696.939">It is cool.</span> <span data-start="696.939" data-end="704.97">Two HTML elements and we added them.</span> <span data-start="704.97" data-end="709.5">5,000 bunnies, 10,000 bunnies, 50,000 bunnies, 30,000</span> <span data-start="709.5" data-end="715.06">bunnies, still 60FPS, 50,000 bunnies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.06" data-end="716.389">Okay you guys.</span> <span data-start="716.389" data-end="717.92">FPS drop a bit.</span> <span data-start="717.92" data-end="718.92">Now still 60.</span> <span data-start="718.92" data-end="721.509">I mean already 80,000 bunnies.</span> <span data-start="721.509" data-end="729.31">So could you imagine, you can animated 80,000 of HTML</span> <span data-start="729.31" data-end="736.42">elements at the same time with WebGL, and I suppose</span> <span data-start="736.42" data-end="738.62">nobody even can imagine to do that with DOM.</span> <span data-start="738.62" data-end="741.079">But yeah, now it is possible.</span> <span data-start="741.079" data-end="746.769">A lot of bunnies.</span> <span data-start="746.769" data-end="756.899">Yes, so why don't we use WebGL for web content?</span> <span data-start="756.899" data-end="758.269">It is a bit tricky, basically.</span> <span data-start="758.269" data-end="765.25">So if you compare HTML, we are coming to this WebGL, we'll see that it is not that</span> <span data-start="765.25" data-end="768">easy so display, but any with WebGL, and basically</span> <span data-start="768" data-end="773.18">it is not even played by WebGL, it is 3js, it is an</span> <span data-start="773.18" data-end="777.61">engine which allows to make everything in easy simple way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="777.61" data-end="782.629">So yeah, it is plain WebGL, it will take five times</span> <span data-start="782.629" data-end="784.949">more.</span> <span data-start="784.949" data-end="790.81">And we are lazy, HTML developers, we can't do that.</span> <span data-start="790.81" data-end="794.1">Basically it is sad.</span> <span data-start="794.1" data-end="797.06">But here HTML GL changed the game.</span> <span data-start="797.06" data-end="801.54">It is pretty simple, you can just drop your content</span> <span data-start="801.54" data-end="805.14">with HTML GL pack and your contents are rendered in</span> <span data-start="805.14" data-end="806.29">WebGL.</span> <span data-start="806.29" data-end="809.339">It is easy to use.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="809.339" data-end="817.949">You can use it as JQuery, if you want to meet all the things WebGL and query, and yeah,</span> <span data-start="817.949" data-end="819.76">also you just animated.</span> <span data-start="819.76" data-end="822.749">It is as simple DOM element.</span> <span data-start="822.749" data-end="825.649">You can put some listeners, or etc.</span> <span data-start="825.649" data-end="829.529">So how it works?</span> <span data-start="829.529" data-end="834.24">When browser meets HTML GL element, it restores its texture, basically,</span> <span data-start="834.24" data-end="839.269">to element, and then can put it to a full screen WebGL</span> <span data-start="839.269" data-end="840.269">surface.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="840.269" data-end="843.85">So it's being displayed, and if something  —  do</span> <span data-start="843.85" data-end="845.55">I have a laser here?</span> <span data-start="845.55" data-end="848.059">Yes, green one.</span> <span data-start="848.059" data-end="852.089">So if something changes, there are two ways to go.</span> <span data-start="852.089" data-end="855.86">The first one is if content changed.</span> <span data-start="855.86" data-end="859.981">I mean, if you change the font or colour, so</span> <span data-start="859.981" data-end="863.529">you need to restore once more and display once more, but</span> <span data-start="863.529" data-end="872.449">if element was transformed, rotated, so it is very cheap</span> <span data-start="872.449" data-end="874.43">operations you can do on GPU.</span> <span data-start="874.43" data-end="879.779">So these transformations animations being made with GPU on this WebGL</span> <span data-start="879.779" data-end="882.959">or presentation of this WebGL slide, basically</span> <span data-start="882.959" data-end="886.86">it is extremely cheap and fast.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="886.86" data-end="890.251">So HTMLGL relies on DOM observers.</span> <span data-start="890.251" data-end="898.66">So it is to react on document change on element change.</span> <span data-start="898.66" data-end="901.759">It relies on HTML to canvas, and it relies on to render</span> <span data-start="901.759" data-end="909.589">the bit seen here is HTML, it is basically a bottleneck</span> <span data-start="909.589" data-end="914.699">because every restoration takes about 150 milliseconds,</span> <span data-start="914.699" data-end="920.399">so it is quite expensive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="920.399" data-end="929.949">And if you ever map the need to rasterise content, and you tried HTML to canvas</span> <span data-start="929.949" data-end="932.829">you found, guidance there should be a better way</span> <span data-start="932.829" data-end="934.689">to rasterise to canvas.</span> <span data-start="934.689" data-end="945.29">Please share the work, our trend to make rasterisation API, then get canvas,</span> <span data-start="945.29" data-end="950.009">we only have a polyfill as HTML to canvas, but in browser</span> <span data-start="950.009" data-end="953.089">it could be much more performance and less buggy, and</span> <span data-start="953.089" data-end="957.29">there is an article on my block and basically a draft</span> <span data-start="957.29" data-end="959.11">proposition and on spec.</span> <span data-start="959.11" data-end="966.97">So if you're interested in rasterisation API, please help you to spread the word.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="966.97" data-end="971.759">Let's go to some building.</span> <span data-start="971.759" data-end="987.649">You see simple HTML, you have.</span> <span data-start="987.649" data-end="990.8">So we have HTML GL element.</span> <span data-start="990.8" data-end="991.86">Nice.</span> <span data-start="991.86" data-end="996.249">But the issue is that this one, this page, it doesn't include</span> <span data-start="996.249" data-end="999.05">HTML GL library, but it is still valid HTML.</span> <span data-start="999.05" data-end="1003.85">It is basically a custom, it could mean nothing or it could</span> <span data-start="1003.85" data-end="1008.189">mean least render to WebGL, so in this case it means</span> <span data-start="1008.189" data-end="1009.689">nothing.</span> <span data-start="1009.689" data-end="1015.61">And pushing the animated button, we see that at</span> <span data-start="1015.61" data-end="1019.629">the H point browser make a decision to rasterise text</span> <span data-start="1019.629" data-end="1020.839">once more.</span> <span data-start="1020.839" data-end="1022.829">So let's repeat.</span> <span data-start="1022.829" data-end="1028">Look at the edge point, we see the image is a bit blurry, and then browser seems okay,</span> <span data-start="1028" data-end="1029">let's rasterise.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1029" data-end="1031.579">That's basically what I said: the browser is</span> <span data-start="1031.579" data-end="1037.309">predictable.</span> <span data-start="1037.309" data-end="1045.699">WebGL allows to avoid it.</span> <span data-start="1045.699" data-end="1049.559">Let's move to the same demo but basically it is absolutely the same</span> <span data-start="1049.559" data-end="1054.75">HTML, but HTML GL library is included.</span> <span data-start="1054.75" data-end="1060.44">So yeah, if you press the button, the same happens, absolutely the same</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1060.44" data-end="1064.299">JavaScript code animates, but basically we control the</span> <span data-start="1064.299" data-end="1069.669">authorisation, we can rasterise manually, but we may</span> <span data-start="1069.669" data-end="1075.12">respond to it later, but yeah, we control rasterisation</span> <span data-start="1075.12" data-end="1081.33">and we useWebGL to animate that.</span> <span data-start="1081.33" data-end="1090.09">Let's try to change content and layout, so sends to the observer</span> <span data-start="1090.09" data-end="1093.44">all changes you are making a note, so you are changing</span> <span data-start="1093.44" data-end="1099.82">in HTML or whatever, they are being cached by HTML GL,</span> <span data-start="1099.82" data-end="1102.62">and not has been rendered, so we don't care about that.</span> <span data-start="1102.62" data-end="1104.29">So let's proceed to the next example.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1104.29" data-end="1108.6">Small, more complex, and basically this is one of prototypes</span> <span data-start="1108.6" data-end="1114.279">we did in liberty level, some list of movies.</span> <span data-start="1114.279" data-end="1118.21">And it is slides, basically.</span> <span data-start="1118.21" data-end="1122.539">What we see here, that nodes are still on the same place, so when we animate</span> <span data-start="1122.539" data-end="1127.35">we only do it on WebGL or presentation.</span> <span data-start="1127.35" data-end="1134.399">But actual nodes take place, and still everything is expectable</span> <span data-start="1134.399" data-end="1139.69">and we can change the content.</span> <span data-start="1139.69" data-end="1143.3">So WebGL, but it renders.</span> <span data-start="1143.3" data-end="1151.07">Also, it's nice to mention this demo, even we click</span> <span data-start="1151.07" data-end="1153.82">on the WebGL presentation, not on the node, you can</span> <span data-start="1153.82" data-end="1156.36">still use the events in the same way you use them in</span> <span data-start="1156.36" data-end="1157.43">the HTML.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1157.43" data-end="1160.44">You basically click on it in listener, everything is the</span> <span data-start="1160.44" data-end="1168.78">same, you still use your DOM amount as HTML presentations.</span> <span data-start="1168.78" data-end="1176.44">And this one, in previous, was possible to implement in DOM or HTML GL.</span> <span data-start="1176.44" data-end="1180.47">The next one is HTML GL scene.</span> <span data-start="1180.47" data-end="1182.669">You can't do this with DOM.</span> <span data-start="1182.669" data-end="1185.54">So we have some filters on that.</span> <span data-start="1185.54" data-end="1188.4">Yes, it is kind of displacement.</span> <span data-start="1188.4" data-end="1194.36">We can add more, but still what is nice, it is</span> <span data-start="1194.36" data-end="1199.11">still HTML content.</span> <span data-start="1199.11" data-end="1209.27">You still can inspect that, it's too much.</span> <span data-start="1209.27" data-end="1213.38">But you can apply all kind of shaders you can expect</span> <span data-start="1213.38" data-end="1223.91">from OpenGL, just a bit more.</span> <span data-start="1223.91" data-end="1229.519">Just nobody will be impressed by blue nowadays, but okay, we have</span> <span data-start="1229.519" data-end="1232.39">blue, we have any kind of modifications.</span> <span data-start="1232.39" data-end="1234.35">Okay twist.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1234.35" data-end="1240.23">Still HTML content.</span> <span data-start="1240.23" data-end="1243.64">We still can inspect that.</span> <span data-start="1243.64" data-end="1249.47">And basically, yes, we still can change a content and talk</span> <span data-start="1249.47" data-end="1254.789">to our content as come to it.</span> <span data-start="1254.789" data-end="1261.34">The next demo is quite  —  could be useful for phone</span> <span data-start="1261.34" data-end="1265.68">cap users, and it basically shows how you can work with</span> <span data-start="1265.68" data-end="1268">effects, how API is built.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1268" data-end="1270.35">Yes, it is nice effect.</span> <span data-start="1270.35" data-end="1272.419">It wriggles.</span> <span data-start="1272.419" data-end="1279.95">So it is simple page you can build with display line or whatever, just some ideas,</span> <span data-start="1279.95" data-end="1282.72">you have a regular effect on that, but the effect has</span> <span data-start="1282.72" data-end="1285.85">been applied, effects attribute.</span> <span data-start="1285.85" data-end="1288.44">Let's add some more, let's add some noise.</span> <span data-start="1288.44" data-end="1291.56">Pouffe, we have some noise.</span> <span data-start="1291.56" data-end="1297.03">Let's move it to mobile, I suppose it is going to be</span> <span data-start="1297.03" data-end="1304.059">a mobile, let's add there.</span> <span data-start="1304.059" data-end="1309.76">Pouffe, we inverted the colours.</span> <span data-start="1309.76" data-end="1313.51">Let's add some contrast.</span> <span data-start="1313.51" data-end="1319.409">I mean it doesn't look like our initial HTML, it is basically was modified</span> <span data-start="1319.409" data-end="1326.169">by using a shaders, yeah, my favourite one, twist.</span> <span data-start="1326.169" data-end="1348.91">So it's still HTML guys, it is still .. yes.</span> <span data-start="1348.91" data-end="1355.47">You don't need to study reconceptions, everything is you are coming</span> <span data-start="1355.47" data-end="1356.47">to.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1381.23" data-end="1384.11">I mean just any kinds of effects you can imagine.</span> <span data-start="1384.11" data-end="1389.07">You can modify your content absolutely in any way you can imagine to.</span> <span data-start="1389.07" data-end="1391.92">Basically, all power of CPU which is being used in modern</span> <span data-start="1391.92" data-end="1397.4">games to service to modify your web content.</span> <span data-start="1397.4" data-end="1402.799">Yeah, of course it is open source.</span> <span data-start="1402.799" data-end="1406.309">And the nice thing it is really agnostic, so you put your</span> <span data-start="1406.309" data-end="1409.159">HTML GL tech any way you want.</span> <span data-start="1409.159" data-end="1411.44">So any in framework.</span> <span data-start="1411.44" data-end="1416.21">But there are some bindings for ember and there is a</span> <span data-start="1416.21" data-end="1419.85">link, and there is a binding for WebGL.</span> <span data-start="1419.85" data-end="1426.5">So yeah, we use it together with react as HTML GL tech or use</span> <span data-start="1426.5" data-end="1429.39">react GL bindings like a component.</span> </p>
