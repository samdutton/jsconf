data-start="16.099" data-end="18.47">talking about component libraries and</span> <span data-start="18.47" data-end="20.3">you might say what's the component</span> <span data-start="20.3" data-end="22.849">library which is what everyone at my</span> <span data-start="22.849" data-end="25.25">company said when I said hey let's build</span> <span data-start="25.25" data-end="28.88">a component library so I try to make it</span> <span data-start="28.88" data-end="31.509">easier for them everyone had heard of</span> <span data-start="31.509" data-end="35.78">bootstrap and so at work I started</span> <span data-start="35.78" data-end="39.04">working on something called boot stripe</span> <span data-start="39.04" data-end="43.16">it's pretty good you'll get it it'll</span> <span data-start="43.16" data-end="48.38">come to you uh so i encourage you to</span> <span data-start="48.38" data-end="51.68">build your own component library mainly</span> <span data-start="51.68" data-end="53.48">so you get to make your own something</span> <span data-start="53.48" data-end="57.41">strap j/s comp strap whatever you want</span> <span data-start="57.41" data-end="59.329">to do stripes trap didn't work quite as</span> <span data-start="59.329" data-end="61.7">well as boot stripe so that's what we</span> <span data-start="61.7" data-end="64.54">want with but oh why right one at all</span> <span data-start="64.54" data-end="67.25">you could just build your application</span> <span data-start="67.25" data-end="68.689">and then when you get to a button you</span> <span data-start="68.689" data-end="70.64">style the button and then when you get</span> <span data-start="70.64" data-end="73.63">to a drop-down you style the drop-down</span> <span data-start="73.63" data-end="76.19">just like we've made web applications</span> <span data-start="76.19" data-end="79.549">for a really long time so I've prepared</span> <span data-start="79.549" data-end="82.82">a list of facts that are definitely true</span> <span data-start="82.82" data-end="87.14">about CSS the first CSS fact is that</span> <span data-start="87.14" data-end="89.78">once you write a line of CSS it can</span> <span data-start="89.78" data-end="94.58">never be deleted it sounds like a myth</span> <span data-start="94.58" data-end="96.409">what if you think about your app you're</span> <span data-start="96.409" data-end="98.09">always just a little too scared to</span> <span data-start="98.09" data-end="101.36">remove code and so you just add new</span> <span data-start="101.36" data-end="105.74">classes to go over those ones so i like</span> <span data-start="105.74" data-end="108.76">to call CSS an append only language</span> <span data-start="108.76" data-end="114.83">that's good you get code like this this</span> <span data-start="114.83" data-end="116.45">is my favorite I always see blocks like</span> <span data-start="116.45" data-end="117.71">this that you put this on a div it</span> <span data-start="117.71" data-end="121.159">literally does nothing but you're like</span> <span data-start="121.159" data-end="123.77">well is it overriding the padding is</span> <span data-start="123.77" data-end="126.47">that I'm just gonna leave this here this</span> <span data-start="126.47" data-end="129.2">is fine I think it's not hurting anyone</span> <span data-start="129.2" data-end="134.379">so never remove it yeah so the fact 2is</span> <span data-start="134.379" data-end="137.39">preprocessors are great as long as you</span> <span data-start="137.39" data-end="140.06">know exactly what the output this is my</span> <span data-start="140.06" data-end="144.709">favorite way of looking at nesting very</span> <span data-start="144.709" data-end="148.13">common output for you gzip lovers this</span> <span data-start="148.13" data-end="151.34">is like a your best-case scenario though</span> <span data-start="151.34" data-end="154.4">so that's pretty great CSS fact three is</span> <span data-start="154.4" data-end="157.16">that no two people write CSS in a</span> <span data-start="157.16" data-end="161.39">similar way I feel like I work with some</span> <span data-start="161.39" data-end="163.04">of the smartest people in the universe</span> <span data-start="163.04" data-end="165.65">and this is probably about as best as I</span> <span data-start="165.65" data-end="169.31">could ask for literally every type of</span> <span data-start="169.31" data-end="171.41">casing and then some casings that don't</span> <span data-start="171.41" data-end="176.54">actually exist so yeah I'm sure you</span> <span data-start="176.54" data-end="179.09">recognize the naming schemes from your</span> <span data-start="179.09" data-end="181.78">own code and that's why you're laughing</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="185.51">so CSS fact for is you cannot test to</span> </p>
