stuff so the basics number one</span> <span data-start="382.68" data-end="385.409">hierarchy this is a really important</span> <span data-start="385.409" data-end="388.32">thing when a user comes to your page and</span> <span data-start="388.32" data-end="390.27">they don't know what to click what are</span> <span data-start="390.27" data-end="393.27">you supposed to do so the thing I tell</span> <span data-start="393.27" data-end="394.8">people is you want to pick out out</span> <span data-start="394.8" data-end="396.75">number one on number two and a number</span> <span data-start="396.75" data-end="398.88">three so what's the most important thing</span> <span data-start="398.88" data-end="401.009">on the page it should be the most</span> <span data-start="401.009" data-end="402.3">obvious thing that's your number one</span> <span data-start="402.3" data-end="405.36">number two it should be obvious that</span> <span data-start="405.36" data-end="407.219">it's a number two so we'll go through an</span> <span data-start="407.219" data-end="409.289">example a good way to tell this is a</span> <span data-start="409.289" data-end="411.36">squint test I'm kind of doing it for you</span> <span data-start="411.36" data-end="413.52">blurring it so you can see the top</span> <span data-start="413.52" data-end="416.46">example it has just this basic block of</span> <span data-start="416.46" data-end="419.759">text when you squint your eyes and you</span> <span data-start="419.759" data-end="421.229">look over at the right it's kind of just</span> <span

data-end="432.389">to the bottom we've bolded the text for</span> <span data-start="432.389" data-end="434.309">the headline eat more vegetables and</span> <span data-start="434.309" data-end="436.529">we've put a button we've made the call</span> <span data-start="436.529" data-end="438.33">to action sign up button a bit more</span> <span data-start="438.33" data-end="439.86">important so that's the second most</span> <span data-start="439.86" data-end="441.479">important thing on the element and then</span> <span data-start="441.479" data-end="444.479">there's display text to help reinforce</span> <span data-start="444.479" data-end="446.279">that but that's a good thing to keep in</span> <span data-start="446.279" data-end="448.02">mind when you're doing things just make</span> <span data-start="448.02" data-end="451.169">things hierarchy make the most important</span> <span data-start="451.169" data-end="453.99">things obvious and then go from there um</span> <span data-start="453.99" data-end="457.499">balance is another thing sometimes you</span> <span data-start="457.499" data-end="459.089">go to a web page and it can be all</span> <span data-start="459.089" data-end="460.77">everything's on the left-hand side and</span> <span data-start="460.77" data-end="463.139">there's some input like important</span> <span data-start="463.139" data-end="466.62">information out hanging out but it looks</span> <span data-start="466.62" data-end="468.089">like it's going to fall over so this</span> <span data-start="468.089" data-end="470.43">example is we have a line straight down</span> <span data-start="470.43" data-end="472.74">the middle of this page this line is</span> <span data-start="472.74" data-end="476.43">dividing the white block in half but on</span> <span data-start="476.43" data-end="478.979">the the left-hand example the big blue</span> <span data-start="478.979" data-end="480.93">block is like taking up so much space</span> <span data-start="480.93" data-end="483.24">and it's dominating it so it's making</span> <span data-start="483.24" data-end="484.439">everything feel like it's going to shift</span> <span data-start="484.439" data-end="487.86">over to the left now to offset that on</span> <span data-start="487.86" data-end="490.949">the right hand example um a trick you</span> <span data-start="490.949" data-end="493.529">can do is kind of move the little guys</span> <span data-start="493.529" data-end="496.649">away so it's creating the illusion of</span> <span data-start="496.649"

data-end="716.31">confused they might not trust your app</span> <span data-start="716.31" data-end="718.8">quite as much so just being intentional</span> <span data-start="718.8" data-end="720.9">about the little things is going to</span> <span data-start="720.9" data-end="722.54">really set you apart and bring some</span> <span data-start="722.54" data-end="725.4">clarity and

and</span> <span data-start="729.99" data-end="732.33">stuff that you can pull apart you know</span> <span data-start="732.33" data-end="733.95">you all know bootstrap and stuff</span> <span data-start="733.95" data-end="737.82">bootstraps great um but I want to help</span> <span data-start="737.82" data-end="740.13">you guys understand bootstrap a little</span> <span data-start="740.13" data-end="741.57">bit more so you can make bootstrap a</span> <span data-start="741.57" data-end="743.64">little boot less bootstrap II and more</span> <span data-start="743.64" data-end="747.45">custom to what you want so let's go</span> <span data-start="747.45" data-end="749.55">through some of these points and let's</span> <span data-start="749.55" data-end="752.61">go through and make a little widget okay</span> <span data-start="752.61" data-end="754.02">so we're going to go through everything</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="754.02" data-end="757.71">I've talked about so far and we're going</span> <span data-start="757.71" data-end="759.96">to talk about it so number one here's</span> <span data-start="759.96" data-end="762.81">our little silly little widget where are</span> <span data-start="762.81" data-end="764.4">you from help us customize your</span> <span data-start="764.4" data-end="765.93">experience and then a little drop-down</span> <span data-start="765.93" data-end="768.15">menu with a submit button so we're just</span> <span data-start="768.15" data-end="771.54">going to start off bit by bit point by</span> <span data-start="771.54" data-end="773.49">point and let's go through and tighten</span> <span data-start="773.49" data-end="776.4">this up a little bit more visually so</span> <span data-start="776.4" data-end="777.9">hierarchy we talked about hierarchy</span> <span data-start="777.9" data-end="779.61">first the first thing we're going to do</span> <span data-start="779.61" data-end="783.21">is okay let's increase the size of the</span> <span data-start="783.21" data-end="785.25">question the main question we're asking</span> <span data-start="785.25" data-end="786.78">the user that should be the first thing</span> <span data-start="786.78" data-end="787.95">like they need to know what they're</span> <span data-start="787.95" data-end="791.55">getting into that helper tests isn't the</span> <span data-start="791.55" data-end="793.5">help us customize your experience isn't</span> <span data-start="793.5" data-end="796.68">super important um it could be but we're</span> <span data-start="796.68" data-end="799.67">going to bring down the point size so</span> <span data-start="799.67" data-end="801.36">separating the</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="804.089">headline and the helper text is going to</span> <span data-start="804.089" data-end="808.26">help us create hierarchy number two is</span> <span data-start="808.26" data-end="811.62">balance okay so you can see and I'm</span> <span data-start="811.62" data-end="814.5">going left is the previous widget and</span> <span data-start="814.5" data-end="817.14">right is what we're updating so it's a</span> <span data-start="817.14" data-end="818.85">little unbalanced everything shifted</span> <span data-start="818.85" data-end="821.1">over to the right or to the left hand</span> <span data-start="821.1" data-end="823.29">side on the left hand widget and it's it</span> <span data-start="823.29" data-end="825.5">just seems a little sloppy unintentional</span> <span data-start="825.5" data-end="827.79">so this will bring in tension year</span> <span data-start="827.79" data-end="829.23">design so you want everything to feel</span> <span data-start="829.23" data-end="831.12">balanced let's Center everything put it</span> <span data-start="831.12" data-end="834.329">in the middle and make sense contrast</span> <span data-start="834.329" data-end="836.69">okay well let's make it a little bit</span> <span data-start="836.69" data-end="839.55">let's increase the hierarchy let's make</span> <span data-start="839.55" data-end="841.079">things a little bit more apparent what</span> <span data-start="841.079" data-end="843.87">we want the user to do so we we made the</span> <span data-start="843.87" data-end="846.089">submit button green added more contrast</span> <span data-start="846.089" data-end="848.76">to it obvious that we want them to click</span> <span data-start="848.76" data-end="851.01">and we took down the contrast of the</span> <span data-start="851.01" data-end="852.839">help us customize this experience</span> <span data-start="852.839" data-end="854.85">because it's still not that important so</span> <span data-start="854.85" data-end="856.56">we're we're going to tone it back even</span> <span data-start="856.56" data-end="860.16">more so contrast will help us build even</span> <span data-start="860.16" data-end="863.85">more hierarchy white space okay so this</span> <span data-start="863.85" data-end="865.86">text is feeling a little this widgets</span> <span data-start="865.86" data-end="867.149">feeling a little crammed and we have</span> <span data-start="867.149" data-end="869.61">plenty room of room on this page to add</span> <span data-start="869.61" data-end="871.89">some white space so we opened up the</span> <span data-start="871.89" data-end="875.25">padding on the sides we gave the submit</span> <span data-start="875.25" data-end="877.32">button a little bit more padding so it's</span> <span data-start="877.32" data-end="880.05">even more of a call to action and it</span> <span data-start="880.05" data-end="882.69">makes sense but when we did that we are</span> <span data-start="882.69" data-end="886.35">we did we forgot to align our the</span> <span data-start="886.35" data-end="888.66">drop-down menu with the submit button so</span> <span data-start="888.66" data-end="890.43">that's something that on the left hand</span> <span data-start="890.43" data-end="893.13">side it looks kind of like a mistake but</span> <span data-start="893.13" data-end="894.48">if you put it in a little bit more</span> <span data-start="894.48" data-end="896.37">effort you have those things align</span> <span data-start="896.37" data-end="898.29">that's the polish that it's going to</span> <span data-start="898.29" data-end="900.57">make your users just appreciate little</span> <span data-start="900.57" data-end="902.519">things and add a little bit of trust to</span> <span data-start="902.519" data-end="906.089">what you're doing um consistency now</span> <span data-start="906.089" data-end="907.829">this would be this one might be a little</span> <span data-start="907.829" data-end="910.38">bit hard for for some people to pick up</span> <span data-start="910.38" data-end="911.94">but it's just something to train your</span> <span data-start="911.94" data-end="913.86">eye to look for the inconsistent thing</span> <span data-start="913.86" data-end="917.07">here is the fonts and this is where I</span> <span data-start="917.07" data-end="918.779">might lose you a little bit but I hope I</span> <span data-start="918.779" data-end="920.399">keep you is it the fonts in the</span> <span data-start="920.399" data-end="922.019">drop-down menu and the fonts and the</span> <span data-start="922.019" data-end="925.17">submit button are different than the</span> <span data-start="925.17"
