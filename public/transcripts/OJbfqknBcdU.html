<p><span data-start="5.55" data-end="9.63">welcome to OMG streams I am Pam you can</span> <span data-start="9.63" data-end="11.76">find me on the internet at pama sore and</span> <span data-start="11.76" data-end="14.16">my also somewhat dinosaur-themed website</span> <span data-start="14.16" data-end="17.49">the web before com and so the thesis</span> <span data-start="17.49" data-end="18.72">today they're going to talk about is</span> <span data-start="18.72" data-end="21.119">that streams are the most awesome data</span> <span data-start="21.119" data-end="22.619">structure that you don't know enough</span> <span data-start="22.619" data-end="25.169">about so the goal today is that you are</span> <span data-start="25.169" data-end="26.79">going to leave here as excited about</span> <span data-start="26.79" data-end="30.66">streams data structure as I am so step</span> <span data-start="30.66" data-end="37.17">one streams streams streams so I'm going</span> <span data-start="37.17" data-end="39.93">to start with some history so I wanted</span> <span data-start="39.93" data-end="41.699">to find out when I became interested in</span> <span data-start="41.699" data-end="43.019">the streams data structure where the</span> <span data-start="43.019" data-end="46.019">first instance of what the stream data</span> <span data-start="46.019" data-end="47.879">structure looks like was and as far as I</span> <span data-start="47.879" data-end="52.519">could tell it seems to be unix and so ah</span> <span data-start="52.519" data-end="60.629">ah wrong window hold please excellent so</span> <span data-start="60.629" data-end="63.03">all glory to the pipe operator so if you</span> <span data-start="63.03" data-end="66.48">do something like this in UNIX so if</span> <span data-start="66.48" data-end="68.97">you've opened your terminal then cat</span> <span data-start="68.97" data-end="74.1">lets you send that the value from best</span> <span data-start="74.1" data-end="78.36">animals text into the grep I command so</span> <span data-start="78.36" data-end="80.85">the output from the first man is piped</span> <span data-start="80.85" data-end="82.08">to the second command is how you would</span> <span data-start="82.08" data-end="84.66">say that and so that looks like just you</span> <span data-start="84.66" data-end="88.07">know because we can soak at best animals</span> <span data-start="88.07" data-end="90.51">so that's that come in by itself and</span> <span data-start="90.51" data-end="92.43">then if we had the pipe operator called</span> <span data-start="92.43" data-end="94.35">a pipe because it looks like a stick but</span> <span data-start="94.35" data-end="95.7">also you can think of it because data is</span> <span data-start="95.7" data-end="98.85">flowing through it and so we grew up so</span> <span data-start="98.85" data-end="101.25">globally search case-insensitive for</span> <span data-start="101.25" data-end="103.44">cats because cats around the internet</span> <span data-start="103.44" data-end="107.16">and so we can you know so if you've</span> <span data-start="107.16" data-end="108.21">opened the terminal you've been using</span> <span data-start="108.21" data-end="110.49">streams and that's actually where the</span> <span data-start="110.49" data-end="112.05">first instance that I can find started</span> <span data-start="112.05" data-end="114.18">without even probably knowing that</span> <span data-start="114.18" data-end="117.36">that's a stream stash structure what are</span> <span data-start="117.36" data-end="120.15">streams so streams are an abstract data</span> <span data-start="120.15" data-end="122.25">structure that means that when you see a</span> <span data-start="122.25" data-end="124.56">stream like in UNIX it won't necessarily</span> <span data-start="124.56" data-end="127.65">be called a stream so as abstract so you</span> <span data-start="127.65" data-end="129.569">can have multiple flavors of them you</span> <span data-start="129.569" data-end="130.86">might see them come in different forms</span> <span data-start="130.86" data-end="134.52">but ultimately they're still streams so</span> <span data-start="134.52" data-end="136.65">a real world demo I'm going to have my</span> <span data-start="136.65" data-end="138.84">buddy Joe come up here</span> <span data-start="138.84" data-end="142.26">we have a real-life experiment to</span> <span data-start="142.26" data-end="144.84">demonstrate how streams work but we're</span> <span data-start="144.84" data-end="147.39">going to take water and it needs to go</span> <span data-start="147.39" data-end="152.489">from this first cup through the through</span> <span data-start="152.489" data-end="154.73">the second cup and into the third cup</span> <span data-start="154.73" data-end="157.95">because reasons so this is the task that</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="160.739">we on you know on the assembly line have</span> <span data-start="160.739" data-end="170.16">to do here's one way to do it all right</span> <span data-start="170.16" data-end="172.709">now with some highly specialized</span> <span data-start="172.709" data-end="178.95">modifications to the second cup we can</span> <span data-start="178.95" data-end="180.209">make it more like a stream data</span> <span data-start="180.209" data-end="181.769">structure so let's pretend let's swap</span> <span data-start="181.769" data-end="184.379">these so this is now cup one cool all</span> <span data-start="184.379" data-end="186.12">right so now we're going to do this</span> <span data-start="186.12" data-end="189.45">operation with streams are you ready all</span> <span data-start="189.45" data-end="197.73">right all right thank you Joe that you</span> <span data-start="197.73" data-end="203.19">can keep that you're welcome so the</span> <span data-start="203.19" data-end="205.5">streams data structure is basically it</span> <span data-start="205.5" data-end="209.25">lets us flow through rather than having</span> <span data-start="209.25" data-end="211.139">to make you know stops at every stage</span> <span data-start="211.139" data-end="214.01">and that ends up being really powerful</span> <span data-start="214.01" data-end="216.66">so I'm going to bring up sicp because</span> <span data-start="216.66" data-end="218.76">this is kind of a canonical texts ossep</span> <span data-start="218.76" data-end="220.26">is structure interpretation computer</span> <span data-start="220.26" data-end="222.12">programs if you have a computer science</span> <span data-start="222.12" data-end="223.29">degree you might have read it if you</span> <span data-start="223.29" data-end="224.489">have a computer science degree and you</span> <span data-start="224.489" data-end="225.599">have not read it you probably feel</span> <span data-start="225.599" data-end="227.94">guilty about it so it's the canonical</span> <span data-start="227.94" data-end="229.799">texting computer science and it what it</span> <span data-start="229.799" data-end="232.26">defines as streams are their delay list</span> <span data-start="232.26" data-end="234.45">well what does that exactly mean so a</span> <span data-start="234.45" data-end="237.87">delay list means that you can treat them</span> <span data-start="237.87" data-end="240.69">like a list structure but you don't have</span> <span data-start="240.69" data-end="242.94">to have all the values at once that's</span> <span data-start="242.94" data-end="246.09">really tricky and really really cool so</span> <span data-start="246.09" data-end="247.859">why would we want streams why we want</span> <span data-start="247.859" data-end="250.53">these this delayed list structure well</span> <span data-start="250.53" data-end="252.359">you can't or don't want to hold</span> <span data-start="252.359" data-end="254.819">everything in memory and you bandwidth</span> <span data-start="254.819" data-end="257.789">is expensive so as we progress in</span> <span data-start="257.789" data-end="259.65">computing you know the facts change</span> <span data-start="259.65" data-end="261.72">constantly some facts that are still</span> <span data-start="261.72" data-end="263.52">true is we don't want to waste memory</span> <span data-start="263.52" data-end="265.95">and we also bandwidth continues to be</span> <span data-start="265.95" data-end="267.99">expensive it's not you know it's not</span> <span data-start="267.99" data-end="271.59">free so we want to use streams to limit</span> <span data-start="271.59" data-end="272.87">the use of those resources</span> <span data-start="272.87" data-end="275.82">so streams and why you should be extra</span> <span data-start="275.82" data-end="278.76">excited about them so streams being a</span> <span data-start="278.76" data-end="280.86">delayed list structure let you represent</span> <span data-start="280.86" data-end="287.09">possibly infinite data infinite data</span> <span data-start="287.09" data-end="291">making you a wizard because you can</span> <span data-start="291" data-end="293.61">represent infinity in data which is</span> <span data-start="293.61" data-end="295.65">really really fascinating really really</span> <span data-start="295.65" data-end="297.87">cool so what are some things that don't</span> <span data-start="297.87" data-end="299.7">even you said infinity that doesn't</span> <span data-start="299.7" data-end="302.4">actually exist wrong some things that</span> <span data-start="302.4" data-end="303.6">don't have an end just a few examples</span> <span data-start="303.6" data-end="306.27">and natural numbers you can always get a</span> <span data-start="306.27" data-end="308.01">new natural number by adding one to any</span> <span data-start="308.01" data-end="309.93">natural number that you have whether</span> <span data-start="309.93" data-end="312.93">natural phenomena for a lot of you I</span> <span data-start="312.93" data-end="315.98">people keystrokes events in the browser</span> <span data-start="315.98" data-end="318.66">you don't know when the end large data</span> <span data-start="318.66" data-end="319.95">sets your heartbeat these have stars</span> <span data-start="319.95" data-end="321.12">because I definitely have an end you</span> <span data-start="321.12" data-end="324.54">just don't know what it is so you</span> <span data-start="324.54" data-end="326.49">operate under the assumption that you</span> <span data-start="326.49" data-end="328.35">don't have you don't have to care when</span> <span data-start="328.35" data-end="329.7">the end is and that's what streams let</span> <span data-start="329.7" data-end="331.65">you do they let you not have to care</span> <span data-start="331.65" data-end="335.25">about when it ends so why I brought as I</span> <span data-start="335.25" data-end="337.5">cp's partially so I could bring this up</span> <span data-start="337.5" data-end="339.69">is that stream processing lets us model</span> <span data-start="339.69" data-end="341.22">systems that have state without ever</span> <span data-start="341.22" data-end="343.65">using assignment or mutable data that is</span> <span data-start="343.65" data-end="345.65">really awesome so let's look at it again</span> <span data-start="345.65" data-end="350.22">so awesome so stream processing let you</span> <span data-start="350.22" data-end="352.62">model systems with state but you don't</span> <span data-start="352.62" data-end="354.51">have to incur the cost of assignment or</span> <span data-start="354.51" data-end="357.17">mutable data so you can move faster</span> <span data-start="357.17" data-end="359.31">because you aren't storing things in</span> <span data-start="359.31" data-end="360.54">memory and you aren't mutating data</span> <span data-start="360.54" data-end="361.71">which is something that we're talking</span> <span data-start="361.71" data-end="365.25">about a lot today these days so really</span> <span data-start="365.25" data-end="366.51">really cool and you should be really</span> <span data-start="366.51" data-end="368.25">excited by streams especially how</span> <span data-start="368.25" data-end="370.59">they're able to represent how we move</span> <span data-start="370.59" data-end="372">through the world that is we move</span> <span data-start="372" data-end="373.74">through large data sets we move through</span> <span data-start="373.74" data-end="375.42">real-time data we move through things</span> <span data-start="375.42" data-end="377.04">where we don't know when they end and</span> <span data-start="377.04" data-end="378.93">streams are the data structure that let</span> <span data-start="378.93" data-end="381.93">us do that so streams abstract a</span> <span data-start="381.93" data-end="383.31">structure that means it can come in</span> <span data-start="383.31" data-end="384.99">multiple flavors in general actually</span> <span data-start="384.99" data-end="387.12">kind of splits into two standard flavors</span> <span data-start="387.12" data-end="389.31">so there's push streams and pull streams</span> <span data-start="389.31" data-end="393.57">so Bush dreams are like the fire hose so</span> <span data-start="393.57" data-end="396.93">a push stream is it you can think of it</span> <span data-start="396.93" data-end="399.54">like the fire hose like if you have your</span> <span data-start="399.54" data-end="400.74">at the end of the fire hose and you just</span> <span data-start="400.74" data-end="402.84">open it up and then it's just pushing</span> <span data-start="402.84" data-end="406.04">water out and so</span> <span data-start="406.04" data-end="408.08">you can deal with that in computing</span> <span data-start="408.08" data-end="410.51">there will you know has as positives and</span> <span data-start="410.51" data-end="413.03">has this negative so you think you're</span> <span data-start="413.03" data-end="414.65">using a push stream when you see things</span> <span data-start="414.65" data-end="417.05">like callbacks so there's someone</span> <span data-start="417.05" data-end="418.01">standing at the end of the hallway</span> <span data-start="418.01" data-end="419.45">getting the firehose sermon at them</span> <span data-start="419.45" data-end="421.07">they're doing something about it when</span> <span data-start="421.07" data-end="423.14">they get the water third of them I don't</span> <span data-start="423.14" data-end="426.38">know non-blocking so once the stream is</span> <span data-start="426.38" data-end="428.54">open it doesn't stop flowing it just</span> <span data-start="428.54" data-end="430.42">goes so that's the push stream and the</span> <span data-start="430.42" data-end="433.07">downside because there's cost any any</span> <span data-start="433.07" data-end="435.98">structure is that possible overload so</span> <span data-start="435.98" data-end="438.14">if you stood you know 10 feet in front</span> <span data-start="438.14" data-end="440.54">of a fire hose that probably wouldn't go</span> <span data-start="440.54" data-end="443.72">so well in the same way if you are a</span> <span data-start="443.72" data-end="446.75">consumer so in stream processing we</span> <span data-start="446.75" data-end="448.43">talked about producers and consumers or</span> <span data-start="448.43" data-end="451.19">sources and subscribers but they all</span> <span data-start="451.19" data-end="452.57">kind of mean similar things so if you</span> <span data-start="452.57" data-end="455.12">have a producer and a consumer and the</span> <span data-start="455.12" data-end="458.6">consumer can be overloaded by a push</span> <span data-start="458.6" data-end="461.18">stream from the producer then that's a</span> <span data-start="461.18" data-end="464.93">problem so you have to use push streams</span> <span data-start="464.93" data-end="466.13">in an environment where you're</span> <span data-start="466.13" data-end="469.1">protecting against that so the other</span> <span data-start="469.1" data-end="472.1">flavor is pull streams so pull strings</span> <span data-start="472.1" data-end="474.95">rather than having the data thrown at</span> <span data-start="474.95" data-end="477.23">you just you know I can handle whatever</span> <span data-start="477.23" data-end="479.3">data you throw at me pull streams are</span> <span data-start="479.3" data-end="481.94">more like a leak like a data leak lake</span> <span data-start="481.94" data-end="485.3">of calm data and when you want data you</span> <span data-start="485.3" data-end="487.67">have to you know get your bucket that</span> <span data-start="487.67" data-end="490.1">holds data and walk to the lake go get</span> <span data-start="490.1" data-end="492.26">some data and walk back and while you</span> <span data-start="492.26" data-end="494.06">are walking to the lake you cannot do</span> <span data-start="494.06" data-end="496.91">anything else so in computing that means</span> <span data-start="496.91" data-end="498.47">that we tend to see this in the form of</span> <span data-start="498.47" data-end="501.17">iterators so walking to the lake and</span> <span data-start="501.17" data-end="503.15">back that's an iterator it's also</span> <span data-start="503.15" data-end="505.07">blocking when you're walking to the lake</span> <span data-start="505.07" data-end="507.23">and back you can't do anything else so</span> <span data-start="507.23" data-end="509.21">you also want to the costume curve that</span> <span data-start="509.21" data-end="511.52">is the timeout so you also want to never</span> <span data-start="511.52" data-end="514.28">ever block forever the one of my you</span> <span data-start="514.28" data-end="517.91">know should be on a t-shirt that when</span> <span data-start="517.91" data-end="520.01">you have pull streams you don't want to</span> <span data-start="520.01" data-end="521.39">block you don't want to send someone</span> <span data-start="521.39" data-end="523.55">from you know from the village to the</span> <span data-start="523.55" data-end="526.31">try to the lake and then you know feel</span> <span data-start="526.31" data-end="527.48">like okay well I guess I'll come back</span> <span data-start="527.48" data-end="529.1">and then like ten days later you still</span> <span data-start="529.1" data-end="531.32">haven't got any water I don't do that so</span> <span data-start="531.32" data-end="535.16">similarly with pull streams all right so</span> <span data-start="535.16" data-end="536.63">what do streams at the data structure</span> <span data-start="536.63" data-end="538.91">look like in JavaScript so as your data</span> <span data-start="538.91" data-end="539.81">structure lots</span> <span data-start="539.81" data-end="541.94">different instances of streams like</span> <span data-start="541.94" data-end="544.79">structures so node streams kamini named</span> <span data-start="544.79" data-end="547.67">they are pushed streams so no streams</span> <span data-start="547.67" data-end="549.89">this is the classic example from sub</span> <span data-start="549.89" data-end="551.66">stack who has a ton of awesome stream</span> <span data-start="551.66" data-end="554.6">examples so here is a very simple server</span> <span data-start="554.6" data-end="557.81">that reads a file and then sent the two</span> <span data-start="557.81" data-end="560.089">response here's the important bait so</span> <span data-start="560.089" data-end="561.98">what it's actually doing is this take</span> <span data-start="561.98" data-end="563.75">the final system reads the file into</span> <span data-start="563.75" data-end="566.36">memory and then it sends the response</span> <span data-start="566.36" data-end="569.93">out the data out to the response so</span> <span data-start="569.93" data-end="572.3">that's

data-end="589.91">the important bit is that the file</span> <span data-start="589.91" data-end="591.65">system we create a readable stream and</span> <span data-start="591.65" data-end="594.95">then

<span data-start="603.86" data-end="606.17">than using memory no streams are awesome</span> <span data-start="606.17" data-end="610.46">they're great generators generators are</span> <span data-start="610.46" data-end="614.39">a newer feature there in es2015 they are</span> <span data-start="614.39" data-end="617.99">reusable and possible functions or are</span> <span data-start="617.99" data-end="622.52">they pull streams indeed I would say</span> <span data-start="622.52" data-end="625.28">that because the way you operate on a</span> <span data-start="625.28" data-end="627.32">generator is that you asked for more</span> <span data-start="627.32" data-end="629.6">when you want more also known as pull</span> <span data-start="629.6" data-end="632.66">streams so you know it's a generator</span> <span data-start="632.66" data-end="634.91">when you see these kinds of indicators</span> <span data-start="634.91" data-end="636.56">that this might be a dinner so function</span> <span data-start="636.56" data-end="639.26">star and a yield if you see those in a</span> <span data-start="639.26" data-end="641.38">business that's going to be a generator</span> <span data-start="641.38" data-end="643.91">so here's a very simple generator it's a</span> <span data-start="643.91" data-end="646.01">reusable and possible function so this</span> <span data-start="646.01" data-end="649.16">does not do anything however if you</span> <span data-start="649.16" data-end="652.13">create an instance of a something so s</span> <span data-start="652.13"

data-end="666.279">have some some simple demos to show what</span> <span data-start="666.279" data-end="668.959">generators look like so some fun with</span> <span data-start="668.959"

going to</span> <span data-start="679.4" data-end="682.49">tack it to the right all right so we're</span> <span data-start="682.49" data-end="684.68">going to generate so generator done</span> <span

data-end="697.91">else entirely okay so say and then now</span> <span data-start="697.91" data-end="699.86">our generators done and if we continue</span> <span data-start="699.86" data-end="702.68">to

that</span> <span data-start="706.64" data-end="709.88">looks like in the simple generator so</span> <span data-start="709.88" data-end="711.26">our simple dinner we see that function</span> <span data-start="711.26" data-end="713.9">star and that yield those symptoms that</span> <span data-start="713.9" data-end="715.73">we have a generator going on and so in</span> <span data-start="715.73" data-end="717.62">the first time we call it we run it when</span> <span data-start="717.62" data-end="719.21">we call next we run up to the first this</span> <span data-start="719.21"

data-end="729.47">in the remainder of the generator it's a</span> <span data-start="729.47" data-end="731.21">great place to put finally and things</span> <span data-start="731.21" data-end="733.61">like that so now that you've seen the</span> <span data-start="733.61" data-end="735.11">code let's just look at it again just to</span> <span data-start="735.11" data-end="738.35">you know see it how it works and then</span> <span data-start="738.35" data-end="743.24">see it do the thing alright so let's</span> <span data-start="743.24" data-end="745.46">swap that out for a mildly less trivial</span> <span data-start="745.46" data-end="749.21">one so let's get rid it simple let's</span> <span data-start="749.21" data-end="751.7">change it to string breaker
