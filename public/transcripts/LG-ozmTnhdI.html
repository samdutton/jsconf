that it'll be more obvious as we're</span> <span data-start="310.71" data-end="313.71">going along so basically to create a</span> <span data-start="313.71" data-end="316.199">pair you would just call

okay great because we're just going</span> <span data-start="349.949" data-end="351.779">to keep digging deeper this is pretty</span> <span data-start="351.779" data-end="356.219">basic to this talk so then if you if you</span> <span data-start="356.219" data-end="358.349">know any Lisp and you've heard of car</span> <span data-start="358.349" data-end="362.009">cons cutter basically we want to have a</span> <span data-start="362.009" data-end="364.59">function that we can pass a pair rather</span> <span data-start="364.59" data-end="367.199">than have the pair be the function that</span> <span data-start="367.199" data-end="370.02">we pass anything else so we can wrap</span> <span data-start="370.02" data-end="372.06">that by saying car as a function that</span> <span data-start="372.06" data-end="375.63">takes a pair and then applies that pair</span> <span data-start="375.63" data-end="378.779">to first and cutter takes a pair and</span> <span data-start="378.779" data-end="381.27">applies it to second and then we can</span> <span data-start="381.27" data-end="384.9">just alias and this is basically you can</span> <span data-start="384.9" data-end="387.96">build up a list of like 1 2 3 4 5 and</span> <span data-start="387.96" data-end="390.75">then say give me the second of the</span> <span data-start="390.75" data-end="392.55">second of the first of the first and</span> <span data-start="392.55" data-end="394.469">we'll give you 3 or the first of the</span> <span data-start="394.469" data-end="395.99">first of the second of the second and</span> <span data-start="395.99" data-end="401.04">it'll give you a 3 is that makes sense</span> <span data-start="401.04" data-end="403.29">mind blown I thought that this was</span> <span data-start="403.29" data-end="405.93">absolutely crazy when I first found out</span> <span data-start="405.93" data-end="410.46">about this so a quick aside on currying</span> <span data-start="410.46" data-end="412.53">if you don't know what currying is</span> <span data-start="412.53" data-end="414.39">basically instead of having a function</span> <span data-start="414.39" data-end="416.7">that takes like five parameters you just</span> <span data-start="416.7" data-end="418.95">keep having nested functions and they</span> <span data-start="418.95" data-end="420.78">keep returning functions that take like</span> <span data-start="420.78" data-end="423.21">one extra parameter so basically instead</span> <span data-start="423.21"
