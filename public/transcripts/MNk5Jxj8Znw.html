data-start="36.51" data-end="38.76">lesson in here because i like to remind</span> <span data-start="38.76" data-end="41.7">people of where we came from and you</span> <span data-start="41.7" data-end="43.23">know i've been talking about open source</span> <span data-start="43.23" data-end="47.28">for almost 20 years now and i love it</span> <span data-start="47.28" data-end="49.649">that we that we won to the extent that</span> <span data-start="49.649" data-end="51.96">we have one but i noticed that if we</span> <span data-start="51.96" data-end="54.149">don't stay vigilant and keep reminding</span> <span data-start="54.149" data-end="56.76">people especially new people what's</span> <span data-start="56.76" data-end="59.67">happening we run the risk of losing it</span> <span data-start="59.67" data-end="62.94">again because it's a slippery slope it's</span> <span data-start="62.94" data-end="65.4">really easy to give up you know little</span> <span data-start="65.4" data-end="67.89">concessions along the way that the you</span> <span data-start="67.89" data-end="70.11">know add up to the end of open source so</span> <span data-start="70.11" data-end="72.56">we'll talk about that a little bit too</span> <span data-start="72.56" data-end="80.72">all right so jun 2014 I was at foo camp</span> <span data-start="80.72" data-end="84">which is a conference that Tim O'Reilly</span> <span data-start="84" data-end="86.67">gives it's an invitational conference in</span> <span data-start="86.67" data-end="89.79">his backyard and he literally pitch</span> <span data-start="89.79" data-end="93.36">tents and you know I was kind of minding</span> <span data-start="93.36" data-end="95.52">my own business in there and this guy</span> <span data-start="95.52" data-end="99.15">walks up to me this is michael rogers</span> <span data-start="99.15" data-end="102.899">and he has been caring about JavaScript</span> <span data-start="102.899" data-end="105.78">and and also know Jas for quite a long</span> <span data-start="105.78" data-end="108.99">time now and he wanted to understand</span> <span data-start="108.99" data-end="112.14">about copyright because there had just</span> <span data-start="112.14" data-end="114.78">been a change in the node community the</span> <span data-start="114.78" data-end="117.149">trademark holder of node had</span> <span data-start="117.149" data-end="120.719">unilaterally decided to stop aggregating</span> <span data-start="120.719" data-end="123.24">copyright that means you didn't have to</span> <span data-start="123.24" data-end="124.74">sign the little piece of paper anymore</span> <span data-start="124.74" data-end="127.77">to give a contribution and he wanted to</span> <span data-start="127.77" data-end="129.75">understand what the effect of that was</span> <span data-start="129.75" data-end="132.06">going to be and exactly what was going</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="132.7">to happen</span> <span data-start="132.7" data-end="137.59">next and as it happened I did know a</span> <span data-start="137.59" data-end="139.629">little bit about node and the reason</span> <span data-start="139.629" data-end="141.31">that I knew about note at all was</span> <span data-start="141.31" data-end="143.019">because I had gone to work a few months</span> <span data-start="143.019" data-end="148.48">earlier for paypal so paypal switched to</span> <span data-start="148.48" data-end="154.2">node in 2013 and they did this in a very</span> <span data-start="154.2" data-end="157.319">calculated way some of you may have seen</span> <span data-start="157.319" data-end="160.93">this gentleman talking about the switch</span> <span data-start="160.93" data-end="162.849">because he was kind of the architect of</span> <span data-start="162.849" data-end="165.4">it this is bill Scott he came from</span> <span data-start="165.4" data-end="168.459">netflix to paypal with the goal of</span> <span data-start="168.459" data-end="171.19">changing the way that paypal front ended</span> <span data-start="171.19" data-end="174.069">and he wanted to use this tool this tool</span> <span data-start="174.069" data-end="178.329">node and at the time at 2013 paypal was</span> <span data-start="178.329" data-end="181.78">still front ending in java and he's from</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="184.48">texas he's a really sweet guy and when</span> <span data-start="184.48" data-end="186.94">the people at PayPal that were nervous</span> <span data-start="186.94" data-end="190.51">about change asked him you know what he</span> <span data-start="190.51" data-end="194.2">was doing he said I'm just prototype in</span> <span data-start="194.2" data-end="197.109">you don't have to worry I'm just proud</span> <span data-start="197.109" data-end="200.319">to type in and he knew that eventually</span> <span data-start="200.319" data-end="201.97">this was going to end up being</span> <span data-start="201.97" data-end="204.01">production code but he also knew that</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="206.44">they weren't ready to hear it yet he</span> <span data-start="206.44" data-end="208.45">waited until the Java developers were</span> <span data-start="208.45" data-end="211.06">begging to be allowed to use node</span> <span data-start="211.06" data-end="214.51">because two people very small team were</span> <span data-start="214.51" data-end="217.45">able to get more done than like our team</span> <span data-start="217.45" data-end="220.049">of 25 people trying to front end in Java</span> <span data-start="220.049" data-end="222.609">and they were losing the race so they</span> <span data-start="222.609" data-end="225.37">wanted to switch to the other side so</span> <span data-start="225.37" data-end="228.16">anyway this is why I knew about it he</span> <span data-start="228.16" data-end="230.35">called me up and said I would like you</span> <span data-start="230.35" data-end="234.569">to talk to us about how to make our</span> <span data-start="234.569" data-end="237.15">contribution to the open source world</span> <span data-start="237.15" data-end="239.94">around node really successful and that</span> <span data-start="239.94" data-end="242.47">was the first you're going to do this</span> <span data-start="242.47" data-end="244.87">for me what are you doing oh that's</span> <span data-start="244.87" data-end="250.89">terrible Apple all right</span> <span data-start="250.9" data-end="256.13">so in 2014 we will they released Kraken</span> <span data-start="256.13" data-end="259.19">the beginning of the year I had helped</span> <span data-start="259.19" data-end="262.07">them with all the details of it to make</span> <span data-start="262.07" data-end="266.12">it have the best possible landing and I</span> <span data-start="266.12" data-end="268.43">did this as a consultant and lo and</span> <span data-start="268.43" data-end="271.49">behold it was really successful and they</span> <span data-start="271.49" data-end="272.93">listen to me carefully and they did</span> <span data-start="272.93" data-end="275.81">everything I told them to do so then</span> <span data-start="275.81" data-end="278.21">they said you should be an employee and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.21" data-end="281.33">I said well why would I do that I'm a</span> <span data-start="281.33" data-end="284.479">consultant I like my life and they they</span> <span data-start="284.479" data-end="286.43">basically made it so I couldn't say no</span> <span data-start="286.43" data-end="288.169">one of the things they did was they let</span> <span data-start="288.169" data-end="290.84">me keep my consultancy open so I have a</span> <span data-start="290.84" data-end="292.61">lot of interesting conversations with</span> <span data-start="292.61" data-end="297.44">people but back then when they released</span> <span data-start="297.44" data-end="299.9">Kraken which is a framework that sits on</span> <span data-start="299.9" data-end="303.13">top of express and mix node run at</span> <span data-start="303.13" data-end="307.31">PayPal scale which is lots and lots of</span> <span data-start="307.31" data-end="309.02">transactions especially at Christmas</span> <span data-start="309.02" data-end="313.25">time and it's kind of a bumper area so</span> <span data-start="313.25" data-end="315.139">that our developers have a lot of choice</span> <span data-start="315.139" data-end="317.09">they can pick whatever modules they</span> <span data-start="317.09" data-end="319.22">think they want to use but they can't</span> <span data-start="319.22" data-end="320.72">get in too much trouble because this</span> <span data-start="320.72" data-end="323.12">framework is keeping making sure that</span> <span data-start="323.12" data-end="327.56">they can run at scale this is a these</span> <span data-start="327.56" data-end="329.57">are the companies that were using node</span> <span data-start="329.57" data-end="332.63">in everyday work in 2014 when we</span> <span data-start="332.63" data-end="334.7">released crackin and this is from an</span> <span data-start="334.7" data-end="337.07">article that Joyent who's the trademark</span> <span data-start="337.07" data-end="340.22">holder was what you know put out and it</span>

data-end="354.229">ecosystem I noticed I noticed that</span> <span data-start="354.229" data-end="357.07">because somebody started a campaign of</span> <span data-start="357.07" data-end="359.84">people from the ecosystem introducing</span> <span data-start="359.84" data-end="362.78">themselves to me as I was joining paypal</span> <span data-start="362.78" data-end="364.52">because they were hoping that we would</span> <span data-start="364.52" data-end="366.139">do more for node that we would be more</span> <span data-start="366.139" data-end="368">interested in no time we we you know</span> <span data-start="368" data-end="370.46">keep lifting it Michael had already</span> <span data-start="370.46" data-end="371.96">explained to
