<p><span data-start="10.12" data-end="15.98">Yeah, as Aga mentioned, my name is Houssein, and I will be talking today about performance</span> <span data-start="15.98" data-end="17.38">empathy.</span> <span data-start="17.38" data-end="25.21">Empathy's a term we commonly use to describe the ability to understand and share the feelings</span> <span data-start="25.21" data-end="27.64">of another individual or a group.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="27.64" data-end="33.39">I like to think of the term "performance empathy" to be the same thing, but for the performance</span> <span data-start="33.39" data-end="38.55">concerns and issues of a particular site.</span> <span data-start="38.55" data-end="46.72">To explain why I thought it would be a good topic for a talk, I need first to describe</span> <span data-start="46.72" data-end="49.019">a bit more about myself.</span> <span data-start="49.019" data-end="52.739">I work as an advocate for the web team at Google.</span> <span data-start="52.739" data-end="58.289">Now, developer-advocates in many different companies usually act as a bridge between</span> <span data-start="58.289" data-end="63.87">a specific engineering community and a specific engineering team and a developer community.</span> <span data-start="63.87" data-end="69.89">Being an advocate for the web team means that it's my job to make sure the web gets better</span> <span data-start="69.89" data-end="71.52">and better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.52" data-end="79.74">I focus on speed and performance.</span> <span data-start="79.74" data-end="85.64">So a lot of advocates, we sometimes give advice that can seem a little overwhelming.</span> <span data-start="85.64" data-end="92.32">I don't know why my clicker feels weird!</span> <span data-start="92.32" data-end="103.01">There you go.</span> <span data-start="103.01" data-end="110.14">[Scattered laughter].</span> <span data-start="110.14" data-end="115.08">But in all seriousness why are so many performance advocates fascinated about what they do with</span> <span data-start="115.08" data-end="116.86">their own tool chains?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.86" data-end="120.93">Why are we so focused whether it will improve performance or not?</span> <span data-start="120.93" data-end="123.78">Why do we care performance that much to begin with?</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="127.44">Is it really that much of a problem?</span> <span data-start="127.44" data-end="132.22">To help us answer this question, let's look at this example of a site.</span> <span data-start="132.22" data-end="136.69">It's an entirely client-side rendered site that ships a megabyte of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="136.69" data-end="144.939">This means that the initial request only contains a shell of an HTML document.</span> <span data-start="144.939" data-end="150.14">Only after the JavaScript bundle finishes executing, the user gets to see any real content.</span> <span data-start="150.14" data-end="155.37">Now, in case you weren't counting, the amount of time it took for this app to finish loading</span> <span data-start="155.37" data-end="157.799">was about 19 seconds.</span> <span data-start="157.799" data-end="163.03">19 seconds isn't fast by any means.</span> <span data-start="163.03" data-end="168.08">So we know that one megabyte of JavaScript can seem like a lot to ship town to browsers.</span> <span data-start="168.08" data-end="170.749">How much are we generally shipping?</span> <span data-start="170.749" data-end="175.28">If we take a look at the HTTP archive, we can see the median amount of JavaScript we</span> <span data-start="175.28" data-end="182.28">are sending down the wire is about 350 kilobytes, and this for mobile web pages.</span> <span data-start="182.28" data-end="186.87">The reason this is such a big deal is because a lot of websites currently living in the</span> <span data-start="186.87" data-end="191.269">web that are either entirely static or they have little to no interactivity at all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="191.269" data-end="195.87">I thought it would be interesting to dive in a little deeper and see how much how much</span> <span data-start="195.87" data-end="201.67">site they use of a particular framework are shipping in terms of JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="201.67" data-end="207.099">And I did it with three frameworks to begin with: Angular, React, and Vue.</span> <span data-start="207.099" data-end="211.68">The reason I chose these three is because they are the most popular client-side frameworks</span> <span data-start="211.68" data-end="214.959">today to build our UI.</span> <span data-start="214.959" data-end="223.219">I found out after querying 250,000 origins, about 50 per cent of them ship over a megabyte</span> <span data-start="223.219" data-end="224.219">of JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="224.219" data-end="228.299">Now, each of these origins either use one or more of these frameworks.</span> <span data-start="228.299" data-end="233.969">There's a lot of reasons why this might be the case, but it does show that we are shipping</span> <span data-start="233.969" data-end="236.95">a lot of JavaScript if we are not entirely careful.</span> <span data-start="236.95" data-end="243.2">Now, what I want to do now is take a step back and talk about how I began the presentation.</span> <span data-start="243.2" data-end="248.549">You see, every single talk I've ever given before today has always followed the exact</span> <span data-start="248.549" data-end="254.569">same format: I begin with a word of caution, and talk about how performance is a pretty</span> <span data-start="254.569" data-end="255.59">big problem.</span> <span data-start="255.59" data-end="262.18">I then move on to showing some stats and some numbers to back up my claim, and I do this</span> <span data-start="262.18" data-end="266.61">to convey how much of a problem this actually is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.61" data-end="271.05">And then the rest of my talk usually follows the same sort of pattern where I talk about</span> <span data-start="271.05" data-end="275.96">different tips, different techniques, that you should be applying to make sure your site</span> <span data-start="275.96" data-end="279.979">stays as small as possible and as fast as possible.</span> <span data-start="279.979" data-end="282.849">For this talk, I'm going to go in a slightly different direction.</span> <span data-start="282.849" data-end="288.41">I want to talk about what we can do as advocates, and what we can do better to reach the community</span> <span data-start="288.41" data-end="292.82">better, as well as how we can all work together to try and think of different ways to to make</span> <span data-start="292.82" data-end="299.03">sure performance is a win for everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="299.03" data-end="303.8">Going back to that example of a site we just talked about, here I mentioned that, at the</span> <span data-start="303.8" data-end="311.669">end, I mentioned that we are running this on a mobile device and a slow 3G connection.</span> <span data-start="311.669" data-end="316.639">A lot of people when they trace performance, they talk about specific user conditions that</span> <span data-start="316.639" data-end="319.87">might not be the same as yours when you build your application.</span> <span data-start="319.87" data-end="325.72">And we do this because the fending on the user's device or network type, they can experience</span> <span data-start="325.72" data-end="328.61">your site a lot slower than you think.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="328.61" data-end="329.789">And there's more.</span> <span data-start="329.789" data-end="333.82">We sometimes talk about how your users might experience your site if they're completely</span> <span data-start="333.82" data-end="340.78">offline, or if they have a flaky network connection, or maybe they have a weaker device, on mobile,</span> <span data-start="340.78" data-end="342.55">so forth, and so on.</span> <span data-start="342.55" data-end="348.639">Although it is important to talk about all these scenarios and try to capture different</span> <span data-start="348.639" data-end="353.889">conditions your user might be in, the thing I want to make sure I mention is that you</span> <span data-start="353.889" data-end="356.55">know your users better than anyone else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.55" data-end="360.879">You definitely know your users better than any advocate that stands on stage telling</span> <span data-start="360.879" data-end="366.27">you how well your site performs under a certain condition.</span> <span data-start="366.27" data-end="372.69">That being said, one thing I want also to mention is the fact that nobody prioritises</span> <span data-start="372.69" data-end="374.49">performance over anything.</span> <span data-start="374.49" data-end="378.25">If you think about it, when you're trying to build a site, the very first thing you're</span> <span data-start="378.25" data-end="381.389">thinking about usually isn't performance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="381.389" data-end="383.349">Most people are like this.</span> <span data-start="383.349" data-end="387.55">But if you also think about it, why should someone make it the very top thing they think</span> <span data-start="387.55" data-end="389.72">about?</span> <span data-start="389.72" data-end="393.67">Let's talk about something to try and complain what I mean here.</span> <span data-start="393.67" data-end="396.79">Say you wake up one Monday morning and you have an amazing idea.</span> <span data-start="396.79" data-end="399.96">You've thought about a product you want to sell on the website or maybe you want to provide</span> <span data-start="399.96" data-end="401.78">a specific type of service.</span> <span data-start="401.78" data-end="406.629">So you're excited, and the next thing you naturally do is try to find out how to build</span> <span data-start="406.629" data-end="407.629">it.</span> <span data-start="407.629" data-end="411.52">You spend a little time researching the tools, the tips, the tricks that you need, maybe</span> <span data-start="411.52" data-end="416.02">you're building wire frames, maybe building graphics, so forth and so on, but only after</span> <span data-start="416.02" data-end="419.55">that, you actually start building.</span> <span data-start="419.55" data-end="426.08">And at this point, throughout the initial process, nobody really thinks about performance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="426.08" data-end="430.58">The thing that you actually most likely are thinking about is the fact that you want to</span> <span data-start="430.58" data-end="435.93">build a site that loads and does exactly what you expect it to do, but build it with as</span> <span data-start="435.93" data-end="440.74">minimal effort and as fast as possible.</span> <span data-start="440.74" data-end="446.919">A second possible scenario could be the fact that you join a brand new team as a developer.</span> <span data-start="446.919" data-end="453.13">Say the newest developer on a brand new team, and, when you get assigned your first ticket,</span> <span data-start="453.13" data-end="456.3">you're most likely going to try and familiarise yourself with the code base.</span> <span data-start="456.3" data-end="461.069">You will spend a little time trying to know where your components live, where the utilities</span> <span data-start="461.069" data-end="465.229">live, how the unit tests work, and so on.</span> <span data-start="465.229" data-end="468.77">Only after that, while you're doing that, you start building and working on your first</span> <span data-start="468.77" data-end="469.77">feature.</span> <span data-start="469.77" data-end="473.27">Maybe it's a small feature you're adding on a page, maybe it's a small bug that you're</span> <span data-start="473.27" data-end="474.27">working on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="474.27" data-end="477.93">But again, also, when you're in these shoes, you're not thinking about performance.</span> <span data-start="477.93" data-end="483.49">You're not think about what I'm building doesn't degrade the performance of my site.</span> <span data-start="483.49" data-end="488.159">No, it's the first thing you're doing, most likely trying to check every single box assigned</span> <span data-start="488.159" data-end="489.18">to you.</span> <span data-start="489.18" data-end="496.33">It's highly unlikely performance is on that list.</span> <span data-start="496.33" data-end="504.259">The way I like to think about awareness and performance in general, and how people are</span> <span data-start="504.259" data-end="509.03">aware of the performance and location of the site, I try to think of it as some sort of</span> <span data-start="509.03" data-end="510.95">scale.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="510.95" data-end="514.89">For example, let's say you're building something for the first time, or you're building something</span> <span data-start="514.89" data-end="518.39">for the umpteenth time which you're learning a brand new tool.</span> <span data-start="518.39" data-end="521.62">What you're going to be doing at this point is seeing how this tool works.</span> <span data-start="521.62" data-end="523.11">Does it do what you expect it to do?</span> <span data-start="523.11" data-end="527.31">You're going to learn the API, is it easy to plug into your site?</span> <span data-start="527.31" data-end="532.23">At this point, it's unlikely you're unlikely thinking how badly it's going to affect your</span> <span data-start="532.23" data-end="533.23">performance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="533.23" data-end="536.89">You're thinking how easy is it for me to use?</span> <span data-start="536.89" data-end="543.11">Let me spend some more time with that, and after a while, you end up launching your first</span> <span data-start="543.11" data-end="544.11">website.</span> <span data-start="544.11" data-end="548.4">You have an idea of how it works in development mode and how it works in production mode.</span> <span data-start="548.4" data-end="553.16">You have a better feeling whether it is really affecting performance or not, but you still</span> <span data-start="553.16" data-end="557.55">might be slightly unsure of what you need to do about it.</span> <span data-start="557.55" data-end="560.67">But the more and more you use this tool, and the more websites that you build, the more</span> <span data-start="560.67" data-end="566.63">familiar you are with how it affects the speed and reliability of your site.</span> <span data-start="566.63" data-end="571.82">That being said, nobody is more aware with the fact that they need to work on performance</span> <span data-start="571.82" data-end="574.649">than those that actually know they have issues.</span> <span data-start="574.649" data-end="580.49">If a significant per cent of your user base tells you we can't access your site because</span> <span data-start="580.49" data-end="586.209">it's too slow, you're most likely going to try and prioritise it as soon as possible.</span> <span data-start="586.209" data-end="589.24">This is what I mean by performance being an afterthought.</span> <span data-start="589.24" data-end="594.57">Maybe there are ways out there of it being not of something we only think of when it</span> <span data-start="594.57" data-end="597.31">is too late.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="597.31" data-end="601.279">Throughout this talk, I sort of this this dichotomy between two different users groups,</span> <span data-start="601.279" data-end="606.73">one being performance advocates like myself, and one being a normal developer working on</span> <span data-start="606.73" data-end="608.46">a regular codebase.</span> <span data-start="608.46" data-end="615.06">Now, advocates, I think we all agree on the fact that there are way too many slow sites,</span> <span data-start="615.06" data-end="619.84">and the reason why I think this is true is because we have our job because a lot of the</span> <span data-start="619.84" data-end="622.94">sites out there aren't as fast as they should be.</span> <span data-start="622.94" data-end="627.191">If every user accesses the website and felt like it was faster than it needed to be, we</span> <span data-start="627.191" data-end="629.589">wouldn't need to be doing what we do every day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="629.589" data-end="635.42">But there's another misconception, or another thought that sometimes gets misconstrued that</span> <span data-start="635.42" data-end="640.8">seems kind of weird, and it's the idea that developers are sloppy when they ship slow</span> <span data-start="640.8" data-end="641.8">experience.</span> <span data-start="641.8" data-end="646.16">I've seen the sentiment time to time, and I can't understand it, because a developer</span> <span data-start="646.16" data-end="651.55">working on a website, and it happens too bad too slow, it is usually one of three reasons.</span> <span data-start="651.55" data-end="657.07">One, they don't know it is too slow for their users, two, they know it's too slow but they</span> <span data-start="657.07" data-end="661.53">don't know how to fix it, or they haven't prioritised that yet, and, three, they know</span> <span data-start="661.53" data-end="664.44">it's too slow and they're actively working to effectively.</span> <span data-start="664.44" data-end="666.87">Indeed again is always relative.</span> <span data-start="666.87" data-end="671.3">Having an advocate tell you that you're not focusing on something very important to them</span> <span data-start="671.3" data-end="673.19">isn't always the best approach.</span> <span data-start="673.19" data-end="679.09">Now, on the other side of the coin, when we talk about a developer, when you're building</span> <span data-start="679.09" data-end="682.55">a website, you're most likely going to agree that you have a million things you can work</span> <span data-start="682.55" data-end="683.55">on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="683.55" data-end="686.36">Performance is just one of them.</span> <span data-start="686.36" data-end="689.99">But it's also another weird thought that I see sometimes floating around and it's the</span> <span data-start="689.99" data-end="694.3">idea that advocates, or performance advocates, specifically, are out of touch.</span> <span data-start="694.3" data-end="698.05">The reason why some people might think this is because of the fact that many performance</span> <span data-start="698.05" data-end="702.97">advocates will build small sample apps and show you how to optimise and some people will</span> <span data-start="702.97" data-end="708.35">feel it's not easy to do it with a massive codebase and a massive team where code is</span> <span data-start="708.35" data-end="710.339">being checked in everywhere.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="761.91" data-end="768.2">If it always gives you a better starting point, you will most likely always have more wiggle</span> <span data-start="768.2" data-end="772.91">room, and more room to play with where it will take you longer to reach a threshold</span> <span data-start="772.91" data-end="775.55">or performance and end up being slow.</span> <span data-start="775.55" data-end="781.69">And in terms of framework level, a lot of frameworks are looking into this already.</span> <span data-start="781.69" data-end="785.649">React has already been looking to try to improve React DOM and make the sites smaller.</span> <span data-start="785.649" data-end="792.55">Doing this a few different ways, one of them being simplifying its event system.</span> <span data-start="792.55" data-end="799.49">With Vue and Vue3, they are looking to reduce memory function and making things more tree-shakeable</span> <span data-start="799.49" data-end="802.79">where they can.</span> <span data-start="802.79" data-end="808.06">The Angular team is looking into building brand new rendering engine called Ivy, and</span> <span data-start="808.06" data-end="812.73">with it exploring ways to cut down the initial bundle size and also looking at ways of maybe</span> <span data-start="812.73" data-end="817.31">progressively heightening experiences when you have server render architectures.</span> <span data-start="817.31" data-end="826.4">React and Suspense is also doing the same thing.</span> <span data-start="826.4" data-end="833.149">And then there are metaframeworks, things like Next.js that allow you to do what you</span> <span data-start="833.149" data-end="836.51">want to do most of the time, write and build your component.</span> <span data-start="836.51" data-end="840.49">There are things that we tell people to do quite often.</span> </p>
