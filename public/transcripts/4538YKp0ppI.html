data-start="275.28" data-end="280.56">pirate things so easily so I want to</span> <span data-start="280.56" data-end="282.81">start with a bit of an interaction what</span> <span data-start="282.81" data-end="285.96">is the Semantic Web so um I assume most</span> <span data-start="285.96" data-end="288.48">of you have a very wake level of</span> <span data-start="288.48" data-end="290.91">knowledge so I'm really going into the</span> <span data-start="290.91" data-end="292.89">details but not too deep just deep</span> <span data-start="292.89" data-end="295.23">enough that you can follow the talk so</span> <span data-start="295.23" data-end="297.86">first of all bonus web well the web is</span> <span data-start="297.86" data-end="300.3">the web as you know what it's document</span> <span data-start="300.3" data-end="302.82">it slings it you know JavaScript me this</span> <span data-start="302.82" data-end="306.21">kind of things the Semantic Web however</span> <span data-start="306.21" data-end="309.18">is there a set of techniques that you</span> <span data-start="309.18" data-end="311.19">can apply to the web as we know it today</span> <span data-start="311.19" data-end="316.22">and basically on the you need the cable</span> <span data-start="316.22" data-end="323.1">hey you go yeah that's a problem so um</span> <span data-start="323.1" data-end="326.28">using the Semantic Web and we can enable</span> <span data-start="326.28" data-end="328.919">giving meaning to things and I will show</span> <span data-start="328.919" data-end="333.18">you how this looks like in a second here</span> <span data-start="333.18" data-end="334.56">in this slide you can see two phrases</span> <span data-start="334.56" data-end="336.72">one is I love internet and the second</span> <span data-start="336.72" data-end="338.97">one is I hard the internet so the</span> <span data-start="338.97" data-end="341.28">meaning of this phrase is exactly the</span> <span data-start="341.28" data-end="344.64">same the thing is the syntax has changed</span> <span data-start="344.64" data-end="349.02">that semantics still are the same so in</span> <span data-start="349.02" data-end="350.61">the Semantic Web it's all about giving</span> <span data-start="350.61" data-end="355.11">meaning to things html5 defines a</span> <span data-start="355.11" data-end="359.01">computer-readable syntax so yeah it's</span> <span data-start="359.01" data-end="362.49">you know image of a bunny with a pancake</span> <span data-start="362.49" data-end="365.37">on its head and you can see image blah</span> <span data-start="365.37" data-end="369.3">blah jpg but there's no meaning it's</span> <span data-start="369.3" data-end="371.76">just an image um you don't know what is</span> <span data-start="371.76" data-end="375.3">on the image or in the image so yeah</span> <span data-start="375.3" data-end="375.92">it's</span> <span data-start="375.92" data-end="379.64">meaningless more or less and now on</span> <span data-start="379.64" data-end="381.98">semantic web you can apply a meaning to</span> <span data-start="381.98" data-end="383.45">it so you can say this is an image and</span> <span data-start="383.45" data-end="385.55">on that image you got a funny man funny</span> <span data-start="385.55" data-end="389.12">bunny with a pancake on his head and if</span> <span data-start="389.12" data-end="391.61">you're browsing whatever search engine</span> <span data-start="391.61" data-end="396.17">that you prefer search for oolong if you</span> <span data-start="396.17" data-end="398.03">love this money you will find a couple</span> <span data-start="398.03" data-end="401.09">of really interesting photos approved</span> <span data-start="401.09" data-end="405.23">for all audiences so no worries yeah so</span> <span data-start="405.23" data-end="407.54">getting meaning to things saying well</span> <span data-start="407.54" data-end="409.4">this is an image but on this image I</span> <span data-start="409.4" data-end="414.14">have runny with a pancake on his head in</span> <span data-start="414.14" data-end="417.11">the romantic web it's all about triples</span> <span data-start="417.11" data-end="420.2">triples are basically a subject</span> <span data-start="420.2" data-end="422.96">predicate object object sorry so</span> <span data-start="422.96" data-end="426.56">javascript has good part who of you</span> <span data-start="426.56" data-end="430.73">agrees with that okay that's a good</span> <span data-start="430.73" data-end="433.46">question to ask you this conference that</span> <span data-start="433.46" data-end="436.01">was kept as bad part stop as Crawford in</span> <span data-start="436.01" data-end="440.18">here because people will not necessarily</span> <span data-start="440.18" data-end="444.02">agree on the bad parts but whatever so</span> <span data-start="444.02" data-end="445.55">this is just an example triple</span> <span data-start="445.55" data-end="451.1">javascript has good part so now let's go</span> <span data-start="451.1" data-end="454.45">a bit a little bit into real-world usage</span> <span data-start="454.45" data-end="457.28">you can see the object in this case is</span> <span data-start="457.28" data-end="461.18">yet another XKCD comic I give you a bit</span> <span data-start="461.18" data-end="462.65">of time to read the comic before I</span> <span data-start="462.65" data-end="466.1">continue it's probably pretty small but</span> <span data-start="466.1" data-end="469.28">it was released I think on on friday</span> <span data-start="469.28" data-end="471.68">night i finished few slides on friday</span> <span data-start="471.68" data-end="475.55">night for am so yeah this was just the</span> <span data-start="475.55" data-end="480.83">latest XKCD back then so yeah you can</span> <span data-start="480.83" data-end="483.08">see well this is an image you can see</span> <span data-start="483.08" data-end="485.21">the predicate is well it has a license</span> <span data-start="485.21" data-end="488.9">and then you can see the object which is</span> <span data-start="488.9" data-end="494.05">in this case the Creative Commons 2.5</span> <span data-start="494.05" data-end="496.31">what's the exact name I'm not really</span> <span data-start="496.31" data-end="499.01">sure so share remix attribution and</span> <span data-start="499.01" data-end="502.7">non-commercial license so basically this</span> <span data-start="502.7" data-end="505.1">license says well let you get this image</span> <span data-start="505.1" data-end="507.1">you can share</span> <span data-start="507.1" data-end="510.44">which I'm doing today and you can remix</span> <span data-start="510.44" data-end="513.2">it which i would do if i added a pixel</span> <span data-start="513.2" data-end="516.95">somewhere here if you attribute it this</span> <span data-start="516.95" data-end="519.38">is what i did here so i said well it's</span> <span data-start="519.38" data-end="521.57">not mine i have not created it this is</span> <span data-start="521.57" data-end="523.72">the URL but very where you can get it</span> <span data-start="523.72" data-end="527.81">and yeah you may not use it commercially</span> <span data-start="527.81" data-end="530.99">so I'm not paid for being mia so I guess</span> <span data-start="530.99" data-end="534.41">this qualifies as non-commercial we use</span> <span data-start="534.41" data-end="540.98">of this image so I said real world so</span> <span data-start="540.98" data-end="543.86">let's have a look at the HTML code that</span> <span data-start="543.86" data-end="546.47">generated this image this is really</span> <span data-start="546.47" data-end="548.6">coming from side so don't get scared by</span> <span data-start="548.6" data-end="551.87">the yeah text this is basically the</span> <span data-start="551.87" data-end="554.779">mouse over text for this image and you</span> <span data-start="554.779" data-end="556.73">can see well it's an image tag it has a</span> <span data-start="556.73" data-end="560.75">source tag it has a title it has an alt</span> <span data-start="560.75" data-end="563.93">attribute and then you can see we get a</span> <span data-start="563.93" data-end="566.899">link down there that says well it's</span> <span data-start="566.899" data-end="570.86">linked to a license with the relation of</span> <span data-start="570.86" data-end="574.399">license so this is already good the</span> <span data-start="574.399" data-end="576.89">problem is well this license does it</span> <span data-start="576.89" data-end="578.959">apply to the side where the images</span> <span data-start="578.959" data-end="581.26">contain so basically it does it apply to</span> <span data-start="581.26" data-end="585.23">let's go back here does it apply to XKCD</span> <span data-start="585.23" data-end="589.55">com / blah blah so 797 or does it apply</span> <span data-start="589.55" data-end="593.54">to just the image itself we don't know</span> <span data-start="593.54" data-end="597.529">so let's see how using semantic web</span> <span data-start="597.529" data-end="599.81">technologies and in this case I'm only</span> <span data-start="599.81" data-end="603.079">talking about rdfa and you can do this</span> <span data-start="603.079" data-end="607.07">so you've probably seen it I've added a</span> <span data-start="607.07" data-end="611.48">little bit let's highlight it so now</span> <span data-start="611.48" data-end="614.24">with this about attribute you can see</span> <span data-start="614.24" data-end="617.3">well we get images XKCD com blah blah</span> <span data-start="617.3" data-end="621.02">about and then you can see well this is</span> <span data-start="621.02" data-end="623.48">a license that applies to exactly this</span> <span data-start="623.48" data-end="626.12">image so you can see this is not really</span> <span data-start="626.12" data-end="628.339">magic this is just yet another attribute</span> <span data-start="628.339" data-end="633.139">that gets added to the HTML code</span> <span data-start="633.139" data-end="635.389">and yeah this is basically all what</span> <span data-start="635.389" data-end="638.689">already if a is about so RDF move us has</span> <span data-start="638.689" data-end="642.949">heard of RDF okay yeah this roars</span> <span data-start="642.949" data-end="645.079">description framework a lot of people</span> <span data-start="645.079" data-end="649.309">turn away by if XML is one serialization</span> <span data-start="649.309" data-end="652.04">but for the web people multi-tech use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="652.04" data-end="655.699">RDF a which is yeah putting things</span> <span data-start="655.699" data-end="657.589">putting the but the triple information</span> <span data-start="657.589" data-end="660.709">into attributes that's a 4 that's what</span> <span data-start="660.709" data-end="664.339">the a stands for all ready fa you can</span> <span data-start="664.339" data-end="666.29">see about in this case it was as easy as</span> <span data-start="666.29" data-end="669.35">just adding one about attribute to this</span> <span data-start="669.35" data-end="671.809">tag and here you go now we have exactly</span> <span data-start="671.809" data-end="674.509">defined well this is the license for the</span> <span data-start="674.509" data-end="676.79">image not the page but for the image</span> <span data-start="676.79" data-end="680.839">which in this case could be added to the</span> <span data-start="680.839" data-end="685.91">side but yeah a lot of people currently</span> <span data-start="685.91" data-end="688.97">if they use license information have</span> <span data-start="688.97" data-end="691.16">this kind of license which is which is</span> <span data-start="691.16" data-end="693.949">already great so basically they say</span> <span data-start="693.949" data-end="696.589">about it you may use the side and by the</span> <span data-start="696.589" data-end="699.199">side most people think of the side and</span> <span data-start="699.199"
