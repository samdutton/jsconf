data-end="17.98">doing okay thanks for asking oh no I'm</span> <span data-start="17.98" data-end="19.57">actually really really stoked to be here</span> <span data-start="19.57" data-end="22.84">because I love Hawaii I love going to</span> <span data-start="22.84" data-end="25.239">the beach and surfing and doing things</span> <span data-start="25.239" data-end="28.09">in the ocean this is me on a recent</span> <span data-start="28.09" data-end="31.57">scuba trip here but a recreational</span> <span data-start="31.57" data-end="34">diving doesn't really pay the bills so I</span> <span data-start="34" data-end="35.62">do a little bit of software engineering</span> <span data-start="35.62" data-end="38.8">on the side and my first engineering job</span> <span data-start="38.8" data-end="42.28">was in 2015 where I worked at an unnamed</span> <span data-start="42.28" data-end="45.73">company I'd been coding small things on</span> <span data-start="45.73" data-end="47.079">my own like Neopets</span> <span data-start="47.079" data-end="49.39">storefronts and myspace fiends since I</span> <span data-start="49.39" data-end="51.879">was a teenager but this was my yeah who</span> <span data-start="51.879" data-end="53.469">knew pets or once I moved from MySpace</span> <span data-start="53.469" data-end="56.499">either way this is my first time working</span> <span data-start="56.499" data-end="58.809">on a team and building a capital P</span> <span data-start="58.809" data-end="60.789">product and this was also my first</span> <span data-start="60.789" data-end="63.339">introduction to graph QL so show of</span> <span data-start="63.339" data-end="65.53">hands how many people here have worked</span> <span data-start="65.53" data-end="69.07">with graph QL before cool cool cool so</span> <span data-start="69.07" data-end="72.19">yeah graph QL is a query language in an</span> <span data-start="72.19" data-end="75.52">application it fits in the API layer</span> <span data-start="75.52" data-end="78.01">much like rest does how many people here</span> <span data-start="78.01" data-end="81.64">have worked with REST API s how many</span> <span data-start="81.64" data-end="84.07">people here worked with graph QL before</span> <span data-start="84.07" data-end="87.85">they ever worked with a REST API handle</span> <span data-start="87.85" data-end="90.52">nice but yeah I still think it's unusual</span> <span data-start="90.52" data-end="93.04">to have this experience of learning and</span> <span data-start="93.04" data-end="95.53">working with graph QL first and I think</span> <span data-start="95.53" data-end="97.72">that that early exposure set the</span> <span data-start="97.72" data-end="100.12">foundation for how I view product</span> <span data-start="100.12" data-end="102.1">development overall and this is a</span> <span data-start="102.1" data-end="108.069">picture of me realizing that</span> <span data-start="108.079" data-end="110.579">imagine if your first introduction to</span> <span data-start="110.579" data-end="112.38">web development was through something</span> <span data-start="112.38" data-end="114.119">like react and I'm sure that for many of</span> <span data-start="114.119" data-end="115.77">you you don't even have to imagine that</span> <span data-start="115.77" data-end="118.5">but you'd probably understand that that</span> <span data-start="118.5" data-end="120.179">kind of introduction left a unique</span> <span data-start="120.179" data-end="122.819">impression on you and it molded your way</span> <span data-start="122.819" data-end="124.89">of thinking about web app development</span> <span data-start="124.89" data-end="126.99">right and I think that that's the case</span> <span data-start="126.99" data-end="128.94">with me and Graziella and product</span> <span data-start="128.94" data-end="132.93">development as well so in the first</span> <span data-start="132.93" data-end="134.879">engineering job I worked on recruiting</span> <span data-start="134.879" data-end="137.16">products we built a suite of products</span> <span data-start="137.16" data-end="140.099">and tools that our recruiters used to do</span> <span data-start="140.099" data-end="142.2">their jobs in my sound kind of</span> <span data-start="142.2" data-end="143.94">surprising but for a company of that</span> <span data-start="143.94" data-end="146.15">size that recruits on that scale</span> <span data-start="146.15" data-end="149.099">greenhouse just doesn't cut it so it's</span> <span data-start="149.099" data-end="150.54">actually a cost saver to have an</span> <span data-start="150.54" data-end="152.61">internal team building those tools for</span> <span data-start="152.61" data-end="155.43">you and for recruiting that statement is</span> <span data-start="155.43" data-end="158.61">true partly because of the scale that we</span> <span data-start="158.61" data-end="160.5">were dealing with like more than a</span> <span data-start="160.5" data-end="162.48">million candidates in our pool thousands</span> <span data-start="162.48" data-end="164.579">of interviews every day hundreds of</span> <span data-start="164.579"

<span data-start="314.59" data-end="316.63">hope to convince you of this that graph</span> <span data-start="316.63" data-end="319.15">2l gives product teams superpowers by</span> <span

data-end="335.23">grateful that Shawn showed you all some</span> <span data-start="335.23" data-end="336.91">cool graphic UL stuff yesterday because</span> <span data-start="336.91"

data-end="344.32">was a query language it's also a runtime</span> <span data-start="344.32" data-end="347.5">for fulfilling those queries so to be</span> <span data-start="347.5" data-end="349.36">clear it's not a programming language</span> <span data-start="349.36" data-end="352.21">and it's not a graph database in fact</span> <span data-start="352.21" data-end="354.22">graph GL was pretty agnostic about both</span> <span data-start="354.22" data-end="356.61">of these things there are graph QL</span> <span data-start="356.61" data-end="359.08">implementations out there in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="362.55">obviously but also ruby scala closure</span> <span data-start="362.55" data-end="364.27">doesn't care what programming language</span> <span data-start="364.27" data-end="366.7">you implement it in and you can use</span> <span data-start="366.7"

data-end="410.05">need to know to get started so changing</span> <span data-start="410.05" data-end="412.15">teams got me curious about different</span> <span data-start="412.15" data-end="413.98">product development philosophies out</span> <span data-start="413.98" data-end="416.11">there and eventually I came across one</span> <span data-start="416.11"

so</span> <span data-start="451.42" data-end="453.37">don't worry if these go fast I just want</span> <span data-start="453.37" data-end="456.19">to let you know what's coming the first</span> <span data-start="456.19" data-end="458.29">strategy is finding the important parts</span> <span data-start="458.29" data-end="460.96">of the problem second strategy</span> <span data-start="460.96" data-end="464.38">oops second one is creating a model that</span> <span data-start="464.38" data-end="468.1">solves that problem then we collaborate</span> <span data-start="468.1" data-end="470.65">to using a shared language to build a</span> <span data-start="470.65" data-end="473.77">better model we make sure to separate</span> <span data-start="473.77" data-end="476.05">our
