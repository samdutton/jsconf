<p><span data-start="18.89" data-end="21.75">so today I'm going to talk about react</span> <span data-start="21.75" data-end="24.33">which is a JavaScript library that I</span> <span data-start="24.33" data-end="27.39">work on and we announced the open</span> <span data-start="27.39" data-end="30.96">sourcing at Jas conf us in May and we</span> <span data-start="30.96" data-end="35.19">got some sarcastic reactions to it that</span> <span data-start="35.19" data-end="38.78">this tweet was was not a compliment</span> <span data-start="38.78" data-end="41.969">so we basically challenged some kind of</span> <span data-start="41.969" data-end="46.44">conventional wisdom with react so as we</span> <span data-start="46.44" data-end="48.12">talked about it I'd appreciate it if you</span> <span data-start="48.12" data-end="50.49">gave it five minutes we've used this for</span> <span data-start="50.49" data-end="52.89">a lot of big applications on big teams</span> <span data-start="52.89" data-end="54.989">and it's worked really well for us so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="54.989" data-end="57.69">I'm going to focus not on kind of</span> <span data-start="57.69" data-end="60.03">teaching you how to use react and build</span> <span data-start="60.03" data-end="62.01">applications with it because you can go</span> <span data-start="62.01" data-end="63.57">online and look at our tutorials in our</span> <span data-start="63.57" data-end="66.03">videos I'm going to instead focus on the</span> <span data-start="66.03" data-end="68.729">design decisions behind what we did why</span> <span data-start="68.729" data-end="71.04">we did that and you know even if you</span> <span data-start="71.04" data-end="73.259">don't use react maybe you can can take</span> <span data-start="73.259" data-end="74.82">those decisions and apply them to your</span> <span data-start="74.82" data-end="79.86">own projects so react we call it a</span> <span data-start="79.86" data-end="83.4">library for creating user interfaces to</span> <span data-start="83.4" data-end="84.96">get more specific that means that we</span> <span data-start="84.96" data-end="87.54">render your UI and we respond to two</span> <span data-start="87.54" data-end="90.03">events in the browser you can think of</span> <span data-start="90.03" data-end="92.909">it as the V and MVC you might want to</span> <span data-start="92.909" data-end="94.17">think of it as the controller as well</span> <span data-start="94.17" data-end="96.29">depending on your definition of MVC</span> <span data-start="96.29" data-end="98.52">but there's a big focus on playing</span> <span data-start="98.52" data-end="100.47">nicely with your stack whatever it is so</span> <span data-start="100.47" data-end="102.869">a lot of the early react success stories</span> <span data-start="102.869" data-end="105.39">were existing projects that dropped it</span> <span data-start="105.39" data-end="107.31">in on a small part of their app and they</span> <span data-start="107.31" data-end="108.78">started using it for more and more of</span> <span data-start="108.78" data-end="112.2">their application as time went on so</span> <span data-start="112.2" data-end="113.88">we're going to talk about a couple</span> <span data-start="113.88" data-end="116.4">things today the first is that I'm going</span> <span data-start="116.4" data-end="120.299">to focus on some prerequisites so we</span> <span data-start="120.299" data-end="122.07">like to combine the dom generation and</span> <span data-start="122.07" data-end="123.96">display logic rather than using a</span> <span data-start="123.96" data-end="125.909">templating system and a lot of people</span> <span data-start="125.909" data-end="127.17">don't agree with that and i wanted to</span> <span data-start="127.17" data-end="129">explain why we think that that's a great</span> <span data-start="129" data-end="131.79">idea then i'm going to go into reacts</span> <span data-start="131.79" data-end="134.04">design so what makes building</span> <span data-start="134.04" data-end="136.29">applications with react really really</span> <span data-start="136.29" data-end="139.799">fun and easy and the core idea there is</span> <span data-start="139.799" data-end="142.349">we basically rerender the app every time</span> <span data-start="142.349" data-end="145.92">the data changes and finally what a lot</span> <span data-start="145.92" data-end="147.39">of people are really interested in is</span> <span data-start="147.39" data-end="147.76">our</span> <span data-start="147.76" data-end="149.86">unique implementation so we've built</span> <span data-start="149.86" data-end="151.42">this javascript library from the ground</span> <span data-start="151.42" data-end="154.09">up using a lot of different ideas than</span> <span data-start="154.09" data-end="155.56">other libraries so I'd like to talk</span> <span data-start="155.56" data-end="157.049">about that too</span> <span data-start="157.049" data-end="159.73">so let's dive into the first thing which</span> <span data-start="159.73" data-end="161.95">is building components and not templates</span> <span data-start="161.95" data-end="164.799">so I'm sure everyone here is built a UI</span> <span data-start="164.799" data-end="167.37">with JavaScript before right everyone</span> <span data-start="167.37" data-end="170.049">has anybody used a client-side</span> <span data-start="170.049" data-end="172.659">templating library like handlebars is a</span> <span data-start="172.659" data-end="175.569">really high-quality one a lot of people</span> <span data-start="175.569" data-end="178.569">use them on the server as well so</span> <span data-start="178.569" data-end="180.94">cynically we like to think of components</span> <span data-start="180.94" data-end="184.599">as mixing markup and display logic but</span> <span data-start="184.599" data-end="186.28">we do like separation of concerns right</span> <span data-start="186.28" data-end="187.75">let's kind of the number one reason for</span> <span data-start="187.75" data-end="190.51">using a template so a templating</span> <span data-start="190.51" data-end="191.98">language basically takes in a data</span> <span data-start="191.98" data-end="195.37">structure and combines it with an HTML</span> <span data-start="195.37" data-end="196.75">document marked up with some special</span> <span data-start="196.75" data-end="198.909">directives and spits out some static</span> <span data-start="198.909" data-end="204.04">markup but separation of concerns really</span> <span data-start="204.04" data-end="207.22">isn't a specific term right like what</span> <span data-start="207.22" data-end="208.9">are concerns there it's very ill-defined</span> <span data-start="208.9" data-end="210.97">so I'd like to kind of zoom in on this</span> <span data-start="210.97" data-end="213.22">definition and talk about coupling and</span> <span data-start="213.22" data-end="216.04">cohesion so these are terms from</span> <span data-start="216.04" data-end="218.68">software engineering and we're talking</span> <span data-start="218.68" data-end="221.019">about reducing coupling and increasing</span> <span data-start="221.019" data-end="225.579">cohesion so coupling is the degree to</span> <span data-start="225.579" data-end="228.099">which each module in a program relies on</span> <span data-start="228.099" data-end="232.03">the other modules in a program so think</span> <span data-start="232.03" data-end="234.129">about the really annoying bugs or</span> <span data-start="234.129" data-end="236.169">features that you had to build in your</span> <span data-start="236.169" data-end="239.079">day-to-day like work usually the ones</span> <span data-start="239.079" data-end="240.97">that are constrained to a single</span> <span data-start="240.97" data-end="242.41">function are pretty easy to deal with</span> <span data-start="242.41" data-end="244.329">right you go in you isolate where the</span> <span data-start="244.329" data-end="246.849">problem is you fix that function or that</span> <span data-start="246.849" data-end="248.79">class and you move on you with your life</span> <span data-start="248.79" data-end="251.379">maybe add a unit test to to make sure</span> <span data-start="251.379" data-end="255.28">that it doesn't happen again the really</span> <span data-start="255.28" data-end="257.409">painful bugs and features are the ones</span> <span data-start="257.409" data-end="259.989">that you have to make changes to</span> <span data-start="259.989" data-end="262.479">multiple modules so we like to call</span> <span data-start="262.479" data-end="263.919">these cascading changes and they're a</span> <span data-start="263.919" data-end="268.78">symptom of tight coupling so kind of the</span> <span data-start="268.78" data-end="270.13">way I think of coupling is that if I</span> <span data-start="270.13" data-end="271.539">want to make a change to some piece of</span> <span data-start="271.539" data-end="273.849">functionality do I have to make a change</span> <span data-start="273.849" data-end="275.59">to this module and does it affect all</span> <span data-start="275.59" data-end="277.479">the other modules requiring me to make</span> <span data-start="277.479" data-end="279.969">changes to them and that's what makes</span> <span data-start="279.969" data-end="282.94">software really hard to maintain</span> <span data-start="282.94" data-end="285.01">another term that we like to think about</span> <span data-start="285.01" data-end="287.68">is cohesion so cohesion is the degree to</span> <span data-start="287.68" data-end="289.24">which elements of a module belong</span> <span data-start="289.24" data-end="291.07">together so you can have the most</span> <span data-start="291.07" data-end="294.97">decoupled architecture ever but if those</span> <span data-start="294.97" data-end="297.82">modules don't really make sense in terms</span> <span data-start="297.82" data-end="299.38">of the functionality that they contain</span> <span data-start="299.38" data-end="301.419">it's also not going to be maintainable</span> <span data-start="301.419" data-end="302.56">because it's going to be hard for you to</span> <span data-start="302.56" data-end="304.84">figure out you know where to make the</span> <span data-start="304.84" data-end="306.4">change because those concerns are kind</span> <span data-start="306.4" data-end="316.97">of spread all over your program whoops</span> <span data-start="316.97" data-end="320.75">so I think that templates encourage a</span> <span data-start="320.75" data-end="322.79">really poor separation of concerns and</span> <span data-start="322.79" data-end="324.65">it's not just templates it's anything</span> <span data-start="324.65" data-end="327.26">that really tries to markup an HTML</span> <span data-start="327.26" data-end="329.78">document and you know make it alive and</span> <span data-start="329.78" data-end="331.58">really make it interactive</span> <span data-start="331.58" data-end="334.88">so angularjs style directives also fall</span> <span data-start="334.88" data-end="338.96">into this category and why would I say</span> <span data-start="338.96" data-end="340.88">that because obviously when you create a</span> <span data-start="340.88" data-end="342.29">template and you have your display logic</span> <span data-start="342.29" data-end="344.18">in one file and your markup in another</span> <span data-start="344.18" data-end="345.86">file that seems like a reasonable</span> <span data-start="345.86" data-end="348.29">separation of concerns right when I want</span> <span data-start="348.29" data-end="349.43">to change the way that the application</span> <span data-start="349.43" data-end="351.62">behaves I go to the JavaScript file with</span> <span data-start="351.62" data-end="353.48">the display logic and when I want to</span> <span data-start="353.48" data-end="354.95">change the way that it looks I go into</span> <span data-start="354.95" data-end="356.24">the template and change the template</span> <span data-start="356.24" data-end="359.75">right it's actually kind of a</span> <span data-start="359.75" data-end="361.97">misunderstanding because there is an</span> <span data-start="361.97" data-end="363.89">implicit coupling between that display</span> <span data-start="363.89" data-end="366.41">logic in the template so the template is</span> <span data-start="366.41" data-end="367.76">always going to need to read some data</span> <span data-start="367.76" data-end="370.43">from JavaScript write JavaScript fetches</span> <span data-start="370.43" data-end="372.62">from the server tells the template what</span> <span data-start="372.62" data-end="374.02">to do and then the template renders it</span> <span data-start="374.02" data-end="375.95">however imagine that I wanted to</span> <span data-start="375.95" data-end="377.84">implement a zebra-striped</span> <span data-start="377.84" data-end="379.91">table so it's a data table with</span> <span data-start="379.91" data-end="383.03">alternating row colors with a template a</span> <span data-start="383.03" data-end="385.25">lot of times you have to pass along that</span> <span data-start="385.25" data-end="388.28">row color in your view model which is</span> <span data-start="388.28" data-end="389.54">the piece of data that your your</span> <span data-start="389.54" data-end="391.94">controller or your display logic passes</span> <span data-start="391.94" data-end="394.79">to your template now if you want to</span> <span data-start="394.79" data-end="395.75">change the way that that template</span> <span data-start="395.75" data-end="398.24">renders you can't actually only change</span> <span data-start="398.24" data-end="399.89">the template anymore because you have to</span> <span data-start="399.89" data-end="401.48">make sure that the data in your view</span> <span data-start="401.48" data-end="404.27">model is synced between the template and</span> <span data-start="404.27" data-end="407.33">the display logic so we actually like to</span> <span data-start="407.33" data-end="409.04">think of display logic and markup as</span> <span data-start="409.04" data-end="412.01">inevitably tightly coupled because you</span> <span data-start="412.01" data-end="414.169">basically need to update the Dom somehow</span> <span data-start="414.169" data-end="417.32">and you need to somehow couple the state</span> <span data-start="417.32" data-end="421.16">of the Dom with your display logic but</span> <span data-start="421.16" data-end="422.15">the good news is is that they're</span> <span data-start="422.15" data-end="423.8">actually highly cohesive because they're</span> <span data-start="423.8" data-end="426.26">doing the same thing right so think</span> <span data-start="426.26" data-end="429.32">about what your template does your</span> <span data-start="429.32" data-end="431.6">template generates HTML the browser</span> <span data-start="431.6" data-end="435.71">parses the HTML into dom nodes then your</span> <span data-start="435.71" data-end="438.26">display logic just manipulates dom nodes</span> <span data-start="438.26" data-end="440.21">so they're doing basically the same</span> <span data-start="440.21" data-end="442.88">thing they're both rendering the UI to</span> <span data-start="442.88" data-end="445.58">dom data structures so what we're</span> <span data-start="445.58" data-end="446.539">actually doing when we're using</span> <span data-start="446.539" data-end="448.31">templates and display logic and</span> <span data-start="448.31" data-end="449.98">separating those out we're set</span> <span data-start="449.98" data-end="454.36">technology's not concerns and the</span> <span data-start="454.36" data-end="455.38">problem with this is that the</span> <span data-start="455.38" data-end="458.05">technologies that we're separating are</span> <span data-start="458.05" data-end="466.06">deliberately underpowered so I'm going</span> <span data-start="466.06" data-end="468.16">to pick on handlebars for a second which</span> <span data-start="468.16" data-end="470.89">is an extremely popular open-source</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="470.89" data-end="473.02">JavaScript templating solution and it's</span> <span data-start="473.02" data-end="475.03">a great one it's really fast it solves a</span> <span data-start="475.03" data-end="477.37">lot of people's use cases but it falls</span> <span data-start="477.37" data-end="480.16">into the common trap of templates which</span> <span data-start="480.16" data-end="483.28">is you rely on primitive abstractions so</span> <span data-start="483.28" data-end="484.72">for example if you want to reuse a</span> <span data-start="484.72" data-end="488.02">template the kind of standard way to do</span> <span data-start="488.02" data-end="490">it in handlebars is to use something</span> <span data-start="490" data-end="493.66">called a partial and a partial is a mini</span> <span data-start="493.66" data-end="495.34">template that you can include in other</span> <span data-start="495.34" data-end="498.07">templates so think of if you wanted a</span> <span data-start="498.07" data-end="500.11">profile pic component on a social</span> <span data-start="500.11" data-end="502.36">network and you reuse it all over the</span> <span data-start="502.36" data-end="503.41">place you would use a partial to</span> <span data-start="503.41" data-end="506.35">implement that now the problem is you're</span> <span data-start="506.35" data-end="508.93">basically copying and pasting in this</span> <span data-start="508.93" data-end="510.79">partial into a template and it gets all</span> <span data-start="510.79" data-end="512.89">of the variables that the parent has in</span> <span data-start="512.89" data-end="515.71">the in the current scope this is a whole</span> <span data-start="515.71" data-end="518.14">bunch of implicit dependencies now so</span> <span data-start="518.14" data-end="520.21">because the the child template or the</span> <span data-start="520.21" data-end="521.979">partial may be reading from any one of</span> <span data-start="521.979" data-end="523.93">these variables you have to go track</span> <span data-start="523.93" data-end="525.76">down every single call site that the</span> <span data-start="525.76" data-end="527.95">partial is being used in order to make</span> <span data-start="527.95" data-end="530.8">sure that it's you know being updated</span> <span data-start="530.8" data-end="532.18">correctly when you want to make a change</span> <span data-start="532.18" data-end="535">to the partial and another symptom is</span> <span data-start="535" data-end="536.59">relying on kind of flow control</span> <span data-start="536.59" data-end="541">abstractions like each so each basically</span> <span data-start="541" data-end="542.56">iterates through each item of a sequence</span> <span data-start="542.56" data-end="545.29">and emits some markup in a traditional</span> <span data-start="545.29" data-end="548.38">templating language what if you want to</span> <span data-start="548.38" data-end="550.3">kind of change the way that you iterate</span> <span data-start="550.3" data-end="551.89">over the list or what if you want to</span> <span data-start="551.89" data-end="554.59">insert two pieces of markup where the</span> <span data-start="554.59" data-end="555.67">templating language only thought you</span> <span data-start="555.67" data-end="558.88">would want to do one per list item it's</span> <span data-start="558.88" data-end="560.65">it's just difficult to deal with because</span> <span data-start="560.65" data-end="562.51">you don't have the power of a full</span> <span data-start="562.51" data-end="564.19">programming language you have the power</span> <span data-start="564.19" data-end="565.93">of a
