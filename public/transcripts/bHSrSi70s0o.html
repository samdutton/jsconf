<p><span data-start="386.4" data-end="388.199">Wozniak he basically designed the</span> <span data-start="388.199" data-end="389.969">program by putting different chips on</span> <span

data-start="398.569" data-end="401.339">wherever you know where computers used</span> <span data-start="401.339" data-end="403.289">to be you know literally pieces of</span> <span data-start="403.289" data-end="404.669">hardware that you glued together and</span> <span data-start="404.669" data-end="406.259">where you know we have the term bug</span> <span data-start="406.259"

that kind of kind of</span> <span data-start="421.07" data-end="424.01">takes this glues this all together is is</span> <span data-start="424.01" data-end="425.48">a project that i saw on kickstarter</span> <span data-start="425.48" data-end="428">called the good night light and i think</span> <span data-start="428" data-end="429.8">this is a really interesting example is</span> <span data-start="429.8" data-end="431.33">because it's taken something is really</span> <span data-start="431.33" data-end="433.52">simple it's a light and it's only light</span> <span data-start="433.52" data-end="435.26">and it's made it really interesting</span> <span data-start="435.26" data-end="437.99">using the the things that I've just</span> <span data-start="437.99" data-end="439.94">talked about the computation and</span> <span data-start="439.94" data-end="442.94">connectivity so this light is you buy</span> <span data-start="442.94" data-end="446.24">them in a pair and it has it has a twist</span> <span data-start="446.24" data-end="448.43">and so in that you could maybe a little</span> <span data-start="448.43" data-end="450.2">bit hard to tell but on the top of this</span> <span data-start="450.2" data-end="451.64">this light there's a little chimney and</span> <span data-start="451.64" data-end="453.35">that's the button for the light and what</span> <span data-start="453.35" data-end="454.73">you do is you give one of these lights</span> <span data-start="454.73" data-end="456.5">to one of your loved ones and when you</span> <span data-start="456.5" data-end="458.57">push the chim your chimney it doesn't</span> <span data-start="458.57" data-end="459.89">turn on your life but it actually turns</span> <span data-start="459.89" data-end="461.9">out in their light in their house and so</span> <span data-start="461.9" data-end="463.13">this is a way that you can tell somebody</span> <span data-start="463.13" data-end="465.08">over a distance that

is</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="473.6">this really cool it's taken something</span> <span data-start="473.6" data-end="475.43">it's very simple it has a real-world</span> <span data-start="475.43" data-end="478.1">user interface and it's made it better</span> <span data-start="478.1" data-end="480.59">with computing and I think this is the</span> <span data-start="480.59" data-end="482.72">kind of shape of what computing is going</span> <span data-start="482.72" data-end="484.13">to look like in the future where you</span> <span data-start="484.13"

data-end="491.3">and computing is completely behind the</span> <span data-start="491.3" data-end="492.95">scenes and just makes it happen the way</span> <span data-start="492.95" data-end="496.94">that you expect so you know as mentioned</span> <span data-start="496.94" data-end="500">in both of my intros I worked for a</span> <span data-start="500" data-end="502.1">company I
