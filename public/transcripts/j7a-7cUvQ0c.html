<p><span data-start="6.9" data-end="11.87">how's it going everybody</span> <span data-start="11.88" data-end="13.83">real quick plug for codes</span> <span data-start="13.83" data-end="15.36">they actually just hired somebody who</span> <span data-start="15.36" data-end="17.19">graduated from code Smith it was a</span> <span data-start="17.19" data-end="19.23">couple months ago it worked out great so</span> <span data-start="19.23" data-end="21.779">highly recommended yeah so today we're</span> <span data-start="21.779" data-end="23.16">going to talk about load testing which</span> <span data-start="23.16" data-end="24.689">is also known as denial of service</span> <span data-start="24.689" data-end="27.63">attacks so anytime somebody asks you hey</span> <span data-start="27.63" data-end="29.369">can you beta test my app you can say</span> <span data-start="29.369" data-end="31.65">yeah I actually can do more than that I</span> <span data-start="31.65" data-end="34.44">can help you destroy it so a little bit</span> <span data-start="34.44" data-end="37.199">about me my background in coding since</span> <span data-start="37.199" data-end="39.36">the original Gameboy and I've been doing</span> <span data-start="39.36" data-end="41.07">startups pretty much my whole working</span> <span data-start="41.07" data-end="42.989">life I actually met my first investor at</span> <span data-start="42.989" data-end="45.21">a racetrack we did 200 miles an hour</span> <span data-start="45.21" data-end="47.519">without helmets on so I know he was a</span> <span data-start="47.519" data-end="50.1">risk taker and so that was kind of a</span> <span data-start="50.1" data-end="52.29">good profile and we meshed and anyway</span> <span data-start="52.29" data-end="54.75">started a company so load testing of</span> <span data-start="54.75" data-end="57.57">course what is load testing Dave gave a</span> <span data-start="57.57" data-end="59.4">pretty good introduction to it but</span> <span data-start="59.4" data-end="61.08">basically it's about finding that limit</span> <span data-start="61.08" data-end="63.239">and then pushing past it and seeing what</span> <span data-start="63.239" data-end="66.39">happens so we try to simulate all kinds</span> <span data-start="66.39" data-end="68.28">of user activities some normal some</span> <span data-start="68.28" data-end="71.07">abnormal and apply stress on the</span> <span data-start="71.07" data-end="73.35">application or the REST API or whatever</span> <span data-start="73.35" data-end="76.14">it is until that moment at which it all</span> <span data-start="76.14" data-end="78.21">just comes crashing down and sometimes</span> <span data-start="78.21" data-end="80.01">it degrades nicely and smoothly that</span> <span data-start="80.01" data-end="82.11">never happens for me it always just sort</span> <span data-start="82.11" data-end="83.61">of flips a switch and then it just</span> <span data-start="83.61" data-end="84.93">absolute meltdown</span> <span data-start="84.93" data-end="86.91">sometimes it takes the database down</span> <span data-start="86.91" data-end="89.7">with it so all kinds of fun stuff with</span> <span data-start="89.7" data-end="92.16">load testing but we're definitely going</span> <span data-start="92.16" data-end="93.93">to we're definitely going to learn a</span> <span data-start="93.93" data-end="95.7">little bit more about how to use it I</span> <span data-start="95.7" data-end="98.85">guess effectively and how to use it in a</span> <span data-start="98.85" data-end="100.71">way that can actually help things move</span> <span data-start="100.71" data-end="102.09">forward instead of just taking them down</span> <span data-start="102.09" data-end="104.85">so in looking at what happens under load</span> <span data-start="104.85" data-end="106.05">you have a couple different things</span> <span data-start="106.05" data-end="109.02">depending on who you talk to talk to us</span> <span data-start="109.02" data-end="110.97">talk to the engineers the developers and</span> <span data-start="110.97" data-end="112.5">all of that then there are technical</span> <span data-start="112.5" data-end="114.03">limits you know does it does it crash</span> <span data-start="114.03" data-end="116.4">okay it crash well how quickly can it</span> <span data-start="116.4" data-end="118.5">come back up if you take down a database</span> <span data-start="118.5" data-end="120.3">under load it could take a second for it</span> <span data-start="120.3" data-end="124.08">to come back up for various reasons does</span> <span data-start="124.08" data-end="127.02">the experience of the app degrade nicely</span> <span data-start="127.02" data-end="129.239">or does it again just sort of melt down</span> <span data-start="129.239" data-end="131.129">does it start errors start popping up</span> <span data-start="131.129" data-end="133.64">pages start taking really long to load</span> <span data-start="133.64" data-end="136.2">depends on what it is rest api website</span> <span data-start="136.2" data-end="138.989">whatever or an app you know mobile app</span> <span data-start="138.989" data-end="140.67">but there are a lot of things that can</span> <span data-start="140.67" data-end="142.2">happen technically but then when you</span> <span data-start="142.2" data-end="144.47">look at and talk to the business guy</span> <span data-start="144.47" data-end="147.42">there are much more serious impacts</span> <span data-start="147.42" data-end="149.36">like you know what does how many</span> <span data-start="149.36" data-end="151.8">customers can we handle if we get more</span> <span data-start="151.8" data-end="154.92">customers than that and then the site</span> <span data-start="154.92" data-end="157.23">crashes do we lose the last half-hour of</span> <span data-start="157.23" data-end="159.84">orders which could you know be a lot of</span> <span data-start="159.84" data-end="161.819">money especially when you're handling a</span> <span data-start="161.819" data-end="164.76">large volume of users so for example if</span> <span data-start="164.76" data-end="166.17">something were to crash on Black Friday</span> <span data-start="166.17" data-end="168.6">and you lose oh let's say half a day of</span> <span data-start="168.6" data-end="170.4">orders that could be that could be a</span> <span data-start="170.4" data-end="172.26">quarter of the orders for the whole year</span> <span data-start="172.26" data-end="174.72">so obviously you need to make sure that</span> <span data-start="174.72" data-end="176.61">doesn't happen and then assuming that</span> <span data-start="176.61" data-end="178.319">you can figure out what happens how much</span> <span data-start="178.319" data-end="180.569">does it cost to actually fix it and</span> <span data-start="180.569" data-end="182.94">reinforce it and get it ready so some of</span> <span data-start="182.94" data-end="184.83">the goals that we're gonna focus on or</span> <span data-start="184.83" data-end="188.58">some of the I guess the intent of load</span> <span data-start="188.58" data-end="190.53">testing really is to gauge performance</span> <span data-start="190.53" data-end="193.59">to assess reliability to figure out</span> <span data-start="193.59" data-end="195.93">scalability whatever that means that can</span> <span data-start="195.93" data-end="197.069">mean a lot of different things to a lot</span> <span data-start="197.069" data-end="199.95">of different people and in some cases it</span> <span data-start="199.95" data-end="201.66">can mean capacity planning so figuring</span> <span data-start="201.66" data-end="203.61">out how to handle that volume how to</span> <span data-start="203.61" data-end="205.38">handle those spikes in traffic are we</span> <span data-start="205.38" data-end="208.23">prepared are we confident in our system</span> <span data-start="208.23" data-end="210.6">you know when we test a little bit on a</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="212.489">local machine does it already start to</span> <span data-start="212.489" data-end="214.5">exhibit strange behavior under load and</span> <span data-start="214.5" data-end="216.63">so you put it on a production system and</span> <span data-start="216.63" data-end="218.22">then it's just yeah it's just not going</span> <span data-start="218.22" data-end="220.53">to happen so some of the metrics some of</span> <span data-start="220.53" data-end="222.09">the magical numbers that we're going to</span> <span data-start="222.09" data-end="224.13">track with all of this latency that's a</span> <span data-start="224.13" data-end="226.5">big one and that's a good indicator as</span> <span data-start="226.5" data-end="228">you'll see in a graph a little bit later</span> <span data-start="228" data-end="230.489">on requests per second this is kind of</span> <span data-start="230.489" data-end="233.549">one of our magical numbers is how many</span> <span data-start="233.549" data-end="236.07">actual users simultaneously are really</span> <span data-start="236.07" data-end="238.56">requests simultaneously can we take now</span> <span data-start="238.56" data-end="240.06">it's possible for users to generate</span> <span data-start="240.06" data-end="242.1">multiple requests per second then that's</span> <span data-start="242.1" data-end="244.109">probably a problem in the app shouldn't</span> <span data-start="244.109" data-end="246.57">be doing that but response time how long</span> <span data-start="246.57" data-end="248.7">does it take when they hit a request to</span> <span data-start="248.7" data-end="250.68">the REST API tour whatever to the to the</span> <span data-start="250.68" data-end="252.209">website how long does it actually take</span> <span data-start="252.209" data-end="254.28">for a response to come back and again</span> <span data-start="254.28" data-end="256.019">you want to get that in a nice sweet</span> <span data-start="256.019" data-end="258.299">spot and when it starts to degrade</span> <span data-start="258.299" data-end="260.31">you're gonna see that response time just</span> <span data-start="260.31" data-end="262.41">slowly climbing up until it hits</span> <span data-start="262.41" data-end="265.32">infinity percentiles that's probably a</span> <span data-start="265.32" data-end="267.06">little bit more specific in terms of how</span> <span data-start="267.06" data-end="268.5">you actually look at these different</span> <span data-start="268.5" data-end="270.78">numbers now I wanted to throw out just</span> <span data-start="270.78" data-end="272.94">some ballpark numbers for requests per</span> <span data-start="272.94" data-end="275.039">second and latency now again everybody</span> <span data-start="275.039" data-end="276.45">is gonna have their own opinion about</span> <span data-start="276.45" data-end="278.97">what these numbers should be I would say</span> <span data-start="278.97" data-end="281.22">that for a mid-sized cloud instance</span> <span data-start="281.22" data-end="283.65">on Amazon like a medium or something you</span> <span data-start="283.65" data-end="285.12">should probably expect somewhere around</span> <span data-start="285.12" data-end="287.22">a thousand requests per second for</span> <span data-start="287.22" data-end="289.23">whatever it is and maybe 20 millisecond</span> <span data-start="289.23" data-end="292.17">latency 30 millisecond latency so when</span> <span data-start="292.17" data-end="293.73">you're doing all your load test you</span> <span data-start="293.73" data-end="295.14">start looking at the numbers and you're</span> <span data-start="295.14" data-end="297.24">not hitting that with the medium or</span> <span data-start="297.24" data-end="299.19">maybe a slightly above medium then you</span> <span data-start="299.19" data-end="302.4">should be concerned so we'll also take a</span> <span data-start="302.4" data-end="304.5">look at some product services</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.5" data-end="306.72">I should be getting paid by some of</span> <span data-start="306.72" data-end="307.92">these companies there's one in</span> <span data-start="307.92" data-end="309.15">particular although it's I guess an</span> <span data-start="309.15" data-end="311.97">open-source project so it's the one I</span> <span data-start="311.97" data-end="314.1">really like and I'm gonna show you how</span> <span data-start="314.1" data-end="315.72">to use it but here's some of the other</span> <span data-start="315.72" data-end="317.88">ones here's some of the paid ones which</span> <span data-start="317.88" data-end="319.71">has anybody used any of these by the way</span> <span data-start="319.71" data-end="321.86">quick show of hands okay a couple people</span> <span data-start="321.86" data-end="325.71">loader blitz so stuff so as to I don't</span> <span data-start="325.71" data-end="327.63">know Microsoft Microsoft's is actually</span> <span data-start="327.63" data-end="329.91">decent I hate to say it it's it's pretty</span> <span data-start="329.91" data-end="330.42">good</span> <span data-start="330.42" data-end="333.33">so flood I haven't used that one yet but</span> <span data-start="333.33" data-end="334.74">we tried a bunch of the others and we</span> <span data-start="334.74" data-end="336.65">had mixed experiences across the board</span> <span data-start="336.65" data-end="338.91">so we looked at some of the libraries</span> <span data-start="338.91" data-end="341.669">that were available Apache bench which</span> <span data-start="341.669" data-end="344.73">is kind of the I guess original</span> <span data-start="344.73" data-end="346.71">workhorse I mean everybody used to use</span> <span data-start="346.71" data-end="348.66">that back in the day for simulating</span> <span data-start="348.66" data-end="351.39">traffic and then artillery which is a</span> <span data-start="351.39" data-end="353.16">little bit more modern but a lot of the</span> <span data-start="353.16" data-end="355.44">same concept we really like artillery</span> <span data-start="355.44" data-end="356.64">that's what I'm going to get into on</span> <span data-start="356.64" data-end="358.53">this one and then W R K which I guess is</span> <span data-start="358.53" data-end="359.729">yet another flavor</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="398.34" data-end="401.31">I don't know sure they have some</span> <span data-start="401.31" data-end="403.95">dinosaur thing sure</span> <span data-start="403.95" data-end="406.05">so another thing that I would say that</span> <span data-start="406.05" data-end="408.27">he does not come with out of the box or</span> <span data-start="408.27" data-end="409.979">at least it didn't when when we were</span> <span data-start="409.979" data-end="413.039">testing and using it were like real time</span> <span data-start="413.039" data-end="413.63">monitor</span> <span data-start="413.63" data-end="416.3">of your app so looking from inside the</span> <span data-start="416.3" data-end="418.28">application or inside the API what's</span> <span data-start="418.28" data-end="420.8">going on I'm in crash reporting also so</span> <span data-start="420.8" data-end="422.9">figuring out if your thing does crash</span> <span data-start="422.9" data-end="425.48">and burn how did it crash was it you</span> <span data-start="425.48" data-end="427.55">know file system related network related</span> <span data-start="427.55" data-end="430.43">something else CPU a memory ran out of</span> <span data-start="430.43" data-end="432.8">memory which is a common one so figuring</span> <span data-start="432.8"

data-end="438.26">destroy it it's up to you to figure out</span> <span data-start="438.26" data-end="441.26">how it broke so fair warning about that</span> <span data-start="441.26" data-end="444.65">so this is probably the simplest test if</span> <span data-start="444.65" data-end="446.54">you mess with these numbers a little bit</span> <span data-start="446.54" data-end="448.01">you should be able to put a lot of</span> <span data-start="448.01" data-end="450.59">stress on whatever is at my app comm so</span> <span data-start="450.59" data-end="452.66">replace that with your friends app comm</span> <span data-start="452.66" data-end="455.03">and this specifically will put 10</span> <span data-start="455.03" data-end="457.94">virtual users every second making 20</span> <span data-start="457.94" data-end="460.58">requests each for about 60 seconds so</span> <span data-start="460.58" data-end="462.95">for

data-start="475.49" data-end="478.01">etc you can set up these scenarios where</span> <span data-start="478.01" data-end="480.59">you have sort of a scriptable behavior</span> <span

data-end="487.04">start to put in specific requests to</span> <span data-start="487.04" data-end="490.22">specific URLs you can also have it if</span> <span data-start="490.22"

a number of requests you can simulate</span> <span data-start="497.66" data-end="500.06">a little bit of people you know entering</span> <span data-start="500.06" data-end="501.71">pinging a few

sense logically when you think</span> <span data-start="542.78" data-end="544.31">about it I mean it's it's an application</span> <span data-start="544.31" data-end="546.74">it doesn't need to warm up

very</span> <span data-start="573.77" data-end="576.56">satisfying to just finish it off you</span> <span data-start="576.56" data-end="577.94">know you start it up and then you just</span> <span data-start="577.94" data-end="581.3">take it down so yeah in this particular</span> <span data-start="581.3" data-end="583.31">instance a couple of the numbers maybe</span> <span data-start="583.31" data-end="584.75">the ramp up period is a hundred users</span> <span data-start="584.75" data-end="587.54">every second cruising is maybe a hundred</span> <span data-start="587.54" data-end="589.58">users for a good twenty minutes and then</span> <span data-start="589.58" data-end="591.68">crash is like a thousand users for you</span> <span data-start="591.68" data-end="593.54">know for a minute straight and that'll</span> <span data-start="593.54" data-end="596.33">probably take it down so this is kind of</span> <span data-start="596.33" data-end="598.73">what happens when you run artillery you</span> <span data-start="598.73" data-end="600.05">know you put it in there you're putting</span> <span data-start="600.05"

data-end="605.209">it's outputting</span> <span data-start="605.209" data-end="608.45">so pretty not pretty there are many</span> <span data-start="608.45" data-end="610.37">different ways to report on what's going</span> <span data-start="610.37" data-end="612.77">on so we'll step through a little bit of</span> <span data-start="612.77" data-end="614.839">the terminology on this one and what</span> <span data-start="614.839" data-end="617.87">you're actually looking at but at the</span> <span data-start="617.87" data-end="619.76">end of the day you can generate charts</span> <span data-start="619.76" data-end="621.41">and stuff with it which we have one of</span> <span data-start="621.41" data-end="623.089">those coming up and those are actually</span> <span data-start="623.089" data-end="625.82">pretty the other this thing whatever but</span> <span data-start="625.82" data-end="628.279">anyway so scenarios launch scenarios</span> <span data-start="628.279" data-end="629.87">completed a number of requests for</span> <span data-start="629.87" data-end="632.81">second latency codes this is a really</span> <span data-start="632.81" data-end="635.18">important one so these are the HTTP</span> <span data-start="635.18" data-end="636.74">response codes let's say your load</span> <span data-start="636.74" data-end="639.17">testing a REST API and you're getting a</span> <span data-start="639.17" data-end="641.54">lot of 500 or 502 s or something like</span> <span data-start="641.54" data-end="643.13">that your web server is starting to act</span> <span data-start="643.13" data-end="644.66">a little funky maybe you're getting</span> <span data-start="644.66" data-end="646.1">timeouts</span> <span data-start="646.1" data-end="648.02">where does that 504 I don't does anybody</span> <span data-start="648.02" data-end="652.55">know it's VP codes in here 504 okay good</span> <span data-start="652.55" data-end="654.44">so if you're getting a lot of 504 is</span> <span data-start="654.44" data-end="656.48">then you're probably starting to reach</span> <span data-start="656.48" data-end="659.029">that limit so then you've got requests</span> <span data-start="659.029" data-end="660.74">completed if that's a good thing the</span> <span data-start="660.74" data-end="663.17">more you see of those the better so okay</span> <span data-start="663.17" data-end="665.39">let's look at it on a graph this is a</span> <span data-start="665.39" data-end="667.16">little bit more interesting and so what</span> <span data-start="667.16" data-end="668.75">we've got here is response time is in</span> <span data-start="668.75" data-end="670.64">green the green little boxes throughput</span> <span data-start="670.64" data-end="673.88">is blue so that's sort of what your what</span> <span data-start="673.88" data-end="674.81">you're handling and then you have</span> <span data-start="674.81" data-end="677.51">failures in red so if you look closely</span> <span data-start="677.51" data-end="680.19">at this and you look around 128 that's</span> <span data-start="680.19" data-end="682.05">meltdown it is finished it's over it's</span> <span data-start="682.05" data-end="684.42">not coming back up but if you look back</span> <span data-start="684.42" data-end="686.04">a little bit so you're almost looking at</span> <span data-start="686.04" data-end="687.96">this and then reversing time if you look</span> <span data-start="687.96" data-end="689.4">back a little bit you can actually see</span> <span data-start="689.4" data-end="690.75">that there are indicators that this is</span> <span data-start="690.75" data-end="694.08">about to happen so conceivably you could</span> <span data-start="694.08" data-end="696.06">add some sort of intelligence into your</span> <span data-start="696.06" data-end="697.47">application that when you start to</span> <span data-start="697.47" data-end="700.02">measure this kind of failure condition</span> <span data-start="700.02" data-end="702.12">you could either throw an alert you</span> <span data-start="702.12" data-end="704.07">could execute some other script you</span> <span data-start="704.07" data-end="706.53">could target an auto scaling piece of</span> <span data-start="706.53" data-end="708.33">logic or something like that you could</span> <span data-start="708.33" data-end="710.94">really start to react or preempt the</span> <span data-start="710.94" data-end="714.05">crash now that's perhaps a little bit</span> <span data-start="714.05" data-end="716.88">maybe it's not realistic in practicality</span> <span data-start="716.88" data-end="719.94">but it is certainly possible and so if</span> <span data-start="719.94" data-end="721.11">you add those hooks in there and you</span> <span data-start="721.11" data-end="722.79">have a little bit of awareness or</span> <span data-start="722.79" data-end="724.29">intelligence in the application you</span> <span data-start="724.29" data-end="725.4">might be able to prevent it from</span> <span data-start="725.4" data-end="728.25">crashing under load so if you look back</span> <span data-start="728.25" data-end="731.52">over under 32 so probably around what's</span> <span data-start="731.52" data-end="734.37">between 16 and 32 is where you start to</span> <span data-start="734.37" data-end="736.68">see B be latency and the response time</span> <span data-start="736.68" data-end="737.97">is climbing up a little bit you know</span> <span data-start="737.97" data-end="739.5">it's been pretty steady up until that</span> <span data-start="739.5" data-end="741.72">point but now you have your minimum</span> <span data-start="741.72" data-end="744.81">response time is starting to creep up so</span> <span data-start="744.81" data-end="746.61">and it never really recovers it never</span> <span data-start="746.61" data-end="748.86">really comes back down and then around</span> <span data-start="748.86" data-end="751.38">64 you start to get these 500 errors</span> <span data-start="751.38" data-end="753.63">whose HTTP errors and then of course</span> <span data-start="753.63" data-end="756.42">just crash and burn at 128 so this is a</span> <span data-start="756.42" data-end="758.9">good way of just looking at visually</span> <span data-start="758.9" data-end="761.91">what happens to an app as it hits load</span> <span data-start="761.91" data-end="765.69">or what happens to a REST API so this is</span> <span data-start="765.69" data-end="767.79">what your friends web logs will look</span>

data-start="774.57" data-end="779.1">certainly contentious but you have beta</span> <span data-start="779.1" data-end="781.11">testing periods that's probably when I</span> <span data-start="781.11" data-end="782.79">would recommend doing it maybe</span> <span data-start="782.79" data-end="785.1">pre-launch you do a heavy duty load test</span> <span data-start="785.1" data-end="786.72">you could
