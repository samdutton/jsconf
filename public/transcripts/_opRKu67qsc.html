<p><span data-start="125.34" data-end="129.88">WebKit is an web engine which is seen on</span> <span data-start="129.88" data-end="132.64">more and more smartphone platforms which</span> <span data-start="132.64" data-end="135.73">is really quite cool because there seems</span> <span data-start="135.73" data-end="139.09">to be some some joint venture going to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.09" data-end="142.16">WebKit where all the major windows are</span> <span data-start="142.16" data-end="147.08">too so our idea was to use web</span> <span data-start="147.08" data-end="153.68">technologies I like many people use them</span> <span data-start="153.68" data-end="157.55">as well together as html5 css3 and</span> <span data-start="157.55" data-end="161.12">JavaScript and build a unified</span> <span data-start="161.12" data-end="163.76">cross-platform environment to develop</span> <span data-start="163.76" data-end="167.72">applications so ideas to basically have</span> <span data-start="167.72" data-end="170.27">one code base which is deploy to</span> <span data-start="170.27" data-end="172.55">application stores like the itunes store</span> <span data-start="172.55" data-end="175.61">or to a typical web browser where you</span> <span data-start="175.61" data-end="177.38">can have a mobile web browser on a</span> <span data-start="177.38" data-end="180.29">smartphone or just a desktop web browser</span> <span data-start="180.29" data-end="182.96">or even have a widget on your desktop</span> <span data-start="182.96" data-end="185.18">using technologies like adobe air or</span> <span data-start="185.18" data-end="189.29">titanium or such things the benefits are</span> <span data-start="189.29" data-end="192.92">easy to list so basically we are talking</span> <span data-start="192.92" data-end="196.4">about reduced costs and we are a lot</span> <span data-start="196.4" data-end="199.1">faster so we basically improve our time</span> <span data-start="199.1" data-end="201.98">to market it's really marketing sling</span> <span data-start="201.98" data-end="206.42">here but okay yeah we have the right</span> <span data-start="206.42" data-end="208.58">platform support because web is</span> <span data-start="208.58" data-end="210.26">basically supported everywhere at the</span> <span data-start="210.26" data-end="214.84">moment and yes huge number of developers</span> <span data-start="214.84" data-end="217.94">at conferences like Jays convert seems</span> <span data-start="217.94" data-end="220.459">to even be increasing every year so it</span> <span data-start="220.459" data-end="223.07">seems to be really a new focus area at</span> <span data-start="223.07" data-end="225.14">the moment so and the technology is</span> <span data-start="225.14" data-end="229.37">quickly improving one goal which is</span> <span data-start="229.37" data-end="231.44">maybe different from other solutions we</span> <span data-start="231.44" data-end="233.63">have seen or might now already is that</span> <span data-start="233.63" data-end="237.83">our goal is to create real application</span> <span data-start="237.83" data-end="240.92">fear not just a better mobile website or</span> <span data-start="240.92" data-end="247.959">something like this so we really have a</span> <span data-start="247.959" data-end="252.43">zing which we try to solve is that we</span> <span data-start="252.43" data-end="255.62">have some kind of product manager at our</span> <span data-start="255.62" data-end="259.31">company which simply say yeah it's</span> <span data-start="259.31" data-end="261.169">pretty cool when you are more efficient</span> <span data-start="261.169" data-end="263.39">but it's not so cool if it looks not</span> <span data-start="263.39" data-end="268.09">like a native application so it will in</span> <span data-start="268.09" data-end="270.979">so really after this year to have the</span> <span data-start="270.979" data-end="273.26">same level of user experience on our</span> <span data-start="273.26" data-end="275.1">applications like on</span> <span data-start="275.1" data-end="278.22">native developed applications so this is</span> <span data-start="278.22" data-end="283.71">basically a quite challenging task one</span> <span data-start="283.71" data-end="286.41">thing for sure is that we might that we</span> <span data-start="286.41" data-end="292.14">make a massive use of JavaScript so we</span> <span data-start="292.14" data-end="294.03">created with interfaces and stuff</span> <span data-start="294.03" data-end="296.52">completely out of JavaScript directly on</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="300.57">the client to make this all possible we</span> <span data-start="300.57" data-end="303.17">basically have pretty strong</span> <span data-start="303.17" data-end="307.8">requirements thing is that this hardware</span> <span data-start="307.8" data-end="309.75">stuff is really improving year-over-year</span> <span data-start="309.75" data-end="312.51">so basically any moment it seems that</span> <span data-start="312.51" data-end="315.42">some of the stuff is only for as a top</span> <span data-start="315.42" data-end="317.79">notch of smartphones but in a year later</span> <span data-start="317.79" data-end="321.69">so on we really have a lot of devices</span> <span data-start="321.69" data-end="323.97">which are in the area to be supported by</span> <span data-start="323.97" data-end="327.08">this technology we are currently</span> <span data-start="327.08" data-end="329.1">regarding smartphones we are currently</span> <span data-start="329.1" data-end="332.58">only supporting touch screens yeah Wiz</span> <span data-start="332.58" data-end="337.47">do a three inch screen resolution and</span> <span data-start="337.47" data-end="339.45">here in something like this and we</span> <span data-start="339.45" data-end="343.05">really require a go to html5 and css3</span> <span data-start="343.05" data-end="346.14">support so oh it internet explorer's or</span> <span data-start="346.14" data-end="347.91">something like this it's really nothing</span> <span data-start="347.91" data-end="355.13">we can be care about this is ok because</span> <span data-start="355.13" data-end="358.95">the most applications we ask it for item</span> <span data-start="358.95" data-end="361.53">moment for iPhone and Android so this is</span> <span data-start="361.53" data-end="364.05">really the market most product managers</span> <span data-start="364.05" data-end="368.07">are looking at the moment so we are</span> <span data-start="368.07" data-end="371.1">increasing our platform support in next</span> <span data-start="371.1" data-end="374.82">month's but for the moment this is what</span> <span data-start="374.82" data-end="378.51">most product manager assets for so let's</span> <span data-start="378.51" data-end="382.63">give a small overview of the features</span> <span data-start="382.64" data-end="386.4">one thing is that we want to have a</span> <span data-start="386.4" data-end="388.95">professional workflow which basically</span> <span data-start="388.95" data-end="393.51">means that we want to bring JavaScript</span> <span data-start="393.51" data-end="395.99">some kind of professional development</span> <span data-start="395.99" data-end="398.88">style where you have fully</span> <span data-start="398.88" data-end="401.16">object-oriented to totally event-driven</span> <span data-start="401.16" data-end="403.89">all the stuff and you really can develop</span> <span data-start="403.89" data-end="405.6">your applications and your local browser</span> <span data-start="405.6" data-end="408.75">which is pretty efficient</span> <span data-start="408.75" data-end="412.14">compared to doing it on the smartphone</span> <span data-start="412.14" data-end="415.17">every time and have with the requirement</span> <span data-start="415.17" data-end="418.05">to push it to the simulators or</span> <span data-start="418.05" data-end="422.13">emulators every time we have built an</span> <span data-start="422.13" data-end="426.08">generic HTTP proxy witches used to</span> <span data-start="426.08" data-end="430.8">bridge the cross domain limitations for</span> <span data-start="430.8" data-end="432.87">some generic services like Twitter and</span> <span data-start="432.87" data-end="435.9">so on so we can basically talk to these</span> <span data-start="435.9" data-end="438.44">external services even if the</span> <span data-start="438.44" data-end="440.73">application runs on the local browser</span> <span data-start="440.73" data-end="444.48">which is quite limited sometimes and one</span> <span data-start="444.48" data-end="448.02">thing which it's really nice as well as</span> <span data-start="448.02" data-end="450.78">that we have worked on automating these</span> <span data-start="450.78" data-end="453.56">native rappers so basically you have</span> <span data-start="453.56" data-end="456.24">heard about phonegap already and they</span> <span data-start="456.24" data-end="459.45">created a built for gap com platform</span> <span data-start="459.45" data-end="462.96">where you can upload a zip file and just</span> <span data-start="462.96" data-end="466.71">build a phonegap na bit version of your</span> <span data-start="466.71" data-end="469.169">web application something like this was</span> <span data-start="469.169" data-end="471.99">our original ideas well we are not as</span> <span data-start="471.99" data-end="474.419">far as them at the moment I think I'm</span> <span data-start="474.419" data-end="478.95">not sure but we have at least some kind</span> <span data-start="478.95" data-end="481.229">of preparations for these native</span> <span data-start="481.229" data-end="483.72">applications so you basically write your</span> <span data-start="483.72" data-end="486.03">web app tested in safari on your own</span> <span data-start="486.03" data-end="489.39">machine and then just say generate me an</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.39" data-end="492.63">Xcode project out of it something like</span> <span data-start="492.63" data-end="499.29">this regarding the UI interface I said</span> <span data-start="499.29" data-end="505.28">that we have idea that we really need to</span> <span data-start="505.28" data-end="509.39">bring native feeling to the to the</span> <span data-start="509.39" data-end="514.44">smartphone so we don't try to be some</span> <span data-start="514.44" data-end="518.01">kind of better website so what we</span> <span data-start="518.01" data-end="520.53">basically have is that we in unify we've</span> <span data-start="520.53" data-end="523.5">created a lot of components or controls</span> <span data-start="523.5" data-end="526.41">which are optimized for smartphones and</span> <span data-start="526.41" data-end="529.44">touchscreen usage which perfectly try to</span> <span data-start="529.44" data-end="532.62">emulate the native stuff we found on</span> <span data-start="532.62" data-end="537.23">iphone and android and so on things like</span> <span data-start="537.23" data-end="540.79">animations and destroy view things</span> <span data-start="540.79" data-end="544.9">might have seen other where I on lips</span> <span data-start="544.9" data-end="548.74">like sprout car and Yui as well also</span> <span data-start="548.74" data-end="550.96">included and here full support for touch</span> <span data-start="550.96" data-end="558.4">events is just one thing as well one</span> <span data-start="558.4" data-end="559.96">thing we have also built in as a will</span> <span data-start="559.96" data-end="562.75">navigation stuff on most smartphones you</span> <span data-start="562.75" data-end="564.91">basically have a layered approach where</span> <span data-start="564.91" data-end="571.3">you a go deeper and navigate back then</span> <span data-start="571.3" data-end="574.39">so each time only one layer is visible</span> <span data-start="574.39" data-end="576.91">and you just drive down and up and</span> <span data-start="576.91" data-end="578.71">something like this this is completely</span> <span data-start="578.71" data-end="580.81">automated and you basically only right</span> <span data-start="580.81" data-end="585.01">links to other sub views the world</span> <span data-start="585.01" data-end="586.96">system makes use of the browser location</span> <span data-start="586.96" data-end="589">so basically all the stuff behind the</span> <span data-start="589" data-end="592.66">hash we have the will and irrigation</span> <span data-start="592.66" data-end="595.05">structure supported to behold in the</span> <span data-start="595.05" data-end="597.79">browser location so basically we can</span> <span data-start="597.79" data-end="603.16">store this will information in some kind</span> <span data-start="603.16" data-end="605.95">of local storage so at restarting the</span> <span data-start="605.95" data-end="608.47">application we basically just go to the</span> <span data-start="608.47" data-end="613.78">original location yeah one thing also</span> <span data-start="613.78" data-end="615.46">included is some kind of data handling</span> <span data-start="615.46" data-end="616.99">where you have some automated</span> <span data-start="616.99" data-end="619.3">client-side caching integrated</span> <span data-start="619.3" data-end="621.4">accelerator Jason converter oil stuff</span> <span data-start="621.4" data-end="623.71">which really improves a usability and</span> <span data-start="623.71" data-end="629.91">efficiency of the developer and we</span> <span data-start="629.91" data-end="631.99">unifies basically some kind of</span> <span data-start="631.99" data-end="634.21">integration project where we use a lot</span> <span data-start="634.21" data-end="638.23">of existing components so we thought</span> <span data-start="638.23" data-end="640.9">about that the application developer</span> <span data-start="640.9" data-end="643.03">basically should not need a lot about</span> <span data-start="643.03" data-end="646.9">the infrastructure needed to create the</span> <span data-start="646.9" data-end="649.36">native applications so basically there's</span> <span data-start="649.36" data-end="651.97">an Xcode project skeleton and an Android</span> <span data-start="651.97" data-end="654.25">project skeleton which you can basically</span> <span data-start="654.25" data-end="656.41">just use and create your own application</span> <span data-start="656.41" data-end="661.57">from there's also a lot of tooling</span> <span data-start="661.57" data-end="664.72">integrated so some kind of automatic</span> <span data-start="664.72" data-end="668.02">dependency detection and stuff and you</span> <span data-start="668.02" data-end="671.32">can really optimize for each platform so</span> <span data-start="671.32" data-end="674.35">and your final code for Android</span> <span data-start="674.35" data-end="676.81">basically has no information about</span> <span data-start="676.81" data-end="679.12">iphone stuff it's it's really compiled</span> <span data-start="679.12" data-end="683.56">out so there's the world code from other</span> <span data-start="683.56" data-end="685.39">platforms is completely removed in</span> <span data-start="685.39" data-end="690.07">removed in one of the distant of the</span> <span data-start="690.07" data-end="693.85">office of the target builds we have some</span> <span data-start="693.85" data-end="697.41">some pretty amazing CSS tooling built in</span> <span data-start="697.41" data-end="700.63">modular turns us later and here and you</span> <span data-start="700.63" data-end="703.51">really have application API viewers and</span> <span data-start="703.51" data-end="706.72">unit testing stuff also integrated so</span> <span data-start="706.72" data-end="709.59">basically you have the world stuff</span> <span data-start="709.59" data-end="714.1">offered by components we are using so</span> <span data-start="714.1" data-end="718.72">let's have a look at the foundation one</span> <span data-start="718.72" data-end="722.16">thing we headed SN requirement was that</span> <span data-start="722.16" data-end="725.26">all of my bosses said that we shouldn't</span> <span data-start="725.26" data-end="727.54">really start from scratch everywhere so</span> <span data-start="727.54" data-end="731.37">basically we looked out what we can use</span> <span data-start="731.37" data-end="735.04">and what makes sense for us so basically</span> <span data-start="735.04" data-end="736.78">at the moment we say cook stew is a</span> <span data-start="736.78" data-end="739.96">brilliant JavaScript framework for these</span> <span data-start="739.96" data-end="742.12">things like tooling and such stuff but</span> <span data-start="742.12" data-end="744.58">is a but at the moment it's quite</span> <span data-start="744.58" data-end="748.45">optimized for the desktop so there's not</span> <span data-start="748.45"

data-end="1185.969">are there any questions yep</span> <span data-start="1185.979" data-end="1212.23">yep</span> <span data-start="1212.24" data-end="1215.37">not really i'm singers at deutsche</span> <span data-start="1215.37" data-end="1219.48">telekom is a pretty huge company we</span> <span data-start="1219.48" data-end="1221.4">basically have a lot of separate</span> <span data-start="1221.4" data-end="1224.46">divisions there says one part which is</span> <span data-start="1224.46" data-end="1227.549">t-mobile which is also known in the US</span> <span data-start="1227.549" data-end="1230.76">and so on and they basically decide what</span> <span data-start="1230.76" data-end="1234.98">handset say bye or create contracts with</span> <span data-start="1234.98" data-end="1239.52">our stuff is basically from the App</span> <span data-start="1239.52" data-end="1241.86">interest so we have also a few portraits</span> <span data-start="1241.86" data-end="1249.21">which are key in Germany available so</span> <span data-start="1249.21" data-end="1251.97">like emo Scout or such things and these</span> <span data-start="1251.97" data-end="1255">are asking us for applications and this</span> <span data-start="1255" data-end="1257.01">is a completely different story so this</span> <span data-start="1257.01" data-end="1258.9">is not really involved with the handset</span> <span data-start="1258.9" data-end="1261.03">stuff so it's really a separate seeing</span> <span data-start="1261.03" data-end="1263.1">where we just look how to make</span> <span data-start="1263.1" data-end="1265.88">applications for the most prominent or</span> <span data-start="1265.88" data-end="1268.38">successful other platforms we already</span> <span data-start="1268.38" data-end="1272.039">own so it's it's not that connected to</span> <span data-start="1272.039" data-end="1277.62">each other</span> <span data-start="1277.63" data-end="1283.28">and no no no and we have some internal</span> <span data-start="1283.28" data-end="1287.27">software development and it's completely</span> <span data-start="1287.27" data-end="1293.89">a separate thing but it's closed for the</span> <span data-start="1293.89" data-end="1297.68">company only it's not available for</span> <span data-start="1297.68" data-end="1302.84">contracting and such things so yeah any</span> <span data-start="1302.84" data-end="1314.09">other questions</span> <span data-start="1314.1" data-end="1330.27">so</span> <span data-start="1330.28" data-end="1334.549">and since that it's a huge movement at</span> <span data-start="1334.549" data-end="1337.429">the moment so basically every framework</span> <span data-start="1337.429" data-end="1340.46">which is already existing like sentra</span> <span data-start="1340.46" data-end="1345.65">maybe this yes origins in X J's and some</span> <span data-start="1345.65" data-end="1348.47">some frameworks like sprout car also</span> <span data-start="1348.47" data-end="1350.51">support touch strings and cooks itself</span> <span data-start="1350.51" data-end="1355.16">also improves as well so I'm not sure</span> <span data-start="1355.16" data-end="1357.679">how this will evolve in the future and</span> <span data-start="1357.679" data-end="1362.659">there are some different EDL's for sure</span> <span data-start="1362.659" data-end="1365.6">so basically jQuery Mobile has really</span> <span data-start="1365.6" data-end="1368.84">the idea of supporting a broad range of</span> <span data-start="1368.84" data-end="1373.039">devices while unify basically only tries</span> <span data-start="1373.039" data-end="1375.47">to bring native look and feel to the</span> <span data-start="1375.47" data-end="1380.75">devices which have power to support this</span> <span data-start="1380.75" data-end="1383.99">so basically we are not trying to</span> <span data-start="1383.99" data-end="1388.19">support Sumi NSA s60 at the moment so</span> <span data-start="1388.19" data-end="1391.01">basically it's just not powerful enough</span> <span data-start="1391.01" data-end="1395.539">and we have communicated this internally</span> <span data-start="1395.539" data-end="1398.059">already so basically our ideas to really</span> <span data-start="1398.059" data-end="1400.88">bring native like applications to the</span> <span data-start="1400.88" data-end="1402.74">smartphones because this is what our</span> <span data-start="1402.74" data-end="1406.94">product managers asked for and this</span> <span data-start="1406.94" data-end="1408.62">might be different and some other</span> <span data-start="1408.62" data-end="1410.96">solutions out there and we really try to</span> <span data-start="1410.96" data-end="1413.48">have pixel perfect iphone style</span> <span data-start="1413.48" data-end="1415.429">applications nothing where something is</span> <span data-start="1415.429" data-end="1418.07">offset or something like this it should</span> <span data-start="1418.07" data-end="1420.65">really look like a native applications</span> <span data-start="1420.65" data-end="1422.51">and feels like a native application as</span> <span data-start="1422.51" data-end="1427.01">well</span> </p>
