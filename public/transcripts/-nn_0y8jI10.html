see like your</span> <span data-start="886.99" data-end="893.35">drawing on the map was kind of fun okay</span> <span data-start="893.35" data-end="894.97">sorry because I have no idea where my</span> <span data-start="894.97" data-end="903.18">next slide is okay upper platform</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="903.19" data-end="937.129">Oh No XC know yeah oh wait okay</span> <span data-start="937.139" data-end="942.699">yay so we have the gamepad API as well</span> <span data-start="942.699" data-end="945.639">so you can control your game with</span> <span data-start="945.639" data-end="948.819">gamepad so that's boring that's not</span> <span data-start="948.819" data-end="952.239">really something you want to do on the</span> <span data-start="952.239" data-end="954.639">browser because we have consoles for</span> <span data-start="954.639" data-end="958.719">that but if you write html5 game for the</span> <span data-start="958.719" data-end="961.269">oh yeah console for example you can run</span> <span data-start="961.269" data-end="968.049">it in you can you need to implement the</span> <span data-start="968.049" data-end="971.709">gamepad ap either and the API actually</span> <span data-start="971.709" data-end="973.689">like it'sit's though if you want to</span> <span data-start="973.689" data-end="979.539">teach your kids how not to create the</span> <span data-start="979.539" data-end="982.089">architecture of an API just show them</span> <span data-start="982.089" data-end="986.259">the w3c documents about the gamepad API</span> <span data-start="986.259" data-end="989.079">because it's like the worst API ever we</span> <span data-start="989.079" data-end="991.689">don't have events there but you need to</span> <span data-start="991.689" data-end="994.839">pull on every frame to huge array of</span> <span data-start="994.839" data-end="998.919">buttons and check if the button is 0 or</span> <span data-start="998.919" data-end="1006.239">1 that makes no sense at all yep so</span> <span data-start="1006.239" data-end="1011.189">which one is the next Oh tight I hate</span> <span data-start="1011.189" data-end="1017.579">this part just in case yeah okay so what</span> <span data-start="1017.579" data-end="1022.259">about getusermedia so there is this</span> <span data-start="1022.259" data-end="1026.389">thing in the browser called WebRTC and</span> <span data-start="1026.389" data-end="1030.839">part of WebRTC is get user so WebRTC was</span> <span data-start="1030.839" data-end="1033.289">created to create skype like</span> <span data-start="1033.289" data-end="1035.22">applications inside the browser's you</span> <span data-start="1035.22" data-end="1037.769">have peer to peer connection and part of</span> <span data-start="1037.769" data-end="1041.779">this API is the get user media it's</span> <span data-start="1041.779" data-end="1046.259">access to your video and audio of the</span> <span data-start="1046.259" data-end="1050.58">browser so how many of you seen my talk</span> <span data-start="1050.58" data-end="1055.259">from last year okay like five people</span> <span data-start="1055.259" data-end="1061.799">great so it will be fun so I create the</span> <span data-start="1061.799" data-end="1065.369">really simple example of how get user</span> <span data-start="1065.369" data-end="1068.8">media works so that's the video</span> <span data-start="1068.8" data-end="1072.67">part those are just the puzzles like you</span> <span data-start="1072.67" data-end="1074.98">just need to grab one and put grab one</span> <span data-start="1074.98" data-end="1078.73">and grab one and put in the proper place</span> <span data-start="1078.73" data-end="1082.09">if you don't know where to put it you</span> <span data-start="1082.09" data-end="1084.46">can cheat like okay my hand is in here</span> <span data-start="1084.46" data-end="1100.68">yeah yep hmmm</span> <span data-start="1100.69" data-end="1106.63">voila yeah so that's the simple example</span> <span data-start="1106.63" data-end="1109.33">of how video can I mean that's not</span> <span data-start="1109.33" data-end="1110.92">really useful example but you get the</span> <span data-start="1110.92" data-end="1118.42">idea right and so how we can that's the</span> <span data-start="1118.42" data-end="1124.46">hardest part of this level I hate it but</span> <span data-start="1124.47" data-end="1128.5">how we can okay it's nice that we can</span> <span data-start="1128.5" data-end="1133.66">access the the video but how we can</span> <span data-start="1133.66" data-end="1137.77">actually use it so my idea from last</span> <span data-start="1137.77" data-end="1139.36">year I had to talk about the face</span> <span data-start="1139.36" data-end="1145.48">recognition and I created simple example</span> <span data-start="1145.48" data-end="1147.7">of so first of all what happens in the</span> <span data-start="1147.7" data-end="1151.36">first step is just we draw the stream</span> <span data-start="1151.36" data-end="1153.88">from the camera on canvas and run the</span> <span data-start="1153.88" data-end="1156.1">face detection algorithm there and when</span> <span data-start="1156.1" data-end="1163.65">the face is detected we stop like yeah</span> <span data-start="1163.65" data-end="1168.04">that's the first step so the second one</span> <span data-start="1168.04" data-end="1171.79">was we have a texture of the 3d model</span> <span data-start="1171.79" data-end="1174.58">from the WebGL game and then when we</span> <span data-start="1174.58" data-end="1176.74">detect the face we put the face on the</span> <span data-start="1176.74" data-end="1178.72">texture in the place where the face</span> <span data-start="1178.72" data-end="1185.68">should be so in this yeah yeah so</span> <span data-start="1185.68" data-end="1188.26">now we have a texture with our own</span> <span data-start="1188.26" data-end="1191.17">character and the second day third step</span> <span data-start="1191.17" data-end="1198.97">of course is to put this face on the</span> <span data-start="1198.97" data-end="1203.95">real model and so the algorithm detects</span> <span data-start="1203.95" data-end="1206.95">where the eyes are and put them in the</span> <span data-start="1206.95" data-end="1209.59">glass into the glasses where the nose is</span> <span data-start="1209.59" data-end="1211.63">and mouth and things like that so we</span> <span data-start="1211.63" data-end="1214.24">have our own 3d model and we can use it</span> <span data-start="1214.24" data-end="1222.06">in games or whatever</span> <span data-start="1222.07" data-end="1226.16">so that was one of the use cases one of</span> <span data-start="1226.16" data-end="1233.3">the things where you can use the yeah so</span> <span data-start="1233.3" data-end="1235.22">but if we can find the face in the video</span> <span data-start="1235.22" data-end="1237.65">can we use our heads as game controllers</span> <span data-start="1237.65" data-end="1240.38">and I had an example last year and I</span> <span data-start="1240.38" data-end="1242.87">think it worked but this year I couldn't</span> <span data-start="1242.87" data-end="1246.89">make run I don't know why there is this</span> <span data-start="1246.89" data-end="1257.84">game hook called head punk oh yeah</span> <span data-start="1257.84" data-end="1265.28">that's this and I'm not yeah exactly it</span> <span data-start="1265.28" data-end="1268.67">doesn't really work but what happens</span> <span data-start="1268.67" data-end="1272.15">there is you play a punk game with your</span> <span data-start="1272.15" data-end="1276.82">head that's quite kind of stupid but</span> <span data-start="1276.82" data-end="1282.11">it's possible so why not and like the</span> <span data-start="1282.11" data-end="1285.89">project i started last year and I'm not</span> <span data-start="1285.89" data-end="1288.38">working on it anymore was quite</span> <span data-start="1288.38" data-end="1292.22">controversial so if we can detect our</span> <span data-start="1292.22" data-end="1295.25">own face on the video can we detect the</span> <span data-start="1295.25" data-end="1299.63">face of the animal and there is this</span> <span data-start="1299.63" data-end="1301.49">library called kitty door I showed it</span> <span data-start="1301.49" data-end="1304.72">last year that you just put the cat's</span> <span data-start="1304.72" data-end="1308.12">photo there and it starts looking for it</span> <span data-start="1308.12" data-end="1312.08">and voila so we created together with my</span> <span data-start="1312.08" data-end="1313.76">friend the prototype of a game that you</span> <span data-start="1313.76" data-end="1321.89">control of your cat but I mean it was</span> <span data-start="1321.89" data-end="1324.44">quite fun for us it wasn't as fun for</span> <span data-start="1324.44" data-end="1328.67">the cat because oh I will not say why</span> <span data-start="1328.67" data-end="1333.65">but anyway you need to trust yeah so</span> <span data-start="1333.65" data-end="1339.83">where's the next side there i mean the</span> <span data-start="1339.83" data-end="1344.18">the game wasn't really a playable there</span> <span data-start="1344.18" data-end="1349.67">is is it even a word anyway because the</span> <span data-start="1349.67" data-end="1351.44">algorithm is really slow so we need like</span> <span data-start="1351.44" data-end="1354.23">a second for a frame so</span> <span data-start="1354.23" data-end="1358.549">that's not really funny but getusermedia</span> <span data-start="1358.549" data-end="1361.39">it's not only the video as I said before</span> <span data-start="1361.39" data-end="1365.15">it's also and people usually forget</span> <span data-start="1365.15" data-end="1368.6">about it it's also about audio so you</span> <span data-start="1368.6" data-end="1371.39">can access your microphone as well not</span> <span data-start="1371.39" data-end="1375.679">only the camera and so is it possible to</span> <span data-start="1375.679" data-end="1377.69">write a game that you control with a</span> <span data-start="1377.69" data-end="1380.21">microphone I mean of course it is</span> <span data-start="1380.21" data-end="1383.27">everything is possible right but let's</span> <span data-start="1383.27" data-end="1393.71">try so first of all I need to whoa no no</span> <span data-start="1393.71" data-end="1403.69">no no</span> <span data-start="1403.7" data-end="1417.64">whoops sorry</span> <span data-start="1417.65" data-end="1422.6">okay so first of all I need to do a</span> <span data-start="1422.6" data-end="1425.9">little calibration so please be quiet</span> <span data-start="1425.9" data-end="1434.09">for a second okay ok and now on three</span> <span data-start="1434.09" data-end="1438.74">can you all shout like really loud one</span> <span data-start="1438.74" data-end="1449.48">two three okay so I stole one of the</span> <span data-start="1449.48" data-end="1455.78">open source games example of the impact</span> <span data-start="1455.78" data-end="1459.47">j/s engine and I wrote my own plugin</span> <span data-start="1459.47" data-end="1463.52">that that blocks the keyboard control</span> <span data-start="1463.52" data-end="1466.13">and the character is always running and</span> <span data-start="1466.13" data-end="1514.43">it jumps when you scream so let's try</span> <span data-start="1514.44" data-end="1530.2">okay enough you get the idea yeah so so</span> <span data-start="1530.2" data-end="1533.7">we have other web AP ice as well like FM</span> <span data-start="1533.7" data-end="1538.54">radio API battery API light sensor API</span> <span data-start="1538.54" data-end="1544.14">and can we do a game controlled by the</span> <span data-start="1544.14" data-end="1548.35">battery status actually we could we can</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1548.35" data-end="1555.97">I it's not really smart thing but there</span> <span data-start="1555.97" data-end="1558.13">was the guy like almost a hundred years</span> <span data-start="1558.13" data-end="1562.84">ago called Greg Mallory and he was the</span> <span data-start="1562.84" data-end="1570.16">first guy that probably attempt the peak</span> <span data-start="1570.16" data-end="1573.7">of Mount Everest but he died when he was</span> <span data-start="1573.7" data-end="1575.59">getting back or going there so we don't</span> <span data-start="1575.59" data-end="1577.9">know but like three years before he get</span> <span data-start="1577.9" data-end="1580.66">there someone asked him man why do you</span> <span data-start="1580.66" data-end="1583.33">want to do that and he was like because</span> <span data-start="1583.33" data-end="1589.21">it's there so I like of course we don't</span> <span data-start="1589.21" data-end="1591.4">need to use those AP is for our games</span> <span data-start="1591.4" data-end="1595.87">but they're there why not and I actually</span> <span data-start="1595.87" data-end="1599.14">don't have a demo I I'm it's a pity but</span> <span data-start="1599.14" data-end="1610.99">in Firefox OS in Firefox ok so in</span> </p>
