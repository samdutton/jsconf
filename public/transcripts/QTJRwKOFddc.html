data-start="215.78" data-end="219.68">neat little kernel bits of software one</span> <span data-start="219.68" data-end="221.93">of them is web dev that lets you lets</span> <span data-start="221.93" data-end="226.579">you do that I would sit here oh let me</span> <span data-start="226.579" data-end="230.269">see I'm gonna just reload this whole</span> <span data-start="230.269" data-end="233.09">page I'm sorry because that's some stuff</span> <span data-start="233.09" data-end="235.34">we were doing before in this environment</span> <span data-start="235.34" data-end="238.519">it's really just a web page but you've</span> <span data-start="238.519" data-end="240.5">got the basic graphics and added to that</span> <span data-start="240.5" data-end="242.87">is just a little bit of a little bit of</span> <span data-start="242.87" data-end="244.4">code that lets you pick things up and</span> <span data-start="244.4" data-end="248">move them around you can make copies of</span> <span data-start="248" data-end="250.609">things and then as I said there are</span> <span data-start="250.609" data-end="253.25">small little bits of little bits of</span> <span data-start="253.25" data-end="255.169">editors here so that for instance you</span> <span data-start="255.169" data-end="263.419">can change the shape of things and then</span> <span data-start="263.419" data-end="267.53">you can if you drag you can just drag</span> <span data-start="267.53" data-end="268.909">and drop things one on top of another</span> <span data-start="268.909" data-end="273.8">like this and then that becomes a new</span> <span data-start="273.8" data-end="276.62">object and you can in it inherits all</span> <span data-start="276.62" data-end="278.24">the same properties of objects so you</span> <span data-start="278.24" data-end="281.99">can you can make copies and and</span> <span data-start="281.99" data-end="287.69">similarly you get the same they behave</span> <span data-start="287.69" data-end="289.46">they inherit all the other graphics</span> <span data-start="289.46" data-end="291.68">properties that are available and you</span> <span data-start="291.68" data-end="294.139">can there other shapes been added like</span> <span data-start="294.139" data-end="296.75">polygons and stuff and and there's also</span> <span data-start="296.75" data-end="298.07">a</span> <span data-start="298.07" data-end="300.26">a green thread scheduler that lets you</span> <span data-start="300.26" data-end="304.43">do dynamic behavior so for instance well</span> <span data-start="304.43" data-end="305.93">he was here's a polygon that you can</span> <span data-start="305.93" data-end="308.66">pick up and move around and if I take</span> <span data-start="308.66" data-end="312.17">this and this little halo is our user</span> <span data-start="312.17" data-end="317">interface tit that helps to it helps to</span> <span data-start="317" data-end="318.89">deal with the problem which you'll</span> <span data-start="318.89" data-end="320.75">encounter if you try to do a system like</span> <span data-start="320.75" data-end="322.94">this of both having developer support</span> <span data-start="322.94" data-end="326.24">and user support in there so that's a</span> <span data-start="326.24" data-end="328.43">way of bringing up our commands so</span> <span data-start="328.43" data-end="329.75">there's a little inspector lets you</span> <span data-start="329.75" data-end="331.55">inspect the properties of that polygon</span> <span data-start="331.55" data-end="333.74">and you can also write code in it so I</span> <span data-start="333.74" data-end="342.17">could say this start stepping every 50</span> <span data-start="342.17" data-end="351.02">milliseconds the rotate by method with a</span> <span data-start="351.02" data-end="358.22">parameter of 0.05 or something like that</span> <span data-start="358.22" data-end="364.01">and okay so now we've got a now we've</span> <span data-start="364.01" data-end="367.73">got a spinning star and you can pick</span> <span data-start="367.73" data-end="369.26">that up and move it around while it's</span> <span data-start="369.26" data-end="372.62">live you can make copies of it so you</span> <span data-start="372.62" data-end="375.08">can have a lot of fun with this stuff so</span> <span data-start="375.08" data-end="377.5">for instance I could take this and</span> <span data-start="377.5" data-end="383.87">reshape it that way and pick this guy up</span> <span data-start="383.87" data-end="386.57">and drop him on there so now I've got a</span> <span data-start="386.57" data-end="389.12">little sort of magic wand thing and I</span> <span data-start="389.12" data-end="395.579">can stick that on there you know</span> <span data-start="395.589" data-end="399.319">so so this is how it should be right we</span> <span data-start="399.319" data-end="404.37">shouldn't be surprised I mean</span> <span data-start="404.38" data-end="407.35">poor mathematicians you know for</span> <span data-start="407.35" data-end="410.65">centuries had to deal with with looking</span> <span data-start="410.65" data-end="413.44">at the outside world and abstracting it</span> <span data-start="413.44" data-end="415.12">and coming up with cool little theories</span> <span data-start="415.12" data-end="417.04">now we can write cool little programs</span> <span data-start="417.04" data-end="419.17">and they go out in world and make these</span> <span data-start="419.17" data-end="421.54">neat graphic things and music and all</span> <span data-start="421.54" data-end="423.75">that good stuff</span> <span data-start="423.75" data-end="428.95">okay so just moving right along if you</span> <span data-start="428.95" data-end="430.81">take those shapes and just add you know</span> <span data-start="430.81" data-end="432.25">a little bit more script you can build</span> <span data-start="432.25" data-end="433.93">up widgets in ways that you all know</span> <span data-start="433.93" data-end="437.17">well and I'll just show you a little bit</span> <span data-start="437.17" data-end="442.81">about this so in this environment I mean</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.81" data-end="445.69">I've got a clock that's built here make</span> <span data-start="445.69" data-end="448.72">it a little bit bigger and in addition</span> <span data-start="448.72" data-end="451.72">to an inspector you can also get a sort</span> <span data-start="451.72" data-end="454.54">of a more powerful interface on it and</span> <span data-start="454.54" data-end="457.32">so that's our module system loading in</span> <span data-start="457.32" data-end="462.01">something else so here we've got a</span> <span data-start="462.01" data-end="465.79">scripting browser looking at the clock</span> <span data-start="465.79" data-end="468.22">and you see here are the names of the</span> <span data-start="468.22" data-end="470.98">methods and every every object when you</span> <span data-start="470.98" data-end="473.02">drop it in this world gets sent the</span> <span data-start="473.02" data-end="474.76">message start stepping scripts that's</span> <span data-start="474.76" data-end="477.1">what I did to the ellipse to the that</span> <span data-start="477.1" data-end="482.23">star and and if you take a look at this</span> <span data-start="482.23" data-end="484.27">one it says start stepping every</span> <span data-start="484.27" data-end="485.95">thousand milliseconds to set hands</span> <span data-start="485.95" data-end="487.57">procedure so that must be how the clock</span> <span data-start="487.57" data-end="490.75">works so I can go and click on set hands</span> <span data-start="490.75" data-end="493.72">and yes indeed it gets the data object</span> <span data-start="493.72" data-end="496.39">and pulls out the second the minute in</span> <span data-start="496.39" data-end="499.06">the hour into variables and then sets</span> <span data-start="499.06" data-end="501.16">the rotation of the three polygons that</span> <span data-start="501.16" data-end="503.8">are the three hands here it's setting</span> <span data-start="503.8" data-end="505.84">the second hands rotation to be the</span> <span data-start="505.84" data-end="508.3">current second divided by sixty times</span> <span data-start="508.3" data-end="510.3">two pi so that make sense</span> <span data-start="510.3" data-end="513.219">but since the system's live I can go</span> <span data-start="513.219" data-end="518.169">here and type a minus here and and</span> <span data-start="518.169" data-end="520.69">accept that now we've got a clock that</span> <span data-start="520.69" data-end="523.93">runs backwards and and that's not to say</span> <span data-start="523.93" data-end="526.81">that a backwards clock is a useful thing</span> <span data-start="526.81" data-end="529.21">but by just to show you sort of how it's</span> <span data-start="529.21" data-end="530.74">all immediate and in the environment</span> <span data-start="530.74" data-end="535.75">itself so let's see and one of the cool</span> <span data-start="535.75" data-end="536.329">things about</span> <span data-start="536.329" data-end="539.449">this is if you build things this way you</span> <span data-start="539.449" data-end="544.439">know everything runs just fine transform</span> <span data-start="544.449" data-end="546.709">again people are laughing that's the way</span> <span data-start="546.709" data-end="548.839">it should be right and and you know all</span> <span data-start="548.839" data-end="550.67">the text selection still works and in</span> <span data-start="550.67" data-end="554.269">fact we can even go in here and fix the</span> <span data-start="554.269" data-end="557.36">bug we put in there and now we've got a</span> <span data-start="557.36" data-end="569.869">normal clock again okay so this is so so</span> <span data-start="569.869" data-end="571.999">this is a neat environment but it's it's</span> <span data-start="571.999" data-end="574.459">it's for people like you and me and not</span> <span data-start="574.459" data-end="576.319">for the rest of the world it's basically</span> <span data-start="576.319" data-end="578.54">a programming environment and so we</span> <span data-start="578.54" data-end="581.059">wanted to widen the community that could</span> <span data-start="581.059" data-end="583.009">work with this kind of stuff and I hope</span> <span data-start="583.009" data-end="585.769">to show you some apps that that can be</span> <span data-start="585.769" data-end="589.369">built easily and and some others that</span> <span data-start="589.369" data-end="593.48">are real programming but we figured that</span> <span data-start="593.48" data-end="595.549">a Java Script ID wasn't necessarily the</span> <span data-start="595.549" data-end="597.29">answer for end users what's something</span> <span data-start="597.29" data-end="599.269">that's sort of more concrete where you</span> <span data-start="599.269" data-end="600.98">can pull things together and drag and</span> <span data-start="600.98" data-end="604.549">drop them that kind of stuff and so I'm</span> <span data-start="604.549" data-end="606.079">going to show you that environment in</span> <span data-start="606.079" data-end="607.61">just a minute but what I'm going to do</span> <span data-start="607.61" data-end="613.16">is it's first escape out of this just so</span> <span data-start="613.16" data-end="615.319">that you get this it's kind of a cool</span> <span data-start="615.319" data-end="619.309">aspect to all of this so if you look</span> <span data-start="619.309"
