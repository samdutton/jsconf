data-end="118.75">then suggest a few maybe improvements</span> <span data-start="118.75" data-end="120.34">that that we could implement in the</span> <span data-start="120.34" data-end="124.09">future so the first ones when the</span> <span data-start="124.09" data-end="126.1">organization it's setting up your</span> <span data-start="126.1" data-end="128.649">workspace and one of you start like</span> <span data-start="128.649" data-end="130.36">whenever I start working on a project</span> <span data-start="130.36" data-end="132.37">you open up your text editor can maybe</span> <span data-start="132.37" data-end="134.38">open a couple of terminal tabs you put</span> <span data-start="134.38" data-end="135.82">your browser over to the right or maybe</span> <span data-start="135.82" data-end="138.13">to the left and then you called away and</span> <span data-start="138.13" data-end="142.17">then that's all good you close it down</span> <span data-start="142.17" data-end="145.75">and you've wasted all this time setting</span> <span data-start="145.75" data-end="148.39">it all up you've got to move you're</span> <span data-start="148.39" data-end="149.5">going to nudge the windows about you can</span> <span data-start="149.5" data-end="150.549">take your hand off the keyboard you've</span> <span data-start="150.549" data-end="152.11">got to move the mouse and it's all about</span> <span data-start="152.11" data-end="157.329">it's a little bit frustrating so why not</span> <span data-start="157.329" data-end="159.22">treat the desktop is a malleable space</span> <span data-start="159.22" data-end="161.29">just right rather than thinking about</span> <span data-start="161.29" data-end="163.06">booting windows on the desktop consider</span> <span data-start="163.06" data-end="165.099">the desktop as being a space that you</span> <span data-start="165.099" data-end="166.93">can you can bend to your well so we can</span> <span data-start="166.93" data-end="168.67">actually take a knife through it and we</span> <span data-start="168.67" data-end="171.129">split it in half split it again you</span> <span data-start="171.129" data-end="173.29">split it again even if you want to go</span> <span data-start="173.29" data-end="174.819">all the way through you can just split</span> <span data-start="174.819" data-end="176.65">up the whole thing and then the whole</span> <span data-start="176.65" data-end="178.359">thing can be resized and each window</span> <span data-start="178.359" data-end="180.609">you've created can be going to resize</span> <span data-start="180.609" data-end="183.459">them dependently and then you can summon</span> <span data-start="183.459" data-end="187.48">your your tasks and to here to get to</span> <span data-start="187.48" data-end="194.99">get your job done so that's one thing</span> <span data-start="195" data-end="198.25">bigger applications we used bigger</span> <span data-start="198.25" data-end="200.709">applications every day you've got web</span> <span data-start="200.709" data-end="202.889">browser as we get Photoshop we get emacs</span> <span data-start="202.889" data-end="205.419">all these applications that do tons of</span> <span data-start="205.419" data-end="207.28">stuff and very often you just want to do</span> <span data-start="207.28" data-end="209.319">one little thing and you think I'd be</span> <span data-start="209.319" data-end="210.519">great if I could just take that one</span> <span data-start="210.519" data-end="212.319">little piece of functionality from this</span> <span data-start="212.319" data-end="216.569">application and use it use it by itself</span> <span data-start="216.569" data-end="218.799">so let's try implementing something like</span> <span data-start="218.799" data-end="225.189">that let's make maybe a text editor so</span> <span data-start="225.189" data-end="230.139">we'll split the work space here we got a</span> <span data-start="230.139" data-end="233.709">text editor component and we can have a</span> <span data-start="233.709" data-end="236.44">command bar and I'm going the two</span> <span data-start="236.44" data-end="239.53">together so rather than having a single</span> <span data-start="239.53" data-end="243.159">application we have small chunks of a</span> <span data-start="243.159" data-end="246.579">functionality that can tail blocks what</span> <span data-start="246.579" data-end="248.76">to do I can't clean a visual programming</span> <span data-start="248.76" data-end="251.919">now I'm unprepared and I haven't got a</span> <span data-start="251.919" data-end="270.01">fail to play about with here so</span> <span data-start="270.02" data-end="272.12">so there we go we've we've hooked it up</span> <span data-start="272.12" data-end="274.009">and know we've taught there the</span> <span data-start="274.009" data-end="275.3">application how to how to load the</span> <span data-start="275.3" data-end="278.03">contents of a fail and what what have</span> <span data-start="278.03" data-end="280.28">you wanted a like a buff a list of your</span> <span data-start="280.28" data-end="282.229">open files of your if you're working on</span> <span data-start="282.229" data-end="283.639">a bigger project again what we do is we</span> <span data-start="283.639" data-end="286.729">just split the space and will say well</span> <span data-start="286.729" data-end="289.61">let's have some history in here and</span> <span data-start="289.61" data-end="291.74">we'll connect make the relevant</span> <span data-start="291.74" data-end="293.509">connections I know next thing we open a</span> <span data-start="293.509" data-end="297.28">file they as itself to the list and</span> <span data-start="297.28" data-end="299.419">double-clicking it again a double</span> <span data-start="299.419" data-end="303.8">clicking it should reopen it if you hook</span> <span data-start="303.8" data-end="308.479">it up correctly so there's another</span> <span data-start="308.479" data-end="310.34">another example and we can we can do so</span> <span data-start="310.34" data-end="311.599">we can do something similar if we could</span> <span data-start="311.599" data-end="313.759">we could we could replace the text</span> <span data-start="313.759" data-end="321.38">editor where the browser component hook</span> <span data-start="321.38" data-end="326.87">the two together and dad want a wife I</span> <span data-start="326.87" data-end="328.52">hope you can trust me that I actually</span> <span data-start="328.52" data-end="337.84">works um so that's an ass another um</span> <span data-start="337.84" data-end="339.949">frustration I have a desktop to the fact</span> <span data-start="339.949" data-end="343.909">we can't completely compose chunks of</span> <span data-start="343.909" data-end="345.529">functionality as you would do maybe on</span> <span data-start="345.529" data-end="347.75">the console or in the terminal if they</span> <span data-start="347.75" data-end="349.87">easy to create pipelines whereas</span> <span data-start="349.87" data-end="351.889">traditionally in a graphical environment</span> <span data-start="351.889" data-end="357.139">you're stuck with what you've got makes</span> <span data-start="357.139" data-end="362.93">frustration recall so it kind of ties in</span> <span data-start="362.93" data-end="365.09">with the first point of a building up</span> <span data-start="365.09" data-end="368.12">your workspace but it seems two strikes</span> <span data-start="368.12" data-end="370.61">me is absolutely ludicrous a nest in age</span> <span data-start="370.61" data-end="372.349">that once we've set up a workspace</span> <span data-start="372.349" data-end="373.789">there's no way of just saying give me</span> <span data-start="373.789" data-end="375.8">that
