basically what I've</span> <span data-start="35.489" data-end="38.34">been thinking about a lot is how do we</span> <span data-start="38.34" data-end="44.879">use computers to aid us in sort of</span>

<span data-start="72" data-end="74.58">sort of interested in like what do</span> <span data-start="74.58" data-end="76.5">slides look like when we're talking</span> <span data-start="76.5"
