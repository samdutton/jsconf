data-start="23.06" data-end="25.13">Erin Heckman i work at learn boost we're</span> <span data-start="25.13" data-end="28.4">building the next generation education</span> <span data-start="28.4"

going</span> <span data-start="43.61" data-end="44.93">to talk about any of our open source</span> <span data-start="44.93" data-end="47.3">stuff today pretty much i want to just</span> <span data-start="47.3" data-end="49.07">share some things are doing internally</span> <span data-start="49.07" data-end="52.79">that that are pretty cool in my opinion</span> <span data-start="52.79" data-end="56.39">so why do i say products are better than</span> <span data-start="56.39" data-end="58.94">code we're at this tech conference what</span> <span data-start="58.94" data-end="62.18">we're really like you know in deep to</span> <span data-start="62.18" data-end="64.28">like these greatest techniques and how</span> <span data-start="64.28" data-end="66.26">to do things really awesome is software</span> <span data-start="66.26" data-end="68.479">craftsman but i think it's important to</span> <span data-start="68.479" data-end="72.38">remember who that end user is and it may</span> <span data-start="72.38" data-end="75.35">be some of our cases they are developers</span> <span data-start="75.35" data-end="79.28">but in learn boost case it's it's a</span> <span data-start="79.28" data-end="81.98">typical you know user who knows how to</span> <span data-start="81.98" data-end="85.39">use a computer or a mobile device and</span> <span data-start="85.39" data-end="88.22">they're not they don't really care too</span> <span data-start="88.22" data-end="90.14">much about that i mean we could we could</span> <span data-start="90.14" data-end="93.98">spend a lot of time building a mountain</span> <span data-start="93.98" data-end="97.67">of amazing super efficient coolest you</span> <span data-start="97.67" data-end="101.18">know techniques software but our users</span> <span data-start="101.18" data-end="103.52">don't really care so much about how it's</span> <span data-start="103.52" data-end="105.38">made they just want to know that it</span> <span data-start="105.38" data-end="108.5">works and in this example of a ugly</span> <span data-start="108.5" data-end="111.47">antenna spitting out numbers these users</span> <span data-start="111.47" data-end="113.15">probably just care about something like</span> <span data-start="113.15" data-end="116.18">a wall of boom boxes blasting fresh cuts</span> <span data-start="116.18" data-end="117.29">so they can have an awesome break</span> <span data-start="117.29" data-end="120.799">dancing party I mean the product is the</span> <span data-start="120.799" data-end="123.049">boom box in this case and you know they</span> <span data-start="123.049" data-end="125.57">just they just want their life to be</span> <span data-start="125.57" data-end="129.409">improved in some way shape or form so at</span> <span data-start="129.409" data-end="130.94">learn posts were we're four and a half</span> <span data-start="130.94" data-end="135.28">developers were pretty small and</span> <span data-start="135.28" data-end="137.9">building our infrastructure on top of</span> <span data-start="137.9" data-end="140.72">node J s means we've had to write a lot</span> <span data-start="140.72" data-end="143.78">of things ourselves and so we kind of</span> <span data-start="143.78" data-end="145.01">need to be careful about where we're</span> <span data-start="145.01" data-end="148.43">spending our time because we really want</span> <span data-start="148.43" data-end="150.21">to stay focused on the product but yet</span> <span data-start="150.21" data-end="152.31">work on the projects that we're really</span> <span data-start="152.31" data-end="155.64">interested in and or that just need to</span> <span data-start="155.64" data-end="157.83">be done because there's you know no</span> <span data-start="157.83" data-end="160.08">module to do whatever it is we're trying</span> <span data-start="160.08" data-end="162.48">to do so we want to be more like neo and</span> <span data-start="162.48" data-end="163.59">we want to fly at a million miles an</span> <span data-start="163.59" data-end="167.97">hour but how do we do that in in general</span> <span data-start="167.97" data-end="172.23">and I'm going to cover a few ways that</span> <span data-start="172.23" data-end="175.71">we do that and it primarily the way we</span> <span data-start="175.71" data-end="179.74">save time is by not writing any code</span> <span data-start="179.75" data-end="183.87">yeah so the first way we don't write</span> <span data-start="183.87" data-end="186.03">code at learn boost is by not writing</span> <span data-start="186.03" data-end="188.97">any Ajax and I'm not saying we don't use</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="188.97" data-end="191.25">Ajax because we use it everywhere like</span> <span data-start="191.25" data-end="195.72">an every page a lot but for ninety-nine</span> <span data-start="195.72" data-end="198.48">percent of our use cases we don't write</span> <span data-start="198.48" data-end="201.2">it anymore it's all just abstracted out</span> <span data-start="201.2" data-end="204.69">so we can save time and I mean I</span> <span data-start="204.69" data-end="207.45">personally believe that if you're</span> <span data-start="207.45" data-end="209.1">writing Ajax today you're probably doing</span> <span data-start="209.1" data-end="211.41">it wrong because you don't really have</span> <span data-start="211.41" data-end="212.94">to and I'm going to kind of go into some</span> <span data-start="212.94" data-end="215.82">detail we use something we'd like to</span> <span data-start="215.82" data-end="219.3">call data dynamic to to take care of</span> <span data-start="219.3" data-end="221.76">this for us and it's really just a fancy</span> <span data-start="221.76" data-end="224.25">name for a lot of jQuery event</span> <span data-start="224.25" data-end="228.63">delegation and part two is a managed</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.63" data-end="233.31">JSON response from the server so as far</span> <span data-start="233.31" data-end="237.21">as event delegation goes will take like</span> <span data-start="237.21" data-end="239.07">a traditional form and we throw this</span> <span data-start="239.07" data-end="242.1">data dynamic attribute on it and so our</span> <span data-start="242.1" data-end="246.09">event delegator picks up on that and</span> <span data-start="246.09" data-end="247.38">it's smart enough to just serialize the</span> <span data-start="247.38" data-end="249.27">form and send it back to the server</span> <span data-start="249.27" data-end="251.31">that's pretty standard but it's also</span> <span data-start="251.31" data-end="253.02">smart enough to know if the jQuery</span> <span data-start="253.02" data-end="255.15">validator fails you know how to display</span> <span data-start="255.15" data-end="256.83">those messages and and not submit</span> <span data-start="256.83" data-end="258.69">anything so that's nothing really</span> <span data-start="258.69" data-end="262.23">mind-blowing or whatever but it doesn't</span> <span data-start="262.23" data-end="264.81">have to be a form it can be any element</span> <span data-start="264.81" data-end="267.09">on our page that we feel like putting</span> <span data-start="267.09" data-end="269.16">this on and we just point that attribute</span> <span data-start="269.16" data-end="271.86">at a route that we want to hit and so in</span> <span data-start="271.86" data-end="274.26">this case our anything route is just</span> <span data-start="274.26" data-end="276.54">going to go or anything element when you</span> <span data-start="276.54" data-end="278.04">click on it it's going to hit that wagon</span> <span data-start="278.04" data-end="280.35">route and you're not limited to a get</span> <span data-start="280.35" data-end="281.1">request which</span> <span data-start="281.1" data-end="284.04">this this use case would be but you can</span> <span data-start="284.04" data-end="285.84">change that you can put a method</span> <span data-start="285.84" data-end="288.66">actually beat on any element and you</span> <span data-start="288.66" data-end="290.01">know change it to a post and then we'll</span> <span data-start="290.01" data-end="292.61">have our cross site request forgery</span> <span data-start="292.61" data-end="295.73">protection like in place and all that</span> <span data-start="295.73" data-end="298.91">another really common use case for us</span> <span data-start="298.91" data-end="301.26">our dialogues we've used a ton of</span> <span data-start="301.26" data-end="305.58">dialogues and so we can just throw a</span> <span data-start="305.58" data-end="307.62">data pop up remote on there and that is</span> <span data-start="307.62" data-end="309.9">what it sounds like we want to grab the</span> <span data-start="309.9" data-end="312.66">content for the dialogue from a remote</span> <span data-start="312.66" data-end="316.23">location so you know this would delegate</span> <span data-start="316.23" data-end="318.48">off to the Oregon Trail route and then</span> <span data-start="318.48" data-end="321.63">populated a dialogue with the response</span> <span data-start="321.63" data-end="325.53">and similarly we do a lot of tooltips so</span> <span data-start="325.53" data-end="327.39">tooltips work the same way just throw</span> <span data-start="327.39" data-end="328.62">this at should be down there forget</span> <span data-start="328.62" data-end="330.63">about it so we're not writing anything</span> <span data-start="330.63" data-end="332.43">client-side anymore it's all delegated</span> <span data-start="332.43" data-end="336.78">as far as setting up the requests go so</span> <span data-start="336.78" data-end="338.37">the second part of that is that response</span> <span data-start="338.37" data-end="340.31">which we don't want to write either</span> <span data-start="340.31" data-end="343.55">because we're really lazy in a good way</span> <span data-start="343.55" data-end="346.86">and so this this kind of just shows</span> <span data-start="346.86" data-end="349.26">several the options that we have we're</span> <span data-start="349.26" data-end="354.45">using Express so here with Express you</span> <span data-start="354.45" data-end="356.34">can throw a buffer or an object or raise</span> <span data-start="356.34" data-end="358.65">or whatever down into response that sent</span> <span data-start="358.65" data-end="360.29">and it will see realize them for you</span> <span data-start="360.29" data-end="363.03">into JSON and send that string down with</span> <span data-start="363.03" data-end="366">a client but like these are the common</span> <span data-start="366" data-end="367.92">use cases we have and so once we're on</span> <span data-start="367.92" data-end="371.45">the server and we do what we need to do</span> <span data-start="371.45" data-end="373.86">we can tell the client whatever it is</span> <span data-start="373.86" data-end="375.39">that we feel like telling the client to</span> <span data-start="375.39" data-end="379.05">do so we can replace elements we can</span> <span data-start="379.05" data-end="381.36">omit events on either our global learn</span> <span data-start="381.36" data-end="384.21">boost object or trigger events</span> <span data-start="384.21" data-end="386.79">specifically on whatever elements we</span> <span data-start="386.79" data-end="388.65">want to impasse in whatever args we want</span> <span data-start="388.65" data-end="391.35">to pop up as the same thing as that data</span> <span data-start="391.35" data-end="393.38">pop up remote that I was talking about</span> <span data-start="393.38" data-end="396.66">so we don't need to you know ever get</span> <span data-start="396.66" data-end="403.219">dirty with that redirects success</span> <span data-start="403.229" data-end="406.21">validation failures it's all done right</span> <span data-start="406.21" data-end="407.56">here we can control at all from the</span> <span data-start="407.56" data-end="410.009">server so we never have to write any</span> <span data-start="410.009" data-end="412.87">client site Ajax stuff anymore it's just</span> <span data-start="412.87" data-end="416.65">all delegated to this thing so the</span> <span data-start="416.65" data-end="419.139">second way we don't write code at learn</span> <span data-start="419.139" data-end="423.4">boost is through our use of Express and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.4" data-end="428.08">Mongoose like I mentioned before Express</span> <span data-start="428.08" data-end="430.78">is our web framework that we're using by</span> <span data-start="430.78" data-end="433.93">TJ Holloway check and Mongoose is what</span> <span data-start="433.93" data-end="437.08">we use as our RM to talk to MongoDB our</span> <span data-start="437.08" data-end="440.259">primary data store so we're going to</span> <span data-start="440.259" data-end="444.4">look at a little demo of how we use</span> <span data-start="444.4" data-end="450.18">these together and so can you see that</span> <span data-start="450.18" data-end="452.74">so we have a this is a typical use case</span> <span data-start="452.74" data-end="455.74">for us we have some route we have a</span> <span data-start="455.74" data-end="459.099">couple queries we want to run if any of</span> <span data-start="459.099" data-end="461.169">the queries return an error we want to</span> <span data-start="461.169" data-end="462.55">make sure that we're only passing that</span> <span data-start="462.55" data-end="466.719">error into next once I don't know how</span> <span data-start="466.719" data-end="468.789">many of you are familiar with express</span> <span data-start="468.789" data-end="473.08">but next will pass the the route the</span> <span data-start="473.08" data-end="475.419">control on to the next route and if</span> <span data-start="475.419" data-end="477.009">there isn't another match for that URL</span> <span data-start="477.009" data-end="479.259">hell just like 404 so anyway we only</span> <span data-start="479.259" data-end="480.969">want to call next once just because</span> <span data-start="480.969" data-end="484.479">otherwise it can cause problems so we're</span> <span data-start="484.479" data-end="487.449">going to check for errors and then if</span> <span data-start="487.449" data-end="489.849">both queries return successfully that we</span> <span data-start="489.849" data-end="493.719">want to render those results and it</span> <span data-start="493.719" data-end="498.73">seems pretty straightforward and it is</span> <span data-start="498.74" data-end="502.069">but it's a lot of boilerplate in my</span> <span data-start="502.069" data-end="504.38">opinion so you know we can see this in</span> <span data-start="504.38" data-end="507.139">action I think if I'm running which I'm</span> <span data-start="507.139" data-end="514.88">not so so they're just running we see</span> <span data-start="514.88" data-end="517.13">that our latest news in there the things</span> <span data-start="517.13" data-end="520.099">we like that's pretty boring but like</span> <span data-start="520.099" data-end="523.58">it's a lot of boilerplate and we don't</span> <span data-start="523.58" data-end="525.2">need to write any of that anymore so</span> <span data-start="525.2" data-end="527.44">what we really want to just write is</span> <span data-start="527.44" data-end="532.31">render and so this is pretty much</span> <span data-start="532.31" data-end="535.73">representative of what we do we just</span> <span data-start="535.73" data-end="539.45">return the result of that query in this</span> <span data-start="539.45" data-end="542.06">case it's get latest news and get this</span> <span data-start="542.06" data-end="543.83">user's likes just pass them straight</span> <span data-start="543.83" data-end="548">into the render call and Express we have</span> <span data-start="548" data-end="550.19">an express Mongoose plugin that's smart</span> <span data-start="550.19" data-end="552.92">enough to to detect when queries or</span> <span data-start="552.92" data-end="556.66">promises are passed in and resolve them</span> <span data-start="556.66" data-end="559.04">appropriately and if any of those return</span> <span data-start="559.04" data-end="562.339">an error of it will likewise pass that</span> <span data-start="562.339" data-end="566.779">air on to next one time so it's still</span> <span data-start="566.779" data-end="569.8">handled gracefully and we don't lose any</span> <span data-start="569.8" data-end="572.48">functionality there so here's a readout</span> <span data-start="572.48" data-end="575.72">the bacon route same result but hey it's</span> <span data-start="575.72" data-end="578.3">with a lot less code so that makes me</span> <span data-start="578.3" data-end="583.43">happy this Express Mongoose plugin is</span> <span data-start="583.43" data-end="586.339">actually something we open sourced this</span> <span data-start="586.339" data-end="588.11">morning even though you see the little</span> <span data-start="588.11" data-end="590.93">lock on there that means it's not open</span> <span data-start="590.93" data-end="592.73">source but it really is I can't refresh</span> <span data-start="592.73" data-end="597.74">the page because I'm not online yeah so</span> <span data-start="597.74" data-end="599.66">if you're using Express and Mongoose you</span> <span data-start="599.66" data-end="604.28">might want to check that out</span> <span data-start="604.29" data-end="608.13">and it's also on NPM the excellent NPM</span> <span data-start="608.13" data-end="611.22">so here's another little trick that we</span> <span data-start="611.22" data-end="614.519">use that it's it's actually quite simple</span> <span data-start="614.519" data-end="618.959">that that TJ kind of stumbled upon but</span> <span data-start="618.959" data-end="621.87">it's it's extremely helpful I really</span> <span data-start="621.87" data-end="622.769">didn't think it would be all that</span> <span data-start="622.769" data-end="625.019">helpful at first but if it's if it's</span> <span data-start="625.019" data-end="629.339">proven actually pretty nice so it's it's</span> <span data-start="629.339" data-end="631.19">instrumenting your code so note has this</span> <span data-start="631.19" data-end="635.069">required out extensions object so you</span> <span data-start="635.069" data-end="636.3">can like I think it's kind of how</span> <span data-start="636.3" data-end="638.699">coffeescript works but it lets you jump</span> <span data-start="638.699" data-end="643.339">in in between that require module call</span> <span data-start="643.339" data-end="646.199">and then do whatever you want with your</span> <span data-start="646.199"

data-end="655.709">into what node cares about so what we do</span> <span data-start="655.709" data-end="659.88">is we just kind of override you actually</span> <span data-start="659.88" data-end="661.8">let me show you an example it might be</span> <span data-start="661.8" data-end="665.94">easier to see what I'm getting at so</span> <span data-start="665.94" data-end="670.519">here's we've got a couple lines here</span> <span data-start="670.519" data-end="674.519">we've got a comment about debug line and</span> <span data-start="674.519" data-end="678.029">then we've got a start and an end and so</span> <span data-start="678.029" data-end="680.61">what we do is we process the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="680.61" data-end="682.709">files when we require them and like</span> <span data-start="682.709" data-end="685.709">parse those in tournament to console dot</span> <span data-start="685.709" data-end="688.56">error or console that time and time end</span> <span data-start="688.56" data-end="691.11">so we can do profiling and all that you</span> <span data-start="691.11" data-end="694.079">might be wondering why we do it this way</span> <span data-start="694.079" data-end="695.31">instead of just putting console that</span> <span data-start="695.31" data-end="697.05">error straight into the code and that's</span> <span data-start="697.05" data-end="699.36">because in production we don't turn</span> <span data-start="699.36" data-end="701.73">profiling or debugging on and then</span> <span data-start="701.73" data-end="704.31">there's no impact of performance so as</span> <span data-start="704.31" data-end="706.41">the debugging you know development tool</span> <span data-start="706.41" data-end="711.899">this is pretty nifty and it's pretty</span> <span data-start="711.899" data-end="714.12">helpful because when we're doing a lot</span> <span data-start="714.12" data-end="717.029">of a sync stuff your call stack gets</span> <span data-start="717.029" data-end="721.61">blown away and it can be helpful to see</span> <span data-start="721.61" data-end="726.029">like where you were in the stack by</span> <span data-start="726.029" data-end="727.92">leaving breadcrumbs or like you know a</span> <span data-start="727.92" data-end="730.62">little trail mm's behind you it's sort</span> <span data-start="730.62" data-end="731.939">of a lame hack or whatever</span> <span data-start="731.939" data-end="734.519">but it really works well and it's it's</span> <span data-start="734.519" data-end="736.649">you don't it doesn't impact anything</span> <span data-start="736.649" data-end="738.629">it's just kind of there if we need it to</span> <span data-start="738.629" data-end="742.769">be and it's also nice to see the output</span> <span data-start="742.769" data-end="745.799">of our the council time if we really</span> <span data-start="745.799" data-end="748.049">need to find out what queries pissing me</span> <span data-start="748.049" data-end="751.739">off or whatever it's very helpful and if</span> <span data-start="751.739" data-end="754.379">you're really having a bad day or</span> <span data-start="754.379" data-end="756.929">somebody's really bothering you at work</span> <span data-start="756.929" data-end="758.939">you can just like sneak this into the</span> <span data-start="758.939" data-end="762.089">code base and then everything blows up</span> <span data-start="762.089" data-end="768.959">and people get really mad yeah really</span> <span data-start="768.959" data-end="771.049">helpful error message when you do that</span> <span data-start="771.049" data-end="776.039">don't do that so let's instrumentation</span> <span data-start="776.039" data-end="780.139">uh and then I'm going to move on to</span> <span data-start="780.139" data-end="783.659">something that's kind of near and dear</span> <span data-start="783.659" data-end="785.759">to my heart and it happens a lot and</span> <span data-start="785.759" data-end="788.999">it's it's a simple mistake it's easy to</span> <span data-start="788.999" data-end="790.859">prevent but it can cause like terrible</span> <span data-start="790.859" data-end="792.359">things that happen in your application</span> <span data-start="792.359" data-end="796.289">as we've seen from experience just</span> <span data-start="796.289" data-end="797.639">global variable leaks you know you're</span> <span data-start="797.639" data-end="801.049">missing a var statement somewhere and</span> <span data-start="801.049" data-end="803.399">suddenly you know what you think is one</span> <span data-start="803.399" data-end="804.689">value turns into something else</span> <span data-start="804.689" data-end="807.869">especially when it comes to the modules</span> <span data-start="807.869" data-end="812.22">that you're requiring and so they like</span> <span data-start="812.22" data-end="813.599">prevent that there's a couple things we</span> <span data-start="813.599" data-end="818.039">can do and that's in my opinion</span> <span data-start="818.039" data-end="820.379">supporting like a using comma first but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="820.379" data-end="822.359">I mean that's not it's just one little</span> <span data-start="822.359" data-end="824.819">thing what's more helpful for us is this</span> <span data-start="824.819" data-end="827.279">thing I ripped off from node in their</span> <span data-start="827.279" data-end="832.289">tests a few months back was this global</span> <span data-start="832.289" data-end="833.97">leak test so basically there's this</span> <span data-start="833.97" data-end="837.179">array of all the Global's that are known</span> <span data-start="837.179" data-end="840.119">to node and if something shows up there</span> <span data-start="840.119" data-end="843.389">that we don't know about we want to</span> <span data-start="843.389" data-end="846.509">print on our on our console as we're</span> <span data-start="846.509" data-end="849.239">developing so all this does is just go</span> <span data-start="849.239" data-end="851.129">through the Global's that we know about</span> <span data-start="851.129" data-end="853.439">if it finds anything it's not supposed</span> <span data-start="853.439" data-end="855.209">to be there we're going to return that</span> <span data-start="855.209" data-end="860.639">in an array and then what we do then is</span> <span data-start="860.639" data-end="864.19">we just require HTTP and then override</span> <span data-start="864.19" data-end="867.07">proxy to send method off of that right</span> <span data-start="867.07" data-end="871.78">here which runs the normal method as it</span> <span data-start="871.78" data-end="874.45">were before however we report all leaks</span> <span data-start="874.45" data-end="878.2">that show up afterward so here's what we</span> <span data-start="878.2" data-end="879.79">just were looking at a minute ago Lisa</span> <span data-start="879.79" data-end="883.18">find iterate that array if there is</span> <span data-start="883.18" data-end="884.47">something in that array that we didn't</span> <span data-start="884.47" data-end="887.32">know about already then we want a mark</span> <span data-start="887.32" data-end="889.57">we want to we want to record that we've</span> <span data-start="889.57" data-end="893.4">seen it and output it to the console and</span> <span data-start="893.4" data-end="898.21">so to give you an example what that</span> <span data-start="898.21" data-end="902.14">looks like we run it at startup and then</span> <span data-start="902.14" data-end="906.32">after every route runs so in this case</span> <span data-start="906.33" data-end="908.89">there's six unknown Global's that really</span> <span data-start="908.89" data-end="910.9">shouldn't be there and those were</span> <span data-start="910.9" data-end="913.51">actually all caused by node MongoDB</span> <span data-start="913.51" data-end="916.6">native which we already patched but in</span> <span data-start="916.6" data-end="918.34">this isn't perfect right it doesn't say</span> <span data-start="918.34" data-end="920.35">hey in this module you messed up and</span> <span data-start="920.35" data-end="921.88">it's not jslint and a lot of other</span> <span data-start="921.88" data-end="924.16">things but it's really it stands it's</span> <span data-start="924.16" data-end="925.72">out of your way it runs after every</span> <span data-start="925.72" data-end="927.34">route runs and it gives you immediate</span> <span data-start="927.34" data-end="929.08">feedback like hey you know somewhere in</span> <span data-start="929.08" data-end="930.37">this route we've got something going</span> <span data-start="930.37" data-end="932.02">wrong and you're kind of playing with</span> <span data-start="932.02" data-end="936.37">fire something shows up here yeah</span> <span data-start="936.37" data-end="937.78">because again in our experience we had</span> <span data-start="937.78" data-end="940.48">for example a module called errors which</span> <span data-start="940.48" data-end="943.3">we required at the top and we used VAR</span> <span data-start="943.3" data-end="946.93">errors equals require errors and then in</span> <span data-start="946.93" data-end="948.97">a route somewhere we've missed a</span> <span data-start="948.97" data-end="953.95">trailing comma and the you know the</span> <span data-start="953.95" data-end="955.75">variable was errors so it over wrote our</span> <span data-start="955.75" data-end="957.94">module and then we were it led to all</span> <span data-start="957.94" data-end="960.7">sorts of impossible to track down bugs</span> <span data-start="960.7" data-end="963.04">in production and like we wanted to rip</span> <span data-start="963.04" data-end="966.49">our hair out so these techniques have</span> <span data-start="966.49" data-end="969.31">really helped us out help us avoid those</span> <span data-start="969.31" data-end="974.74">situations in the future and that's</span> <span data-start="974.74" data-end="976.53">about all I have to talk about today</span> <span data-start="976.53" data-end="978.85">code is cool products are better thank</span> <span data-start="978.85" data-end="981.06">you</span> </p>
