<p><span data-start="12.83" data-end="16.29">Today I'm going to be speaking about deliberate, direct positive action.</span> <span data-start="16.29" data-end="17.29">During the day, oops.</span> <span data-start="17.29" data-end="18.29">I'm a slide ahead.</span> <span data-start="18.29" data-end="19.29">I think I'll just start again.</span> <span data-start="19.29" data-end="22.57">So, during the day I work at litmus where we built something called email creative platform.</span> <span data-start="22.57" data-end="25.52">My day job involves looking after a team.</span> <span data-start="25.52" data-end="31">We build the app with JavaScript, Rails in an agile fashion.</span> <span data-start="31" data-end="32.88">We all work remotely.</span> <span data-start="32.88" data-end="34.28">Currently we're hiring.</span> <span data-start="34.28" data-end="41.1">If you would like to if this sounds interesting, please catch me later.</span> <span data-start="41.1" data-end="47.76">Previously I spent many years organizing Scotland CSS and Scotland JS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.76" data-end="54.579">And now I focus my community efforts on something called global diversity CFP day which is going</span> <span data-start="54.579" data-end="57.489">to be the focus of our talk today.</span> <span data-start="57.489" data-end="62.249">And what I learned throughputting this together.</span> <span data-start="62.249" data-end="69.9">Just to give you an idea what that is, on a single day we host a load of workshops all</span> <span data-start="69.9" data-end="76.03">around the world with the sole aim of supporting and encouraging people from underrepresented</span> <span data-start="76.03" data-end="81.33">and marginalized groups and putting together their first tech conference proposal.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="81.33" data-end="89.23">The aim, thereby, being if more people from these groups apply, then you'll see more people</span> <span data-start="89.23" data-end="94.22">with different coming from different backgrounds with different experiences and different perspectives</span> <span data-start="94.22" data-end="97.96">and sharing that on stages like this.</span> <span data-start="97.96" data-end="104.43">So, to just I want to introduce some definitions here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="104.43" data-end="112.69">Because I get a whole lot of questions around two of the terms in the title of the event</span> <span data-start="112.69" data-end="113.69">name.</span> <span data-start="113.69" data-end="116.51">First up, diversity.</span> <span data-start="116.51" data-end="124.66">What we're talking about here is something that is contextually dependent on your location</span> <span data-start="124.66" data-end="126.21">in the world.</span> <span data-start="126.21" data-end="135.319">And excuse me it's usually easier to describe who diversity doesn't apply to.</span> <span data-start="135.319" data-end="144.18">And so, in the western part of the world, the people that make up the majority of the</span> <span data-start="144.18" data-end="151.599">workforce, the privileged group, as I would describe them, are the cis white hetero men</span> <span data-start="151.599" data-end="153.439">like myself.</span> <span data-start="153.439" data-end="162.209">And pretty much if all of those things, cis white, hetero, able bodied, man, if there's</span> <span data-start="162.209" data-end="169.06">any of those that don't apply to an individual, usually diversity refers to that individual.</span> <span data-start="169.06" data-end="171.749">Does that make sense?</span> <span data-start="171.749" data-end="174.98">And there's another question that I get.</span> <span data-start="174.98" data-end="180.969">Or variance of any time I'm involved in a diversity and inclusion initiative.</span> <span data-start="180.969" data-end="190.069">And these questions usually come from someone who presents, like myself, and are along the</span> <span data-start="190.069" data-end="194.16">lines of, can I participate in this event?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194.16" data-end="201.43">Because I think diversity applies to me because I work with this really, really obscure database</span> <span data-start="201.43" data-end="205.489">technology.</span> <span data-start="205.489" data-end="208.769">In case you're wondering, folks: No.</span> <span data-start="208.769" data-end="213.239">Next up, we've got the acronym CFP.</span> <span data-start="213.239" data-end="214.999">That stands for call for proposals.</span> <span data-start="214.999" data-end="222.409">This is effectively a process that a tech conference like this would open to encourage</span> <span data-start="222.409" data-end="229.709">the community to come forward to propose topics and share their knowledge and experience.</span> <span data-start="229.709" data-end="235.329">So, who is this talk for?</span> <span data-start="235.329" data-end="241.409">As I mentioned, this is a talk about the things that I've learned through organizing this</span> <span data-start="241.409" data-end="242.409">event.</span> <span data-start="242.409" data-end="246.189">And there's gonna be things that will be useful from a management perspective.</span> <span data-start="246.189" data-end="250.439">If you are bringing a diversity and inclusion initiative, perhaps in the workplace.</span> <span data-start="250.439" data-end="258.829">If you want to be a better member of the tech community, if you organize meetups, if you</span> <span data-start="258.829" data-end="260.31">organize conferences.</span> <span data-start="260.31" data-end="267.099">So, given that all of you are part of the JavaScript community, this talk is very much</span> <span data-start="267.099" data-end="269.12">for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.12" data-end="277.59">So, the rough order of service, I suppose, today, is we'll be talking through where did</span> <span data-start="277.59" data-end="280.199">CFP Day come from?</span> <span data-start="280.199" data-end="281.759">What happens during a workshop?</span> <span data-start="281.759" data-end="284.27">What's involved in organizing a workshop?</span> <span data-start="284.27" data-end="288.18">And through that there will be the sort of things that I have learned.</span> <span data-start="288.18" data-end="291.87">So, where did global diversity CFP Day come from?</span> <span data-start="291.87" data-end="299.68">It won't surprise you to discover that this grew out of my experience running conferences.</span> <span data-start="299.68" data-end="308.19">And I think from 2013 to 2015 when the call for proposals process was open for those conferences,</span> <span data-start="308.19" data-end="312.93">to encourage and engage people to apply to speak.</span> <span data-start="312.93" data-end="318.25">I would host a number of, like, video public video call sessions.</span> <span data-start="318.25" data-end="322.31">And it was kind of like meet the organizer and some previous speakers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="322.31" data-end="326.37">If you have any questions, you know, let's try and address them and encourage you to</span> <span data-start="326.37" data-end="329.41">apply to speak.</span> <span data-start="329.41" data-end="339.44">And by 2015, I had really no idea how many people from those calls were actually applying</span> <span data-start="339.44" data-end="341.27">or making the final lineup.</span> <span data-start="341.27" data-end="344.34">So, was this worthwhile?</span> <span data-start="344.34" data-end="353.46">And in 2015 at the after party, after giving our talk, Katie Fenn and I were chatting at</span> <span data-start="353.46" data-end="355.189">the after party.</span> <span data-start="355.189" data-end="362.949">And Katie mentioned that the video calls that she attended was just the nudge that she needed</span> <span data-start="362.949" data-end="366.629">to finally put together that first talk proposal.</span> <span data-start="366.629" data-end="371.93">And if I remember correctly, Katie, kind of like myself, when it came to trying to</span> <span data-start="371.93" data-end="379.63">or to doing this kind of thing, procas somebody want to say it for me?</span> <span data-start="379.63" data-end="381.741">Procrastination was really getting in the way.</span> <span data-start="381.741" data-end="388.55">So, if we fast forward to 2016.</span> <span data-start="388.55" data-end="391.8">Again, the CFP was open.</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="399.15">And I was trying to figure out a way of, you know, these video calls were useful.</span> <span data-start="399.15" data-end="400.47">But how could we amplify that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="400.47" data-end="406.949">How could we do something that was more direct, targeted, positive in terms of supporting</span> <span data-start="406.949" data-end="409.9">people from underrepresented and marginalized groups?</span> <span data-start="409.9" data-end="413.56">And that was a good question.</span> <span data-start="413.56" data-end="418.43">And how do we go about answering it?</span> <span data-start="418.43" data-end="423.86">Then three days later I just kind of sat up first thing in the morning and the idea just</span> <span data-start="423.86" data-end="425.72">had kind of came to me in any head.</span> <span data-start="425.72" data-end="429.27">And that was the idea of hosting a diversity CFP workshop.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.27" data-end="436.3">And that was specifically to encourage people to apply to Scotland JS and Scotland CSS.</span> <span data-start="436.3" data-end="446.11">So, this idea of having a workshop, you know, it was like, what was I doing?</span> <span data-start="446.11" data-end="449.65">I already, you know, I've got a full time job.</span> <span data-start="449.65" data-end="451">I've got family to look after.</span> <span data-start="451" data-end="453.919">And, you know, tend to and spend time with.</span> <span data-start="453.919" data-end="458.729">We've got we had two dogs that were running wild.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="458.729" data-end="461.18">I was organizing two conferences.</span> <span data-start="461.18" data-end="469.229">Let痴 lets run a workshop here, yeah, in a couple of weeks' time.</span> <span data-start="469.229" data-end="472.919">And then I sort of started chatting to people.</span> <span data-start="472.919" data-end="478.59">For instance, Katie, who said, you know, as soon as I shared this idea Katie said, can</span> <span data-start="478.59" data-end="480.52">I run one in Sheffield?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="480.52" data-end="486.77">I was chatting to a friend in Dublin, oh, we'll run one too.</span> <span data-start="486.77" data-end="493.24">And this kind of snowballed from having to effectively having a workshop in three</span> <span data-start="493.24" data-end="503.55">weeks' time in Glasgow in Scotland, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Dublin, London and Berlin.</span> <span data-start="503.55" data-end="509.86">I did literally get in touch with Robin from Berlin JS thinking, everybody was saying yes.</span> <span data-start="509.86" data-end="514.979">Just for a laugh, what do you think if we got this to happen in Berlin?</span> <span data-start="514.979" data-end="518.599">And Robin said, yes.</span> <span data-start="518.599" data-end="524.08">So, running those workshops I think it was about 60 people attended.</span> <span data-start="524.08" data-end="532.7">And it had a massive impact on the diversity of applicants to the conferences to speak.</span> <span data-start="532.7" data-end="540.74">And in terms of the lineup, particularly for Scotland JS, it had a massive, massive impact.</span> <span data-start="540.74" data-end="543.889">In terms, 60 people attended these workshops.</span> <span data-start="543.889" data-end="549.7">And there were 17 slots available for that conference.</span> <span data-start="549.7" data-end="555.17">And three people from those workshops were speakers that year.</span> <span data-start="555.17" data-end="559.62">And bear in mind there was like 200 applicants to speak.</span> <span data-start="559.62" data-end="563.16">So, that was just it just validated the idea.</span> <span data-start="563.16" data-end="571.75">But in terms of putting these workshops together, I wanted everybody to have a the attendees</span> <span data-start="571.75" data-end="575.839">at each workshop to get a consistent message and set of advice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="575.839" data-end="581.26">And to try to make that happen, I wanted to sort of provide that message.</span> <span data-start="581.26" data-end="586.649">But at the same time, you know, because I didn't want six different groups of people</span> <span data-start="586.649" data-end="592.399">trying to put together their own workshop on really short notice.</span> <span data-start="592.399" data-end="598.269">They're already running about looking for venues and mentors and team members and all</span> <span data-start="598.269" data-end="599.269">this kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="599.269" data-end="605.139">And so, I thought, how can we sort of make this a whole lot simpler?</span> <span data-start="605.139" data-end="608.62">How can we boil this down to like a conversation?</span> <span data-start="608.62" data-end="613.38">So, I was thinking, could we how could we make this happen?</span> <span data-start="613.38" data-end="619.56">And I got in touch with Raquel and Sarah Mei and asked, if there any chance that the two</span> <span data-start="619.56" data-end="629.23">of you could make some time to have a chat and share and discuss things like advice around</span> <span data-start="629.23" data-end="630.62">putting together a proposal?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.62" data-end="634.74">What would you put in the title, in the abstract, the description fields?</span> <span data-start="634.74" data-end="637.37">And your experiences of that.</span> <span data-start="637.37" data-end="640.64">The highs and lows of being accepted, being rejected from events.</span> <span data-start="640.64" data-end="645.06">And on the flipside, you know, what's your experience with being in review committees.</span> <span data-start="645.06" data-end="649.06">Knowing that they both had done that kind of thing.</span> <span data-start="649.06" data-end="653.48">Oh, and can you get it to us in the next fortnight, please?</span> <span data-start="653.48" data-end="654.48">Two weeks?</span> <span data-start="654.48" data-end="655.8">And they said yes.</span> <span data-start="655.8" data-end="657.24">What's going on?</span> <span data-start="657.24" data-end="663.11">How can we put this burden on so many people and they just keep on saying yes?</span> <span data-start="663.11" data-end="668.721">And so, with those videos we were able to enable all of the workshops that were actual</span> <span data-start="668.721" data-end="671.11">material to get going a whole lot quicker.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="671.11" data-end="675.55">And so, enable people is the first thing to call out there.</span> <span data-start="675.55" data-end="681.709">So, the event was, let's see, right about the June time in 2016.</span> <span data-start="681.709" data-end="690.24">And come about August time I had finally sort of my brain had reconstituted enough that</span> <span data-start="690.24" data-end="698.95">I'm sure the organizers say that's the same, running these types of events.</span> <span data-start="698.95" data-end="710.73">And given the huge impact we mentioned earlier on Scotland JS, how could we well, it was</span> <span data-start="710.73" data-end="715.82">more like, there was nothing in the workshop, there was nothing that was JavaScript specific.</span> <span data-start="715.82" data-end="719.769">There was nothing CSS specific.</span> <span data-start="719.769" data-end="722">And there wasn't really anything even Scotland specific.</span> <span data-start="722" data-end="727.079">It kind of made me feel a little bit sad in that regard.</span> <span data-start="727.079" data-end="730.399">But let's turn the frown upside down.</span> <span data-start="730.399" data-end="737.35">You know, could this concept be shared with all tech communities and support all of the</span> <span data-start="737.35" data-end="740.69">people within those communities?</span> <span data-start="740.69" data-end="745.92">Could this be shared with all tech communities everywhere?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="745.92" data-end="747.41">Which I still struggle with.</span> <span data-start="747.41" data-end="748.41">Just seems huge.</span> <span data-start="748.41" data-end="751.639">How does this all come to be?</span> <span data-start="751.639" data-end="759.19">So, next up, what happens during a workshop?</span> <span data-start="759.19" data-end="768.7">If you come along to attend a workshop, there's a whole host of people that have are keen</span> <span data-start="768.7" data-end="771.67">to egg you on and make this happen for you.</span> <span data-start="771.67" data-end="777.3">I've already mentioned Raquel and Sarah giving you CFP advice.</span> <span data-start="777.3" data-end="783.37">Danielle, will help you in crafting your biography.</span> <span data-start="783.37" data-end="789.199">Saran will help you put together your perfect tech talk.</span> </p>
