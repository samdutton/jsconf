<p><span data-start="17.89" data-end="24.04">Thank you, general, that was very kind of you, hi, everyone, I'm Brad Bouse as Jen said,</span> <span data-start="24.04" data-end="25.93">I'm from Seattle.</span> <span data-start="25.93" data-end="31.7">Seattle is the city in the northwestern corner of the United States, we have a lot of coffee,</span> <span data-start="31.7" data-end="36.75">we have a lot of men with beards, we have a lot of tattoos, and we have a lot of rain,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="36.75" data-end="40.46">I feel really at home here in Berlin, it's great.</span> <span data-start="40.46" data-end="47.07">I work as a front end engineer, products manager, mostly for very early stage start ups, I like</span> <span data-start="47.07" data-end="51.07">figuring out what should and should not be in a product.</span> <span data-start="51.07" data-end="54.32">So, I have a little bit of advice for you.</span> <span data-start="54.32" data-end="60.71">Now, I just want to clear something upright now, I know that there's been rumors, this</span> <span data-start="60.71" data-end="65.32">is actually not about the Apple Watch.</span> <span data-start="65.32" data-end="70.179">I know the timing kind of worked out that that might be what it's about, it's actually</span> <span data-start="70.179" data-end="71.36">something different.</span> <span data-start="71.36" data-end="77.18">Marking something useless sounds, it's a funny thing to say, maybe that's why you're here,</span> <span data-start="77.18" data-end="81.86">it's not how we think about things, we normally think about things and their utility, we've</span> <span data-start="81.86" data-end="88.06">learned a lot of really useful things to day, I don't know if that's always the best idea.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="88.06" data-end="94.92">So, there's one question that as professional developers, engineers that you've been asked,</span> <span data-start="94.92" data-end="99.229">be asked by your boss, your product manager, your client.</span> <span data-start="99.229" data-end="108.25">And that question is how long will it take? And, if you're like me, that's your answer.</span> <span data-start="108.25" data-end="117.81">And if you're really like me, and then you just want to tell them to go away.</span> <span data-start="117.81" data-end="122.31">You have to deal with this problem, the reason why this causes us a lot of anxiety is that</span> <span data-start="122.31" data-end="127.119">we have to distill all the come collated things that could go on in this product, in this</span> <span data-start="127.119" data-end="131.29">feature, in this bug all the things that could go wrong, we have to distill that down to</span> <span data-start="131.29" data-end="137.36">a number, have to turn that to a date, we have to commit to it, every decision we make</span> <span data-start="137.36" data-end="143.829">along the road we have to meet that number this is how we solve problems professionally.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="143.829" data-end="153.23">We put them into a mechanism that managers times, manager chunks of problems to land</span> <span data-start="153.23" data-end="157.64">the project in finish state, sometimes down the road.</span> <span data-start="157.64" data-end="160.849">And along the way we have to make a lot of compromises, we have to keep saying, oh, we</span> <span data-start="160.849" data-end="165.672">can't do this, we can't do that, because we don't have a lot of time that's okay, that's</span> <span data-start="165.672" data-end="169.78">how it works, with eve got to make money\h‑‑ we have to make money, business has to go</span> <span data-start="169.78" data-end="176.95">on, the one thing that this does is it stops us from exploring code, it stops us from playing</span> <span data-start="176.95" data-end="178.7">with code.</span> <span data-start="178.7" data-end="183.099">The reason I want you to do something useless, take a little bit of time and do something</span> <span data-start="183.099" data-end="187.6">where there's no dead line where nobody cares if it's finished.</span> <span data-start="187.6" data-end="190.879">This is the waterfall swing.</span> <span data-start="190.879" data-end="195.38">They have been doing well with this, tail brought it around to different installations</span> <span data-start="195.38" data-end="198.7">in different cities, and this just looks fun.</span> <span data-start="198.7" data-end="205.65">If you\h‑‑ if you, I would really rather be there right now, in fact.</span> <span data-start="205.65" data-end="210.59">If you ride this and you're not giggling like a little schoolgirl, you're just not human,</span> <span data-start="210.59" data-end="212.959">it looks like a lot of fun.</span> <span data-start="212.959" data-end="217.989">So what this is called, broadly speaking, is creative coding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="217.989" data-end="222.83">It's a little bit of problematic term because it has a gait in coding, yee creative coding</span> <span data-start="222.83" data-end="229.79">is a qualifier, yee creative is a good thing, if you don't feel like you're creative, can</span> <span data-start="229.79" data-end="234.209">you do yee creative coding? That's a problem I'd like to talk about, that's what I'd like</span> <span data-start="234.209" data-end="235.379">to work through today.</span> <span data-start="235.379" data-end="240.59">So the first thing is Iv to say is don't be afraid I've been talking about yee creative</span> <span data-start="240.59" data-end="246.459">code for a while, and a lot of people say that's really neat, but it's not for me, I'm</span> <span data-start="246.459" data-end="250.629">not yee creative, I'm not good at that, my stuff doesn't look good.</span> <span data-start="250.629" data-end="252.439">I can't do that.</span> <span data-start="252.439" data-end="253.439">That's okay.</span> <span data-start="253.439" data-end="256.549">It's really natural.</span> <span data-start="256.549" data-end="260.579">When mess of you think ant art, you probably think about something like this\h‑‑ think</span> <span data-start="260.579" data-end="268.14">art you probably think about this, this is a masterpiece, Rembrant, he looks like a million</span> <span data-start="268.14" data-end="273.75">bucks, it probably is way more than a million bucks, he's worth multiple million bucks,</span> <span data-start="273.75" data-end="278.59">if you're like me, you might have sat down and try to draw something, maybe you tried</span> <span data-start="278.59" data-end="287.82">to draw this? (Laughing) and I'll admit, like I, I didn't draw that, I Googled it, I took</span> <span data-start="287.82" data-end="292.719">a terrible child's drawing because I was too embarrassed of my own bad drawing to put it</span> <span data-start="292.719" data-end="295.13">on screen.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.13" data-end="297.81">This is kind of my favorite illustration of the problem.</span> <span data-start="297.81" data-end="303.539">And it's what you see all over the place where experts will give you a tutorial where it</span> <span data-start="303.539" data-end="306.53">starts to go, way, way, way too fast.</span> <span data-start="306.53" data-end="310.59">And when you're an expert you never see all these geniuses you never see all the crap</span> <span data-start="310.59" data-end="312.289">that they actually make.</span> <span data-start="312.289" data-end="315.919">You never see their process when they're making art.</span> <span data-start="315.919" data-end="318.55">You just draw the rest of it out.</span> <span data-start="318.55" data-end="324.63">So Ira glass is an American talk show host, he has a great talk about this very problem.</span> <span data-start="324.63" data-end="329.969">He said asacriative person the first thing you probably have is taste, you know kind</span> <span data-start="329.969" data-end="335.479">of what's good, what's bad, and you have an opinion about the way things should be, when</span> <span data-start="335.479" data-end="340.32">you sit down to make something for the very first time, you make it, you're disappointed</span> <span data-start="340.32" data-end="345.05">you know your taste is work against you, you know this stuff is not as good as what you</span> <span data-start="345.05" data-end="348.57">see out there, what you like, he call this is the gap.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="348.57" data-end="354.18">I think that's\h‑‑ everybody faces this, and the only way to cross this grab is with</span> <span data-start="354.18" data-end="359.96">practice, you have to take a step back, recognize that I'm at this gap, and I can cross it,</span> <span data-start="359.96" data-end="362.31">I can cross it by doing work.</span> <span data-start="362.31" data-end="368.18">Put in practice, I can put in time, I can work on this process.</span> <span data-start="368.18" data-end="375.99">This is Chuck Close, he is an American artist, this was in 1968, I believe.</span> <span data-start="375.99" data-end="380.77">His quote that I really like, inspiration is for amateurs the rest of us just show up</span> <span data-start="380.77" data-end="383.5">and get the work.</span> <span data-start="383.5" data-end="388.06">Chuck Close is an artist that believers in process, he believe in doing work.</span> <span data-start="388.06" data-end="390">This is actually a huge painting.</span> <span data-start="390" data-end="395.95">It's an 8‑foot by 8‑foot painting, it's glorious to behold, if you get a chance to</span> <span data-start="395.95" data-end="404.789">see it please do, each whisker is beautifully render, the bouquet around his face, it's</span> <span data-start="404.789" data-end="407.93">a luminous painting.</span> <span data-start="407.93" data-end="409.49">And he puts in the work.</span> <span data-start="409.49" data-end="416.18">And he's actually made a career out of these extremely photo realistic large form pictures.</span> <span data-start="416.18" data-end="422.12">And you can see his style evolves you can understand this is a man that's showing up</span> <span data-start="422.12" data-end="426.08">to work, he's putting in the hours and he's making great work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="426.08" data-end="432.709">I don't what his first work started out like, but I imagine it evolved and he got better.</span> <span data-start="432.709" data-end="437.66">Maybe he started out drawing the two little circles, I don't know.</span> <span data-start="437.66" data-end="442.93">So what this\h‑‑ when I see this, we like to think kind of culturally as artists as</span> <span data-start="442.93" data-end="446.83">being struck by a lightening bolt, maybe they're lounging on a hill somewhere, they're struck</span> <span data-start="446.83" data-end="454.49">by a lightening bolt of sudden inspirery inspiration and they paint the Mona Lisa, whatever, whatever</span> <span data-start="454.49" data-end="460.039">is an amazing piece of work, but that's not the case, they're men, they're women, they're</span> <span data-start="460.039" data-end="464.83">working, they're struggling and they're putting in the hours, showing up for work, working</span> <span data-start="464.83" data-end="472.16">on a process, and when you're feeling bad about whatever you're markinge, think about</span> <span data-start="472.16" data-end="475.94">process as your savety net, know that if you keep working at it.</span> <span data-start="475.94" data-end="478.029">You'll get better.</span> <span data-start="478.029" data-end="481.93">The reason why you want to keep working when you're trying to make something is great ideas</span> <span data-start="481.93" data-end="483.44">are really hidden.</span> <span data-start="483.44" data-end="488.099">There's a theory I really like strew art Kaufman it's about adjacent possible.</span> <span data-start="488.099" data-end="495.38">It's about evolution, we think about evolution as a linear path where we went straight out</span> <span data-start="495.38" data-end="500.75">of the muck to bee become Homo sapienses, that's not how it worked, it was a lurching</span> <span data-start="500.75" data-end="508.01">process, one evolution beget another evolution, by the time we got to a third evolution it's</span> <span data-start="508.01" data-end="511.219">a completely different space from where we started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="511.219" data-end="516.019">Ideas work the same way, if you're exploring an idea, a project, you don't know what's</span> <span data-start="516.019" data-end="521.46">going to happen right away, you have to work, put in the hours and maybe you'll see something</span> <span data-start="521.46" data-end="522.76">new that will happen.</span> <span data-start="522.76" data-end="527.46">We have this in our own live in start ups, it's called a five pivot.</span> <span data-start="527.46" data-end="532.87">Sometimes it's a cover for something else, the classical use of pivot, they explore a</span> <span data-start="532.87" data-end="536.76">space, they see something else is Bert that they didn't see before and they move into</span> <span data-start="536.76" data-end="537.76">it.</span> <span data-start="537.76" data-end="543.86">So if you combine these two things, idea of working a process of crossing the gap and</span> <span data-start="543.86" data-end="548.52">exploring where you are at every stage youv a powerful mechanism to make something new</span> <span data-start="548.52" data-end="550.06">and interesting.</span> <span data-start="550.06" data-end="556.25">Now, it's important for me to say, that I'm not an artist, I'm not particularly blessed</span> <span data-start="556.25" data-end="562.26">with creativity, what I am good at is streamlining processes, I'm good at understanding how things</span> <span data-start="562.26" data-end="568.9">work, but as you see I'm married to an artist, this is Anne\h‑‑ she is a poetty professor,</span> <span data-start="568.9" data-end="576.95">I have been to far more than my share of poetry reading, performance arts museums and all</span> <span data-start="576.95" data-end="583.75">strange things, I feel as an ambassador from strange lands to share what I've learned as</span> <span data-start="583.75" data-end="586.06">an engineer.</span> </p>
