<p><span data-start="213.04" data-end="220.8">This documentation seems pretty bare boneses so I've actually been following this other</span> <span data-start="220.8" data-end="224.48">emulator's documentation.</span> <span data-start="224.48" data-end="233.46">Turns out all these old game console emulate y they have the exact same Lua API I guess</span> <span data-start="233.46" data-end="238.54">because they're all open source and once one implemented it the other ones were like, cool,</span> <span data-start="238.54" data-end="242.22">gonna copy and paste that.</span> <span data-start="242.22" data-end="249.16">You can do stuff like read and write bytes to the game's memory, like the RAM and ROM</span> <span data-start="249.16" data-end="259.84">and that kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="259.84" data-end="263.46">I'm going to have this Twilio phone number set up so that I can programmatically control</span> <span data-start="263.46" data-end="269.44">T so whenever you send a text message to this phone number and it's a 760 phone number which</span> <span data-start="269.44" data-end="271.49">I think is an area code around here.</span> <span data-start="271.49" data-end="278.05">So whenever you send a text to that number Twilio is going to send a post address to</span> <span data-start="278.05" data-end="286.57">this address right here, which is basically a tunnel to a port on my local machine that</span> <span data-start="286.57" data-end="290.28">my Node express app is going to be listening on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="290.28" data-end="293.3">That app does not exist yet so we'll get to that later.</span> <span data-start="293.3" data-end="297.93">If you text this number right now, literally nothing will happen because it will be dropped</span> <span data-start="297.93" data-end="302.37">on the floor because the code doesn't exist.</span> <span data-start="302.37" data-end="307.1">I'll show it on the screen later so you don't have to copy it down right now.</span> <span data-start="307.1" data-end="311.59">Anyway, let's get into the basics of how to write code for this Game Boy emulator.</span> <span data-start="311.59" data-end="321.55">I'm going to do a Hello World thing, you might have seen on this, I have my Twitter handle</span> <span data-start="321.55" data-end="324.57">up on the Game Boy emulator.</span> <span data-start="324.57" data-end="346.68">My  Twitter is sagnewshreds,</span> <span data-start="346.68" data-end="357.34">I'm going to say hello, JSConf with a smiley face, and I'm going to save that and I'm going</span> <span data-start="357.34" data-end="362.199">to stop this other script from happening.</span> <span data-start="362.199" data-end="368.77">And I'm going to go find this Lua script on my computer in my talks folder in the JSConf</span> <span data-start="368.77" data-end="376.04">folder and I'm going to run that and it says, hello, JSConf cool, we've run some Lua.</span> <span data-start="376.04" data-end="378.32">But it disappeared.</span> <span data-start="378.32" data-end="383.27">And the reason is it's only running once.</span> <span data-start="383.27" data-end="388.87">We can repeatedly print this on every frame if we want it to stay.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="388.87" data-end="392.479">And for that we need to write an infinite loop.</span> <span data-start="392.479" data-end="393.93">Because infinite loops rule, right?</span> <span data-start="393.93" data-end="397.12">We write those all the time.</span> <span data-start="397.12" data-end="401.58">Because this emulator, the whole environment in there is single threaded this will actually</span> <span data-start="401.58" data-end="403.84">stop the game from even playing.</span> <span data-start="403.84" data-end="409.9">So this emu object gives you a function where you can control the frames so you can advance</span> <span data-start="409.9" data-end="411.21">to the next frame.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.21" data-end="417.15">This way our infinite loop is pretty much taking over the run time of the game so that</span> <span data-start="417.15" data-end="420.47">each iteration of this loop is going to be one frame of the game.</span> <span data-start="420.47" data-end="425.29">So all this code will execute on each frame so I'm going to advance to the next frame</span> <span data-start="425.29" data-end="428.84">at the end of each loop and going to restart that and now the hello JSConf is going to</span> <span data-start="428.84" data-end="433.87">stay there.</span> <span data-start="433.87" data-end="436.52">Now I'm going to write some useful stuff.</span> <span data-start="436.52" data-end="441.9">So what we want to do is this Lua script is going to communicate with our Node.js stuff.</span> <span data-start="441.9" data-end="444.63">I know this is JSConf and I'm writing Lua.</span> <span data-start="444.63" data-end="445.949">I'm not much of a Lua developer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.949" data-end="451.52">I don't know how many of you in this room consider yourselves Lua developers, but I'm</span> <span data-start="451.52" data-end="453.259">not particularly.</span> <span data-start="453.259" data-end="458.68">So I'm going to write some code to communicate with that Node.js and we're going to do something</span> <span data-start="458.68" data-end="460.699">technologically advanced here.</span> <span data-start="460.699" data-end="461.699">Really complicated stuff.</span> <span data-start="461.699" data-end="465.51">We're going to communicate by reading and writing to text files.</span> <span data-start="465.51" data-end="472.55">Yeah, so on each frame I'm going to read from a file called button.txt, to see if a button</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="473.65">was pressed.</span> <span data-start="473.65" data-end="478.169">So I'm going to write some utility function, so I'm going to write a function that can</span> <span data-start="478.169" data-end="485.45">read a file and then I'm going to open that file.</span> <span data-start="485.45" data-end="488.85">If I can type correctly.</span> <span data-start="488.85" data-end="489.85">Cool.</span> <span data-start="489.85" data-end="493.84">So I'm going to open that file name with the read flag and then I'm going to check to see</span> <span data-start="493.84" data-end="501.94">if that file actually exists, so if it's nil, then I'm going to set the input to be that</span> <span data-start="501.94" data-end="507.16">file, and then I'm going to create a variable called content and read the contents of that</span> <span data-start="507.16" data-end="508.68">file into it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.68" data-end="512.669">And then I'm going to close the file, because you always gotta close something you open.</span> <span data-start="512.669" data-end="515.44">You gotta finish what you started, right?</span> <span data-start="515.44" data-end="519.459">And then I'm going to return the content of the file which should just be a string of</span> <span data-start="519.459" data-end="521.419">whatever was in the file.</span> <span data-start="521.419" data-end="526.839">And next I'm going to write a quick function to press a button in the game.</span> <span data-start="526.839" data-end="533.98">So this is going to take a button, just like the text of a button, like A, B, start, select,</span> <span data-start="533.98" data-end="536.199">up, down, something like that.</span> <span data-start="536.199" data-end="542.8">And the way the joy pad API works in this Lua scripting is that it takes a table of</span> <span data-start="542.8" data-end="546.759">buttons, like a key value kind of thing, like a JavaScript object or a Python dictionary</span> <span data-start="546.759" data-end="552.689">and it takes the button name and true or false for whether that button is being pressed or</span> <span data-start="552.689" data-end="553.689">not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="553.689" data-end="557.209">So I'm just going to create an input table here.</span> <span data-start="557.209" data-end="563.889">And empty one, and I'm going to set whatever button we're trying to press equal to true.</span> <span data-start="563.889" data-end="569.1">And then I'm going to call the joy pad.set function, and this is actually kind of interesting</span> <span data-start="569.1" data-end="570.1">right here.</span> <span data-start="570.1" data-end="584.66">One of the idiosyncrasies of this is there's only one or two controllers, but I guess because</span> <span data-start="584.66" data-end="590.949">they copy and pasted for the consoles, you still have to give it the button input.</span> <span data-start="590.949" data-end="595.579">So unless you're giving the link input, there's only one player, so player 1 is going to have</span> <span data-start="595.579" data-end="602.559">this input table and I'm going to go down to this infinite loop and we're going to say</span> <span data-start="602.559" data-end="609.089">for each frame of the game I'm going to check to see if there is anything in button.txt,</span> <span data-start="609.089" data-end="622.23">so I'm going to create a variable that is going to read the contents of button.txt and</span> <span data-start="622.23" data-end="626.399">if the button is nil.</span> <span data-start="626.399" data-end="629.22">Press the button, pretty simple, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="629.22" data-end="636.73">So I'm going to put a message out to say I'm pressing the button.</span> <span data-start="636.73" data-end="642.5">As I said, I'm not much of a Lua developer, so Lua string concatenation is just two dots.</span> <span data-start="642.5" data-end="649.16">So if that looked a little funky to you, that's what that is, that is just string concatenation.</span> <span data-start="649.16" data-end="657.49">So I'm going to avoid duplicates like if you send A to the text message thing and then</span> <span data-start="657.49" data-end="660.79">it writes the button to that file, I just want to press the button once, I don't want</span> <span data-start="660.79" data-end="664.829">to keep pressing on each frame repeatedly.</span> <span data-start="664.829" data-end="669.699">Like if you want to press the button twice, you'll.</span> <span data-start="669.699" data-end="675.439">It's going to return nil and button is going to be nil, so this won't be executed, but</span> <span data-start="675.439" data-end="680.139">speaking of pressing buttons for multiple frames, that's another thing I want to address.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="680.139" data-end="683.81">So you are all human beings and when you're playing a video game, you're not playing as</span> <span data-start="683.81" data-end="692.55">fast as machine would, so when you press a button on a Game Boy you're at least holding</span> <span data-start="692.55" data-end="695.449">the button down for a solid portion of a second.</span> <span data-start="695.449" data-end="698.86">So we're going to want to press it for a certain number of frames.</span> <span data-start="698.86" data-end="704.72">Let's say 5.</span> <span data-start="704.72" data-end="711.499">Which is still not a long time, but long enough for it to register and this is the syntax</span> <span data-start="711.499" data-end="715.639">for a foreloop in Lua.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.639" data-end="723.929">But I want to make sure I advance the frame again after each iteration of the loop.</span> <span data-start="723.929" data-end="730.309">So we're done with the talk using a language no one writes, or at I guess some of you do.</span> <span data-start="730.309" data-end="731.309">I guess technically do.</span> <span data-start="731.309" data-end="732.759">Because I'm writing it right now.</span> <span data-start="732.759" data-end="743.189">But first I'm going to reload this Pokémon.lua script.</span> <span data-start="743.189" data-end="748.86">Now I'm going to write the letter A, capital letter A in this text file and if I didn't</span> <span data-start="748.86" data-end="752.74">mess anything up, when I go back to the emulator, it should be pretsing the A button and as</span> <span data-start="752.74" data-end="758.079">you see, it's on this menu screen, so if it works this should go to the screen where I</span> <span data-start="758.079" data-end="762.259">select a new game.</span> <span data-start="762.259" data-end="768.37">Pressing A.  —  I mean I guess it said it was pressing A. Oh, there we go.</span> <span data-start="768.37" data-end="770.379">Maybe five frames wasn't enough, actually.</span> <span data-start="770.379" data-end="771.6">But we'll see.</span> <span data-start="771.6" data-end="774.059">So the Lua code works, that's great.</span> <span data-start="774.059" data-end="779.129">I'm glad to hear that.</span> </p>
