is</span> <span data-start="701.31" data-end="702.93">exactly what I mean when I say that it</span> <span data-start="702.93" data-end="708">should be moldable so a language should</span> <span data-start="708" data-end="710.61">be like a dough you're like massaging it</span> <span data-start="710.61" data-end="713.94">and and making something out of it but</span> <span data-start="713.94" data-end="716.61">it's not predetermined what what that is</span> <span data-start="716.61" data-end="719.64">and that's actually the best part the</span> <span data-start="719.64" data-end="722.78">best part when with a good language is</span> <span data-start="722.78" data-end="725.25">that you don't know what the best part</span> <span data-start="725.25" data-end="728.85">will be because you leave that up to</span> <span data-start="728.85" data-end="731.07">someone else to decide they can use your</span> <span data-start="731.07" data-end="732.78">dough to create something awesome</span> <span data-start="732.78" data-end="735.45">themselves and this is where where the</span> <span data-start="735.45" data-end="737.61">fact comes in that you as a language</span> <span data-start="737.61" data-end="740.76">designer cannot create the perfect like</span> <span data-start="740.76" data-end="742.95">the perfect solution to everything</span> <span data-start="742.95" data-end="744.84">yourself you have to create something</span> <span data-start="744.84" data-end="748.05">that others can change to actually map</span> <span data-start="748.05" data-end="751.92">onto a problem and solve something so</span> <span data-start="751.92" data-end="754.59">now we are wondering this conference is</span> <span data-start="754.59" data-end="756.33">about JavaScript who brought this guy</span> <span data-start="756.33" data-end="759.89">here what is he talking about and</span> <span data-start="759.89" data-end="765.06">there's there's three reasons why I</span> <span data-start="765.06" data-end="766.85">think that these questions are</span> <span data-start="766.85" data-end="769.64">interesting when it comes to JavaScript</span> <span data-start="769.64" data-end="771.93">when you try to like think of a new</span> <span data-start="771.93" data-end="774.24">language think of what you would like to</span> <span data-start="774.24" data-end="781.16">do and the first one is regarding like</span> <span data-start="781.16" data-end="784.5">what's what the language does and what</span> <span data-start="784.5" data-end="787.02">it should do what it shouldn't do and I</span> <span data-start="787.02" data-end="789.33">mean javascript is just so full of</span> <span data-start="789.33" data-end="792.06">so there's so many bad</span> <span data-start="792.06" data-end="793.68">balls like don't do this don't do this</span> <span data-start="793.68" data-end="795.87">don't do this don't do this very very</span> <span data-start="795.87" data-end="799.47">much to learn from and secondly and this</span> <span data-start="799.47" data-end="801.35">might be the most important point is</span> <span data-start="801.35" data-end="804.81">that currently it's like a platform for</span> <span data-start="804.81" data-end="807">everything and now i'm using everything</span> <span data-start="807" data-end="808.53">in the same sloppy sense that everyone</span> <span data-start="808.53" data-end="810.45">else is using everything because it's</span> <span data-start="810.45" data-end="812.52">not a platform for everything but when</span> <span data-start="812.52" data-end="815.4">you're doing web these days you have to</span> <span data-start="815.4" data-end="817.11">work with javascript because javascript</span> <span data-start="817.11" data-end="818.49">is known the language the runs in the</span> <span data-start="818.49" data-end="821.22">browser and more and more things come to</span> <span data-start="821.22" data-end="823.8">the world of the browser these days so</span> <span data-start="823.8" data-end="827.25">if you want to make a new language that</span> <span data-start="827.25" data-end="829.08">targets the browser you will have to</span> <span data-start="829.08" data-end="831.45">think of javascript how will this new</span> <span data-start="831.45" data-end="834.72">language play with javascript how can we</span> <span data-start="834.72" data-end="836.76">make them interact with each other in</span> <span data-start="836.76" data-end="838.83">order to reuse all that's already out</span> <span data-start="838.83" data-end="843.3">there and third javascript actually has</span> <span data-start="843.3" data-end="845.64">some amazing ideas it contains a lot of</span> <span data-start="845.64" data-end="849.81">good good stuff like functions are first</span> <span data-start="849.81" data-end="854.25">class objects behave like caches or hash</span> <span data-start="854.25" data-end="856.98">maps you can look up all the properties</span> <span data-start="856.98" data-end="859.2">and functions and everything like a hash</span> <span data-start="859.2" data-end="864.12">and it's very tiny in general it's not a</span> <span data-start="864.12" data-end="867.42">big bloated language and the prototyping</span> <span data-start="867.42" data-end="871.26">is at least to me a more pure idea of</span> <span data-start="871.26" data-end="873.33">inheritance than the classical model</span> <span data-start="873.33" data-end="876.54">employed by Java or C++ because you can</span> <span data-start="876.54" data-end="878.28">build something that behaves kind of</span> <span data-start="878.28" data-end="880.49">like classical inheritance using</span> <span data-start="880.49" data-end="884.63">prototyping but you can simplify the</span> <span data-start="884.63" data-end="886.94">classical model if that's what you have</span> <span data-start="886.94" data-end="891.09">so it has a lot of good ideas and I</span> <span data-start="891.09" data-end="893.37">think that will play well with a new</span> <span data-start="893.37" data-end="895.8">language that could create that embodies</span> <span data-start="895.8" data-end="898.41">these new ideas and and the new things</span> <span data-start="898.41" data-end="900.96">that I'm thinking of the primitives that</span> <span data-start="900.96" data-end="903.06">you would really want in a language to</span> <span data-start="903.06" data-end="905.67">make it really really dynamic really</span> <span data-start="905.67" data-end="909.78">moldable are those are three things as</span> <span data-start="909.78" data-end="912.87">well and the first one of those is to</span> <span data-start="912.87" data-end="915.99">have called by name instead of call by</span> <span data-start="915.99" data-end="919.83">value all or call by reference and if</span> <span data-start="919.83" data-end="921.63">not all of you understand what that</span> <span data-start="921.63" data-end="925.12">means it's passing a value to offer</span> <span data-start="925.12" data-end="928.06">like a copy of the original value that's</span> <span data-start="928.06" data-end="929.65">called by value called by reference</span> <span data-start="929.65" data-end="931.51">means that you pass a reference to the</span> <span data-start="931.51" data-end="933.94">original object and call by name means</span> <span data-start="933.94" data-end="937.6">that you pass the actual name of what</span> <span data-start="937.6" data-end="940.29">you're sending in the symbol or the</span> <span data-start="940.29" data-end="944.74">expression itself which allows you to do</span> <span data-start="944.74" data-end="946.87">things that don't evaluate immediately</span> <span data-start="946.87" data-end="950.29">but for example think of this like tank</span> <span data-start="950.29" data-end="955.12">of severed do kodesh JavaScript the code</span> <span data-start="955.12" data-end="959.11">where we have a lazy function which</span> <span data-start="959.11" data-end="961.12">doesn't evaluate its arguments when they</span> <span data-start="961.12" data-end="963.52">are first passed in but rather can use</span> <span data-start="963.52" data-end="966.07">some kind of executes statement to to</span> <span data-start="966.07" data-end="968.98">actually evaluate those if we had that</span> <span data-start="968.98" data-end="972.48">and well if we had could could assign</span> <span data-start="972.48" data-end="974.98">values to operators we could implement</span> <span data-start="974.98" data-end="977.589">the end operator ourselves because we</span> <span data-start="977.589" data-end="980.98">would not have to evaluate be if a is</span> <span data-start="980.98" data-end="985.18">false and the cool thing is that if you</span> <span data-start="985.18" data-end="986.41">have this functionality you can</span> <span data-start="986.41" data-end="988.75">implement the regular one because if you</span> <span data-start="988.75" data-end="990.52">just take all the arguments and start by</span> <span data-start="990.52" data-end="992.709">evaluating them left to right you get</span> <span data-start="992.709" data-end="995.2">the regular function behavior like the</span> <span data-start="995.2" data-end="997.18">everything is evaluated before the</span> <span data-start="997.18" data-end="998.98">function starts so this is a more</span> <span data-start="998.98" data-end="1001.38">generic primitive to construct your</span> <span data-start="1001.38" data-end="1007.279">language from secondly we need operators</span> <span data-start="1007.279" data-end="1010.65">and I don't just mean having operators</span> <span data-start="1010.65" data-end="1012.45">like in JavaScript I mean operators on</span> <span data-start="1012.45" data-end="1015.209">freaking steroids so so they can do</span> <span data-start="1015.209" data-end="1018">anything you want we're not anything but</span> <span data-start="1018" data-end="1022.43">more things and i took this example from</span> <span data-start="1022.43" data-end="1025.679">from well Ruby or coffee script or other</span> <span data-start="1025.679" data-end="1030.589">languages has the the unless statement</span> <span data-start="1030.589" data-end="1032.79">maybe you used coffee script and and</span> <span data-start="1032.79" data-end="1035.22">seen this what it means is that we will</span> <span data-start="1035.22" data-end="1040.02">assign V to be a plus B unless X is</span> <span data-start="1040.02" data-end="1044.37">larger than y so that's kind of an</span> <span data-start="1044.37" data-end="1047.04">operator a lazy one again it evaluates</span> <span data-start="1047.04" data-end="1049.62">the right part first and then it runs</span> <span data-start="1049.62" data-end="1052.35">the left part if depending on the</span> <span data-start="1052.35" data-end="1056.61">truthiness some of the right part and in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1056.61" data-end="1058">CoffeeScript this has</span> <span data-start="1058" data-end="1061.48">has been like a put into the language</span> <span data-start="1061.48" data-end="1064.06">they have entered the unless statement</span> <span data-start="1064.06" data-end="1066.09">into the grammar of the language itself</span> <span data-start="1066.09" data-end="1069.16">which is exactly the wrong way to do it</span> <span data-start="1069.16" data-end="1071.86">in my opinion if you really want an</span> <span data-start="1071.86" data-end="1073.54">unless statement and you have to create</span> <span data-start="1073.54" data-end="1076.45">a new language to get it what does that</span> <span data-start="1076.45" data-end="1079.24">tell you then you're not really solving</span> <span data-start="1079.24" data-end="1081.55">the problem by doing what CoffeeScript</span> <span data-start="1081.55" data-end="1083.98">does you're just saying I have a better</span> <span data-start="1083.98" data-end="1085.72">idea I will provide the people with this</span> <span data-start="1085.72" data-end="1087.25">solution and they can use that instead</span> <span data-start="1087.25" data-end="1089.77">and if that idea is not awesome or</span> <span data-start="1089.77" data-end="1091.72">someone else has a good idea well then</span> <span data-start="1091.72" data-end="1093.1">you're screwed again you haven't solved</span> <span data-start="1093.1" data-end="1097.81">the actual issue so what I would like to</span> <span data-start="1097.81" data-end="1100.78">do instead is to be able to say that at</span> <span data-start="1100.78" data-end="1104.65">runtime like I want the word unless to</span> <span data-start="1104.65" data-end="1107.23">behave like an operator and I wanted to</span> <span data-start="1107.23" data-end="1109.78">evaluate either the left or the right</span> <span data-start="1109.78" data-end="1112.39">side first and I wanted to have this and</span> <span data-start="1112.39" data-end="1114.7">these proceedings so it gets executed</span> <span data-start="1114.7" data-end="1117.25">before or after other operators as I</span> <span data-start="1117.25" data-end="1120.94">want to so it when it's actually run</span> <span data-start="1120.94" data-end="1123.61">turns into something that looks more</span> <span data-start="1123.61" data-end="1127.96">like this not actual code again but just</span> <span data-start="1127.96" data-end="1130.45">so you can think of what it does so</span> <span data-start="1130.45" data-end="1134.31">unless would then be a method on the</span> <span data-start="1134.31" data-end="1138.49">boolean type so as long as you define</span> <span data-start="1138.49" data-end="1143.05">unless as an operator and you create a</span> <span data-start="1143.05" data-end="1145.69">function that's called unless it will be</span> <span data-start="1145.69" data-end="1149.29">invoked well like this if everything</span> <span data-start="1149.29" data-end="1153.63">works the way you you intended it to</span> <span data-start="1153.63" data-end="1159.47">sorry</span> <span data-start="1159.48" data-end="1163.21">so that's exactly one can you hear me</span> <span data-start="1163.21" data-end="1178.519">well none is it good it's okay thank you</span> <span data-start="1178.529" data-end="1182.649">so this is the thing you have to find</span> <span data-start="1182.649" data-end="1185.47">the primitives that will allow you to</span> <span data-start="1185.47" data-end="1188.71">create the new features that you want by</span> <span data-start="1188.71" data-end="1190.419">not creating a new programming language</span> <span data-start="1190.419" data-end="1192.809">but bending the one you have into new</span> <span data-start="1192.809" data-end="1197.649">into a new shape so that was called by</span> <span data-start="1197.649" data-end="1200.619">name and it was operators the third one</span> <span data-start="1200.619" data-end="1204.82">is syntax unification which is what</span> <span data-start="1204.82" data-end="1207.46">leads make sense at this is this is like</span> <span data-start="1207.46" data-end="1209.95">the whole thing that is list everything</span> <span data-start="1209.95" data-end="1212.23">looks the same you have your parentheses</span> <span data-start="1212.23" data-end="1213.639">and that's it then you can play with</span> <span data-start="1213.639" data-end="1215.95">them the bad part about this place that</span> <span data-start="1215.95" data-end="1217.69">you have to play with the parentheses</span> <span data-start="1217.69" data-end="1220.69">you can't add operators you can't make</span> <span data-start="1220.69" data-end="1223.389">things that read better than a whole</span> <span data-start="1223.389" data-end="1226.389">bunch of parentheses and well just lots</span> <span data-start="1226.389" data-end="1229.899">of nested statement but we still need</span> <span data-start="1229.899" data-end="1233.139">that part as well because then we would</span> <span data-start="1233.139" data-end="1235.69">be we would have the possibility to</span> <span data-start="1235.69" data-end="1237.85">actually implement something that looked</span> <span data-start="1237.85" data-end="1240.429">like this that I showed you in the first</span> <span data-start="1240.429" data-end="1244.809">code example if filter would be a</span> <span data-start="1244.809" data-end="1248.35">function that was taking its arguments</span> <span data-start="1248.35" data-end="1250.629">in the lazy way and not just evaluating</span> <span data-start="1250.629" data-end="1253.24">them right away this would be okay to</span> <span data-start="1253.24" data-end="1255.399">begin with because it wouldn't evaluate</span> <span data-start="1255.399" data-end="1257.2">the arguments and argument this kind of</span> <span data-start="1257.2" data-end="1260.289">invalid so it's not okay to to evaluate</span> <span data-start="1260.289" data-end="1263.529">it but when it passes it to the to the</span> <span data-start="1263.529" data-end="1266.619">function it should not just pass like</span> <span data-start="1266.619" data-end="1271.21">this dream greater than zero it should</span> <span data-start="1271.21" data-end="1274.779">parse that as if it were a program which</span> <span data-start="1274.779" data-end="1276.879">we want it to be and create something</span> <span data-start="1276.879" data-end="1279.07">like this like this is a message and it</span> <span data-start="1279.07" data-end="1280.419">has a name and it has a list of</span> <span data-start="1280.419" data-end="1283.389">arguments and the arguments could be new</span> <span data-start="1283.389" data-end="1285.1">messages doing new things it could be a</span> <span data-start="1285.1" data-end="1286.87">whole freaking program in there</span> <span data-start="1286.87" data-end="1289.18">and then you pass that to the function</span> <span data-start="1289.18" data-end="1292.48">and instead of saying like execute</span> <span data-start="1292.48" data-end="1295.45">evaluate this statement or this</span> <span data-start="1295.45" data-end="1300.61">expression you you send the expression</span> <span data-start="1300.61" data-end="1304.75">to an object so here we're we're</span> <span data-start="1304.75"

data-end="1338.62">is parsed to to a syntax tree like like</span> <span data-start="1338.62" data-end="1343.09">this or something like it and not just</span> <span data-start="1343.09" data-end="1345.64">looked upon as a piece of like like a</span> <span data-start="1345.64" data-end="1347.89">string which we have in JavaScript with</span> <span data-start="1347.89" data-end="1349.66">the eval statement we can pass a string</span> <span data-start="1349.66" data-end="1351.88">to it and we can evaluate arbitrary code</span> <span data-start="1351.88" data-end="1355.3">but if we actually parsed it and got the</span> <span data-start="1355.3" data-end="1357.73">data as it looked we could manipulate it</span> <span data-start="1357.73" data-end="1360.55">in more more meaningful ways and we</span> <span data-start="1360.55" data-end="1362.74">could change things a lot in here we</span> <span data-start="1362.74" data-end="1365.5">could not just send the message to a</span> <span data-start="1365.5" data-end="1367.179">target object but we could manipulate</span> <span data-start="1367.179" data-end="1369.82">the message first we could change the</span> <span data-start="1369.82" data-end="1372.85">zero in in the argument to something</span> <span data-start="1372.85" data-end="1375.67">else or we could could reshape it in</span> <span data-start="1375.67" data-end="1378.22">some other way and and as you see I I</span> <span data-start="1378.22" data-end="1379.78">don't really know what we could use it</span> <span data-start="1379.78" data-end="1382.63">for but that's the point it gives you</span> <span data-start="1382.63" data-end="1385.24">power to do things and it gives you the</span> <span data-start="1385.24" data-end="1387.85">power to make up what you should use it</span> <span data-start="1387.85" data-end="1389.89">for it it's not my job to say what what</span> <span data-start="1389.89" data-end="1394.179">you should do with it so that's the</span> <span data-start="1394.179" data-end="1398.22">third point so to start like wrapping up</span> <span data-start="1398.22" data-end="1400.6">we're not really there yet we're not</span> <span data-start="1400.6" data-end="1403.42">using the full potential of dynamic</span> <span data-start="1403.42" data-end="1406.33">languages we are just like scratching</span> <span data-start="1406.33" data-end="1409.559">the surface and I think the reason is</span> <span data-start="1409.559" data-end="1412.54">most of the languages we use today were</span> <span data-start="1412.54" data-end="1415.75">developed quite a long time ago like</span> <span data-start="1415.75" data-end="1419.29">javascript is like 16 years old now ruby</span> <span data-start="1419.29" data-end="1420.55">was created in the beginning</span> <span data-start="1420.55" data-end="1424.69">the 90s JavaScript as Java as well even</span> <span data-start="1424.69" data-end="1426.81">if it's not one of the dynamic languages</span> <span data-start="1426.81" data-end="1431.62">and that age put certain restrictions on</span> <span data-start="1431.62" data-end="1434.41">the performance people thought that well</span> <span data-start="1434.41" data-end="1438.82">it has to at least be kind of fast but</span> <span data-start="1438.82" data-end="1440.95">we know now that there's room for</span> <span data-start="1440.95" data-end="1443.22">different languages there's room for</span> <span data-start="1443.22" data-end="1446.68">four options I mean everything we use</span> <span data-start="1446.68" data-end="1448.78">don't have to be performant all the time</span> <span data-start="1448.78" data-end="1451.99">if it would had have to we would still</span> <span data-start="1451.99" data-end="1457.02">be using assembler so when people say</span> <span data-start="1457.02" data-end="1460.12">well what about safety and and what</span> <span data-start="1460.12" data-end="1464.31">about performance I just say well safety</span> <span data-start="1464.31" data-end="1468.04">go back to using Java come on if you</span> <span data-start="1468.04" data-end="1469.42">don't want to shoot yourself in the foot</span> <span data-start="1469.42" data-end="1470.98">you shouldn't even be using javascript</span> <span data-start="1470.98" data-end="1475.63">to to begin with the same thing applies</span> <span data-start="1475.63" data-end="1478.75">here if you want safety you create it</span> <span data-start="1478.75" data-end="1481.09">yourself you write tests you follow</span> <span data-start="1481.09" data-end="1484.12">conventions you learn from other you</span> <span data-start="1484.12" data-end="1487.15">avoid the Troublesome parts of the</span> <span data-start="1487.15" data-end="1490.96">language and so on if safety is what you</span> <span data-start="1490.96" data-end="1494.44">want don't use our dynamic language and</span> <span data-start="1494.44" data-end="1496.6">if you use a dynamic language stop</span> <span data-start="1496.6" data-end="1499.06">caring about safety don't say it's not</span> <span data-start="1499.06" data-end="1500.65">safe if you can manipulate everything</span> <span data-start="1500.65" data-end="1501.97">and change everything and no one</span> <span data-start="1501.97" data-end="1504.76">understands what you're doing that's</span> <span data-start="1504.76" data-end="1507.25">just not valid and then as for the</span> <span data-start="1507.25" data-end="1510.82">performance like I said performance it's</span> <span data-start="1510.82" data-end="1513.25">just a matter of time you can't really</span> <span data-start="1513.25" data-end="1517.24">you it's going to be optimized over time</span> <span data-start="1517.24" data-end="1521.26">compilers become better our Hardware</span> <span data-start="1521.26" data-end="1524.53">becomes better we're always taking new</span> <span data-start="1524.53" data-end="1526.66">steps so we would still be doing like</span> <span data-start="1526.66" data-end="1529.75">assembler or see if if we never thought</span> <span data-start="1529.75" data-end="1536.62">about new languages so once again don't</span> <span data-start="1536.62" data-end="1540.58">ask yourself what your language can do</span> <span data-start="1540.58" data-end="1542.74">for current language or your ideal</span> <span data-start="1542.74" data-end="1545.05">language ask yourself what is it that I</span> <span data-start="1545.05" data-end="1549.16">can't do what what would happen if I</span> <span data-start="1549.16" data-end="1552.49">could do those things because let's face</span> <span data-start="1552.49" data-end="1554.53">it every program</span> <span data-start="1554.53" data-end="1557.14">language today is turing-complete they</span> <span data-start="1557.14" data-end="1559.57">can all solve the exact same set of</span> <span data-start="1559.57" data-end="1563.38">problems except changing themselves only</span> <span data-start="1563.38" data-end="1566.02">a truly dynamic programming language can</span> <span data-start="1566.02" data-end="1577.269">do that Thank</span> <span data-start="1577.279" data-end="1581.519">two things if you're interested in</span> <span data-start="1581.519" data-end="1584.459">seeing what what's becoming of these</span> <span

<p><span data-start="1593.219" data-end="1595.799">I would love to answer all of your</span> <span data-start="1595.799" data-end="1599.129">questions but I think it's much more</span> <span data-start="1599.129" data-end="1601.859">interesting to take while and discuss it</span> <span data-start="1601.859" data-end="1605.099">so just come up to me after this and ask</span> <span data-start="1605.099" data-end="1606.659">anything you want and we'll talk about</span> <span data-start="1606.659" data-end="1610.709">it and all of you can do it if you want</span> </p>
