<p><span data-start="69.84" data-end="74.25">HTML slides for the win so this is I</span> <span data-start="74.25" data-end="77.31">think some sass or s CSS specifically</span> <span data-start="77.31" data-end="81.049">and it's kind of like a fairly</span> <span data-start="81.049" data-end="83.82">declarative syntax so what is there to</span> <span data-start="83.82" data-end="86.52">hack what is there to abuse with just</span> <span data-start="86.52" data-end="89.01">some text that turns into CSS right so</span> <span data-start="89.01" data-end="91.17">it's not necessarily an obvious

<span data-start="117.18" data-end="119.76">into actual CSS right so how do we take</span> <span data-start="119.76" data-end="121.95">that variable pull it out and then put</span> <span

data-end="131.76">does parsing work so let's narrow it</span> <span data-start="131.76" data-end="133.739">down even further we just have a single</span> <span data-start="133.739" data-end="137.37">variable declaration in sass and</span> <span data-start="137.37" data-end="141.72">naturally sass is Ruby and I don't</span> <span data-start="141.72" data-end="143.76">really

talk about it on</span> <span data-start="150.689" data-end="152.579">a high level here and that's just like</span> <span data-start="152.579" data-end="153.28">no</span> <span data-start="153.28" data-end="155.62">the syntax rules of the language and go</span> <span data-start="155.62" data-end="158.11">through and assign what everything is</span> <span data-start="158.11" data-end="160.569">this is a variable declaration or this</span> <span data-start="160.569" data-end="163.39">is a even more specifically a string or</span> <span data-start="163.39" data-end="166.54">a value or a semicolon right figure out</span> <span data-start="166.54" data-end="169.54">all those different parts so inside this</span> <span data-start="169.54" data-end="171.37">little little guy we have the the</span> <span data-start="171.37" data-end="172.78">variable prefix we can look for the</span> <span data-start="172.78" data-end="175.209">dollar sign and we know that hey this is</span> <span data-start="175.209" data-end="177.069">about to be a variable we know it's</span> <span data-start="177.069" data-end="178.63">gonna be a variable until we hit like</span> <span data-start="178.63" data-end="180.97">white space or a semicolon and in this</span> <span data-start="180.97" data-end="182.83">case we get the variable name it's blue</span> <span data-start="182.83" data-end="184.9">and then we get a semicolon then we can</span> <span data-start="184.9" data-end="187.18">have as much white space as we want and</span> <span data-start="187.18" data-end="188.8">then we get some random string and</span> <span data-start="188.8" data-end="191.5">that's gonna be the value most of the</span> <span data-start="191.5" data-end="193.959">time CSS will let you put anything in</span> <span data-start="193.959" data-end="196.3">there as long as it's not like the</span> <span data-start="196.3" data-end="198.1">semicolon or another colon or something</span> <span data-start="198.1" data-end="201.28">like that so any non invalid character</span> <span data-start="201.28" data-end="203.2">there it's going to be the value so it</span> <span data-start="203.2" data-end="204.61">might not actually be anything to the</span> <span data-start="204.61" data-end="207.75">browser but it would be valid and then</span> <span data-start="207.75" data-end="211.6">obviously the the rule delimiter so this</span> <span data-start="211.6" data-end="214.06">is how this would parse down whenever</span> <span data-start="214.06" data-end="218.14">sass was was pulling this in more</span> <span data-start="218.14" data-end="220.15">specifically it does that</span> <span data-start="220.15" data-end="221.86">programmatically so it's going to go</span> <span data-start="221.86" data-end="224.35">through and check every possibility of</span> <span data-start="224.35" data-end="227.019">each thing of each character that it</span> <span data-start="227.019" data-end="229.48">gets to and so this is the the most</span> <span data-start="229.48" data-end="231.4">simple parser that I could write on a</span> <span data-start="231.4" data-end="235.54">single slide you have a result array and</span> <span data-start="235.54" data-end="238.239">you just want to push each token on to</span> <span data-start="238.239" data-end="241.63">the array so you say I hit a semicolon</span> <span data-start="241.63" data-end="243.88">push the semicolon token which in this</span> <span data-start="243.88" data-end="245.739">case is the string semicolon probably</span> <span data-start="245.739" data-end="249.16">would not work out well but you go</span> <span data-start="249.16" data-end="251.049">through and then you you end up with a</span> <span data-start="251.049" data-end="253.03">list of each of the tokens so rather</span> <span data-start="253.03" data-end="255.22">than having just random text strings you</span> <span data-start="255.22" data-end="257.47">know like hey this is a variable this is</span> <span data-start="257.47" data-end="259.959">a rule delimiter this is a value and</span> <span data-start="259.959" data-end="264.55">this is a rule ending statement more</span> <span data-start="264.55" data-end="266.169">realistically most people are going to</span> <span data-start="266.169" data-end="269.86">write a parser expression generator a</span> <span data-start="269.86" data-end="273.16">peg a parser expression generator is is</span> <span data-start="273.16" data-end="274.66">what this is and you don't have to know</span> <span data-start="274.66" data-end="275.919">anything about this I just wanted to</span> <span data-start="275.919" data-end="279.1">make sure I was being realistic you kind</span> <span data-start="279.1" data-end="280.87">of define that like hey a class is a dot</span> <span data-start="280.87" data-end="283.15">followed by an identifier and then</span> <span data-start="283.15" data-end="284.86">whenever I get this just give me this</span> <span data-start="284.86" data-end="286">object back and then</span> <span data-start="286" data-end="288.19">a computer will generate a parser for</span> <span data-start="288.19" data-end="289.51">you so you don't have to write all those</span> <span data-start="289.51" data-end="291.82">like reverse while loops and do a look</span> <span data-start="291.82" data-end="293.05">ahead and all that stuff</span> <span data-start="293.05" data-end="296.38">so if you are looking into writing your</span> <span data-start="296.38" data-end="298.54">own parser I probably suggest starting</span> <span data-start="298.54" data-end="300.55">at a parser expression generator so you</span> <span data-start="300.55" data-end="304.48">just write the grammar and it generates</span> <span data-start="304.48" data-end="308.26">the parser much more simple so when</span> <span data-start="308.26" data-end="309.46">you're done you need to represent the</span> <span data-start="309.46" data-end="311.83">code as data instead of pure text so now</span> <span data-start="311.83" data-end="313.45">we have somewhere in between there we</span> <span data-start="313.45" data-end="315.49">have like here what all of our symbols</span> <span data-start="315.49" data-end="319.75">are we have tokens if you will so so</span> <span data-start="319.75" data-end="322.09">this first becomes this so we have the</span> <span data-start="322.09" data-end="323.74">the variable start which is that dollar</span> <span data-start="323.74" data-end="326.13">sign we have a string which is blue</span> <span data-start="326.13" data-end="328.45">that's technically like the variable</span> <span data-start="328.45" data-end="330.13">name and then we have like the equals</span> <span data-start="330.13" data-end="335.28">operator which in CSS is the colon the</span> <span data-start="335.28" data-end="337.96">string is is the value that we have</span> <span data-start="337.96" data-end="341.02">there and then we have a rule end a rule</span> <span data-start="341.02" data-end="343.56">ender Enders game coming up soon a</span> <span data-start="343.56" data-end="349.93">sponsor but we add structure so if you</span> <span data-start="349.93" data-end="353.44">go back here you can see that it's it's</span> <span data-start="353.44" data-end="355.479">a very small CSS file it actually would</span> <span data-start="355.479" data-end="359.62">output nothing on on the other end but</span> <span data-start="359.62" data-end="360.97">we have that and we turn it into this we</span> <span data-start="360.97" data-end="363.79">say this is a single node and inside of</span> <span data-start="363.79" data-end="366.52">it has two nodes inside of it and that</span> <span data-start="366.52" data-end="370.3">is of our name and a value and so now we</span> <span data-start="370.3" data-end="373.479">have this this idea of this is a single</span> <span data-start="373.479" data-end="375.479">node and inside of our two smaller nodes</span> <span data-start="375.479" data-end="378.4">and the way the entire CSS file is going</span> <span data-start="378.4" data-end="380.71">to parse out is into these leaf nodes or</span> <span data-start="380.71" data-end="381.94">write like this so you'll always have</span> <span data-start="381.94" data-end="384.88">like a variable name or a CSS value or a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.88" data-end="388.18">CSS property and you can go deep into</span> <span data-start="388.18" data-end="390.55">your your tree which we'll talk about in</span> <span data-start="390.55" data-end="393.16">a second and everything reduces down</span> <span data-start="393.16" data-end="396.07">into these very simple things they're</span> <span data-start="396.07" data-end="399.4">just put all in a list together or in a</span> <span data-start="399.4" data-end="401.229">tree together depending on how deep you</span> <span data-start="401.229" data-end="404.62">go CSS is actually not very deep sass</span> <span data-start="404.62" data-end="407.05">and compass and all that stuff they</span> <span data-start="407.05" data-end="408.46">actually allow you to nest a lot further</span> <span data-start="408.46" data-end="410.07">and so when you're parsing</span> <span data-start="410.07" data-end="412.51">pre-processors you you actually do see</span> <span data-start="412.51" data-end="414.729">like larger nesting and so you have a</span> </p>
