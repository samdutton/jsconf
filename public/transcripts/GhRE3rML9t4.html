<p><span data-start="24.32" data-end="30.76">This is like writing CSS 15 years ago, where we didn't have the technology we have today,</span> <span data-start="30.76" data-end="35.55">we have custom properties, there is so much at our hands, and it makes writing styles</span> <span data-start="35.55" data-end="38.15">for the web such a joy.</span> <span data-start="38.15" data-end="43.72">CSS still has its downfalls and challenges, right?</span> <span data-start="43.72" data-end="45.51">Let's talk about form styling.</span> <span data-start="45.51" data-end="46.51">Why?</span> <span data-start="46.51" data-end="51.04">Why can't we style forms in 2019?</span> <span data-start="51.04" data-end="59.56">If you're familiar with W3 schools, an education site that shows you basic ways to write web</span> <span data-start="59.56" data-end="64.33">for the code, and so I saw this custom dropdown there and I thought, ""Oh, cool.""</span> <span data-start="64.33" data-end="71.79">The steps we've got is we've got HTML, we are adding CSS — fine — there's like some</span> <span data-start="71.79" data-end="79.56">studio elements there, and then I scroll down and it's [sound problem].</span> <span data-start="79.56" data-end="86">Still today, it's frustrating because I like to separate my logic and my styling.</span> <span data-start="86" data-end="88.25">You can't do it on the web.</span> <span data-start="88.25" data-end="93.31">We can make gradients on the web, and they're cool, dynamic, you can create a comma-separated</span> <span data-start="93.31" data-end="97.1">list of values — live on page — you can adjust these things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="97.1" data-end="98.65">You can layer them.</span> <span data-start="98.65" data-end="105.14">So it becomes this really great tool when you're creating filter effects on images.</span> <span data-start="105.14" data-end="108.759">I using this on the web.</span> <span data-start="108.759" data-end="114.5">You can't read .. gradients yet.</span> <span data-start="114.5" data-end="118.22">The top point, they go round the centre and to to that point.</span> <span data-start="118.22" data-end="125.04">If we wanted to create .. if we wanted to create a continuous gradient we would create</span> <span data-start="125.04" data-end="129.09">the colour for the first and last value and create it there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.09" data-end="137.049">If we look at ""can I use"", we can see that the gradients are not well stored, so we can't</span> <span data-start="137.049" data-end="140.09">use those on the web.</span> <span data-start="140.09" data-end="144.18">Gradients are something that doesn't currently exist in CSS.</span> <span data-start="144.18" data-end="148.709">Right here, I have an example where I have a div, and, when I hover it, I'm converting</span> <span data-start="148.709" data-end="150.42">from red to blue.</span> <span data-start="150.42" data-end="152.17">So that is what I'm trying to do inside this gradient.</span> <span data-start="152.17" data-end="157.18">I'm setting it to go to right and from red to blue, and then transferring to deep pink.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="157.18" data-end="162.73">When I hover on this gradient, this div, it's not able to transition that value, and we</span> <span data-start="162.73" data-end="164.379">will get into it a little bit later.</span> <span data-start="164.379" data-end="166.7">Not able to do it on the web.</span> <span data-start="166.7" data-end="169.65">Custom borders are something that you can kind of on the web.</span> <span data-start="169.65" data-end="174.139">We have a border digital property which is cool but it's limited.</span> <span data-start="174.139" data-end="178.569">If you wanted to do something like a corner shape which would mask your image as well</span> <span data-start="178.569" data-end="183.969">as apply a border shape on that element, this is not something that you can do, and this</span> <span data-start="183.969" data-end="192.279">is 200013 spec who tried to push this forward and it never really got into browsers — sad.</span> <span data-start="192.279" data-end="209.48">But  there's Houdini?</span> <span data-start="209.48" data-end="213.079">If you haven't heard of Houdini, it's really, really cool.</span> <span data-start="213.079" data-end="218.309">It's basically a low-level API-for-CSS, and more accurately, it's a series of APIs that</span> <span data-start="218.309" data-end="223.549">give developers access to the CSS object model, and it allows us to tell the browser how we</span> <span data-start="223.549" data-end="225.65">want it to read our CSS code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.65" data-end="228.01">So, this is kind of what happens now?</span> <span data-start="228.01" data-end="232.77">If you want to style something on the web that doesn't currently exist as a CSS property</span> <span data-start="232.77" data-end="237.819">and value pair that you can write in CSS, you have to write a JavaScript polyfill for</span> <span data-start="237.819" data-end="238.819">it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="238.819" data-end="246.029">So, your browser goes through this parser set and reads the DOM and the CSS object model,</span> <span data-start="246.029" data-end="248.979">and then you have to do that all over again with the JavaScript polyfill because you're</span> <span data-start="248.979" data-end="252.43">reapplying the styles to the page after it's already loaded ones.</span> <span data-start="252.43" data-end="260.09">But with Houdini we can apply the styles directly to the CSS, so we have so much power as developers</span> <span data-start="260.09" data-end="265.509">now, because we can tell the browser at that CSS step what it should be doing when it is</span> <span data-start="265.509" data-end="267.229">reading our code.</span> <span data-start="267.229" data-end="268.59">Exciting.</span> <span data-start="268.59" data-end="273.919">So while it takes a while for specs to get implemented in browsers, that is like this</span> <span data-start="273.919" data-end="277.73">big dog here taking its time, that's a good thing, we don't want the browser to implement</span> <span data-start="277.73" data-end="278.8">anything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.8" data-end="283.259">If you wanted a feature that doesn't currently exist, you can be like this pupper zooming</span> <span data-start="283.259" data-end="289.83">by creating your own tech, CSS polyfills, creating JavaScript to do it, and it exists</span> <span data-start="289.83" data-end="290.889">in the browser.</span> <span data-start="290.889" data-end="291.889">Pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="291.889" data-end="299.331">The best resource for this right now is Houdini ready yet — we have all the browsers agreed</span> <span data-start="299.331" data-end="304.94">that implement the spec, as well as the W3 specs you can go and read.</span> <span data-start="304.94" data-end="309.139">The state of ""can I use?</span> <span data-start="309.139" data-end="312.24">"" For Houdini.</span> <span data-start="312.24" data-end="314.62">It's very much a work in progress.</span> <span data-start="314.62" data-end="320.71">The most supported APIs are the paint API and the typed object model, and so because</span> <span data-start="320.71" data-end="324.009">we have limited time, that's what we are going to focus on here today.</span> <span data-start="324.009" data-end="326.78">So let's start with the typed object model.</span> <span data-start="326.78" data-end="332.319">The typed object model allows us to have more semantic CSS parsing.</span> <span data-start="332.319" data-end="334.189">What does that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.189" data-end="341.659">Right now, it has to go through the whole string-based Regex parsing, and that is slow,</span> <span data-start="341.659" data-end="348.18">it's looking for an ID, property, class, or a specific key word in that string which is</span> <span data-start="348.18" data-end="354.699">like the dot here, and the string from that dot until that open curly brace, then looking</span> <span data-start="354.699" data-end="361.509">for a property value, a colon, a value, a unit, a semicolon, making sure those are accurate</span> <span data-start="361.509" data-end="364.08">values and they work properly.</span> <span data-start="364.08" data-end="369.59">This can get really messy really fast, and it's just so much slower than having some</span> <span data-start="369.59" data-end="380.59">structured data, so the typed object model supplies that structured model.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="380.59" data-end="386.319">I get a value like height and we return a CSS unit value which is this object that returns</span> <span data-start="386.319" data-end="391.8">a value and a unit, so this is a lot more semantic and so therefore it makes it faster</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="393.34">to read through that CSS.</span> <span data-start="393.34" data-end="398.009">And so here I'm doing this, I have a box, it has width and height.</span> <span data-start="398.009" data-end="403.74">We can get properties from computer style-out and you can set properties, so do attributes,</span> <span data-start="403.74" data-end="409.889">property, and then I could specify css.number giving it a type, and then it's going to update</span> <span data-start="409.889" data-end="414.199">and a that, and, when we do that again, we see we're getting our parsing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="414.199" data-end="419.84">If you look at this in DevTools, you will get the CSS unit value object where you have</span> <span data-start="419.84" data-end="423.56">that unit and value separated out.</span> <span data-start="423.56" data-end="431.96">That leads me to the property and the values API.</span> <span data-start="431.96" data-end="435.249">Have any of you used custom properties right now?</span> <span data-start="435.249" data-end="438.37">That's 30 per cent of you.</span> <span data-start="438.37" data-end="444.259">Custom properties are really great because they're actual dynamic CSS variables that</span> <span data-start="444.259" data-end="445.979">we have not browser.</span> <span data-start="445.979" data-end="450.49">Unlike Sass where you have a static variable that you're using which is going to port out</span> <span data-start="450.49" data-end="455.21">to some value, here, you can actually update these in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="455.21" data-end="459.05">You can separate your logic and your styling again because you can keep the style part</span> <span data-start="459.05" data-end="463.599">in CSS and do the logic to change that value inside of your JavaScript, and then pass it,</span> <span data-start="463.599" data-end="469.68">and super dynamic and cool, so you get a name and a value with your basic custom properties,</span> <span data-start="469.68" data-end="473.27">but with the properties and values API, you get so much more than that.</span> <span data-start="473.27" data-end="479.08">You can specify a name for it, a syntax for it, and an initial value definition, and,</span> <span data-start="479.08" data-end="481.449">if it isn't going to inherit from its parent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.449" data-end="485.13">Let's look at the example again of the gradient.</span> <span data-start="485.13" data-end="490.18">We have our box, and I have a colour, so it is custom property, and I'm transitioning</span> <span data-start="490.18" data-end="491.199">from that colour.</span> <span data-start="491.199" data-end="495.199">I'm specifying the transition's going to be one second long, and on hover, it's going</span> <span data-start="495.199" data-end="496.389">to turn blue.</span> <span data-start="496.389" data-end="500.16">So, again, still not getting an interaction here.</span> <span data-start="500.16" data-end="502.74">It should take one second to register that colour.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="567.56" data-end="573.57">We are getting that one-second transition, if you notice, I'm not actually specifying</span> <span data-start="573.57" data-end="577.34">that custom property, that variable inside of the CSS here.</span> <span data-start="577.34" data-end="582.5">I don't have to do that because I've registered it in the CSS registered property.</span> <span data-start="582.5" data-end="583.88">I can update colour primary.</span> <span data-start="583.88" data-end="589.99">I can do colour primary red, and then if I run this, it will update to red.</span> <span data-start="589.99" data-end="590.99">There's no problem there.</span> <span data-start="590.99" data-end="592.05">We can always update it.</span> <span data-start="592.05" data-end="597.48">If I don't have a fall here, if I have a false value like 23, it will always fall back to</span> <span data-start="597.48" data-end="598.98">the blue-violet.</span> </p>
