data-start="14.129" data-end="17.14">my name is rob kerr i'm from IBM</span> <span data-start="17.14" data-end="19.09">research and I've come all the way from</span> <span data-start="19.09" data-end="25.09">Melbourne Australia so as it says up</span> <span data-start="25.09" data-end="26.08">there I'm going to talk to you about</span> <span data-start="26.08" data-end="28.75">science in the browser today I'm going</span> <span data-start="28.75" data-end="29.859">to talk to you about how I use a web</span> <span data-start="29.859" data-end="32.31">browser to orchestrate and visualize</span> <span data-start="32.31" data-end="34.93">simulations of neurons which are brain</span> <span data-start="34.93" data-end="37.87">cells but more generally I'm going to</span> <span data-start="37.87" data-end="39.28">speak to you about my experiences</span> <span data-start="39.28" data-end="42.4">working at the intersection of science</span> <span data-start="42.4" data-end="45.64">and web development but before I get to</span> <span data-start="45.64" data-end="48.13">that and if this will still work I'm</span> <span data-start="48.13" data-end="51.03">going to tell you to origin stories and</span> <span data-start="51.03" data-end="54.04">like all good origin stories these</span> <span data-start="54.04" data-end="58.24">involves science so the first of these I</span> <span data-start="58.24" data-end="59.92">think a lot of you'll probably be</span> <span data-start="59.92" data-end="62.29">familiar with and that is the birth of</span> <span data-start="62.29" data-end="65.379">the web so the web was created back in</span> <span data-start="65.379" data-end="69.42">the 1980s to help scientists do science</span> <span data-start="69.42" data-end="73.24">was created by that's the science lab</span> <span data-start="73.24" data-end="76">was created by tim berners-lee at CERN</span> <span data-start="76" data-end="79.92">and it was created to to solve a problem</span> <span data-start="79.92" data-end="82">particle physicists from around the</span> <span data-start="82" data-end="84.46">world needed better ways to access and</span> <span data-start="84.46" data-end="86.23">share the data that they collected while</span> <span data-start="86.23" data-end="89.94">they're out soon as Tim sort of put it</span> <span data-start="89.94" data-end="92.08">the data collected from different</span> <span data-start="92.08" data-end="93.76">experiments would be stored on different</span> <span data-start="93.76" data-end="95.11">computers you'd have to log onto these</span> <span data-start="95.11" data-end="97.81">computers manually you'd often have to</span> <span data-start="97.81" data-end="99.34">learn a new program or programming</span> <span data-start="99.34" data-end="102.1">language to get at the data and so he</span> <span data-start="102.1" data-end="104.409">saw the web as a way to simplify this to</span> <span data-start="104.409" data-end="106.06">make it easy to access and share the</span> <span data-start="106.06" data-end="108.729">data between like within the community</span> <span data-start="108.729" data-end="112.45">and shortly after this the web spun out</span> <span data-start="112.45" data-end="114.43">of the scientific community to become</span> <span data-start="114.43" data-end="119.56">what it is today oops so the second</span> <span data-start="119.56" data-end="122.74">origin story guess this isn't working</span> <span data-start="122.74" data-end="124.6">quite like he expected the second origin</span> <span data-start="124.6" data-end="127.33">story that i'd like to tell you is one</span> <span data-start="127.33" data-end="129.31">that i think very few over you feel</span> <span data-start="129.31" data-end="131.26">familiar with that's the story of how I</span> <span data-start="131.26" data-end="135.28">came to be speaking to you today</span> <span data-start="135.29" data-end="138.019">so like most of you sorry like many of</span> <span data-start="138.019" data-end="139.43">you here I've come to the web from</span> <span data-start="139.43" data-end="144.34">somewhere else my background is in</span> <span data-start="144.34" data-end="146.329">neuroscience it's in developing</span> <span data-start="146.329"

how they work this was something I</span> <span data-start="152.209" data-end="154.04">was so interested in fact I decided to</span> <span data-start="154.04" data-end="158.09">do a PhD in it and PhD specialties are</span> <span data-start="158.09" data-end="159.89">difficult it's not because you have to</span> <span data-start="159.89" data-end="163.25">be super smart that that does help but</span> <span data-start="163.25" data-end="165.829">it's because you have to work by</span> <span data-start="165.829" data-end="167.72">yourself on a single project for years</span> <span data-start="167.72" data-end="170.599">and years no one else really knows what</span> <span data-start="170.599" data-end="172.609">you're doing ultimately no one else</span> <span

data-start="177.26" data-end="179.079">of a PhD is a time of stress</span> <span data-start="179.079" data-end="184.549">disillusionment and procrastination now</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="248.15" data-end="250.629">Research to continue doing euro science</span> <span data-start="250.629" data-end="254.72">but now I'd had this taste for what web</span> <span data-start="254.72" data-end="256.07">could do I knew about this whole other</span> <span data-start="256.07" data-end="259.22">world of stuff and perhaps that could</span> <span data-start="259.22" data-end="262.58">help with my research but before I get</span> <span data-start="262.58" data-end="264.729">into that I'm going to give you a bit of</span> <span data-start="264.729" data-end="267.05">context and a bit more of an</span> <span data-start="267.05" data-end="268.31">understanding of what research it is</span> <span data-start="268.31" data-end="269.02">that I do</span> <span data-start="269.02" data-end="279.06">so this is going to work at all oh well</span> <span data-start="279.07" data-end="287.06">yeah place it's a really good transition</span> <span data-start="287.06" data-end="291.05">so I'm going to do it for the</span> <span data-start="291.05" data-end="306.1">transitions right yep</span> <span data-start="306.11" data-end="309.24">okay oh we're not Marin okay that's good</span> <span data-start="309.24" data-end="310.949">now we've got we've recreated the</span> <span data-start="310.949" data-end="312.24">failure and you leave that open because</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.24" data-end="315.479">I'm going to need to me later yeah it's</span> <span data-start="315.479" data-end="318.81">going to be fine so this is the other</span> <span data-start="318.81" data-end="323.12">monitor and so now if I click this and</span> <span data-start="323.12" data-end="325.68">wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait</span> <span data-start="325.68" data-end="331.99">wait</span> <span data-start="332" data-end="336.42">it's going to be good</span> <span data-start="336.43" data-end="344.66">gosh right right right right right Leigh</span> <span data-start="344.66" data-end="350.06">from current slide is that it it's a</span> <span data-start="350.06" data-end="361">wide slot that's what I wanted</span> <span data-start="361.01" data-end="363.57">well this is excellent because you're</span> <span data-start="363.57" data-end="368.97">really going to like this transition so</span> <span data-start="368.97" data-end="370.86">this is a plastic model of the human</span> <span data-start="370.86" data-end="374.22">brain it represents a hunk of meat that</span> <span data-start="374.22"

data-end="381.42">decisions it gives us our sense of self</span> <span data-start="381.42" data-end="383.33">and our ability to comprehend the world</span> <span data-start="383.33" data-end="385.98">it allows us to learn to move and to</span> <span data-start="385.98" data-end="388.74">speak information from our senses such</span> <span data-start="388.74" data-end="390.21">as our eyes our ears and our fingertips</span> <span data-start="390.21" data-end="393.39">is all sent to the brain to be</span> <span data-start="393.39" data-end="395.07">remembered to be understood

data-start="399.87" data-end="403.23">largely a mystery and finding out is one</span> <span data-start="403.23" data-end="405.65">of the fundamental goals of neuroscience</span> <span data-start="405.65" data-end="408.06">one thing we do know however is the</span> <span data-start="408.06" data-end="409.71">brain is made up of an enormous network</span> <span data-start="409.71" data-end="412.56">of neurons of cells called neurons ready</span> <span data-start="412.56" data-end="422.19">for it so the human brain contains</span> <span data-start="422.19" data-end="424.34">approximately 86 billion neurons and</span> <span data-start="424.34" data-end="427.02">each of these makes 10,000 connections</span> <span data-start="427.02" data-end="429.75">with other cells in the brain it is this</span> <span data-start="429.75" data-end="432.03">large dense network of cells that</span> <span data-start="432.03" data-end="433.77">scientists believe give rise to all of</span> <span data-start="433.77" data-end="435.95">these abilities that I just mentioned</span> <span data-start="435.95" data-end="438.81">but let's zoom in now through some</span> <span data-start="438.81" data-end="442.08">individual neurons what we see is that</span> <span data-start="442.08" data-end="443.97">these all have a common structure they</span> <span data-start="443.97" data-end="446.31">have a cell body called the soma they</span> <span data-start="446.31" data-end="447.75">have incoming fibers called dendrites</span> <span data-start="447.75" data-end="449.91">and have an outgoing fiber called an</span> <span data-start="449.91" data-end="453.27">axon this axon end branches and it forms</span> <span data-start="453.27" data-end="454.56">connections onto the dendrites of other</span> <span data-start="454.56" data-end="460.53">neurons yet despite this basic common</span> <span data-start="460.53" data-end="462.9">structure there is a large variety of</span> <span data-start="462.9" data-end="464.61">different neuron morphologies found</span> <span data-start="464.61" data-end="467.4">throughout the brain so here are some</span> <span data-start="467.4" data-end="470.58">examples and examples of even more of</span> <span data-start="470.58" data-end="474.5">these can be found online ok so now</span> <span data-start="474.5" data-end="482.76">going to mirror</span> <span data-start="482.77" data-end="486.17">at a website called neuromorphic org you</span> <span data-start="486.17" data-end="489.44">guys can say that yes so this is an</span> <span data-start="489.44" data-end="491.15">online database of neuron morphologies</span> <span data-start="491.15" data-end="493.22">and that have been uploaded by</span> <span data-start="493.22" data-end="495.59">experimentalists so what happens is</span> <span data-start="495.59" data-end="497.99">experimentalists get fluorescent dye and</span> <span data-start="497.99" data-end="500.6">they inject the eject the dye into the</span> <span data-start="500.6" data-end="502.49">neuron cells so that they stand out from</span> <span data-start="502.49" data-end="504.47">the other neurons they then take a</span> <span data-start="504.47" data-end="505.94">series of microscope images at different</span> <span data-start="505.94" data-end="509">depths and they then get these images</span> <span data-start="509" data-end="510.83">and they painstakingly know they get</span> <span data-start="510.83" data-end="512.36">their students to painstakingly trace</span> <span data-start="512.36" data-end="514.7">through these images in order to</span> <span data-start="514.7" data-end="518.51">recreate the full 3d morphology now here</span> <span data-start="518.51" data-end="520.61">we see some images of these sort of</span> <span data-start="520.61" data-end="523.51">morphology so these are static 2d images</span> <span data-start="523.51" data-end="525.47">so they give you an idea of what the</span> <span data-start="525.47" data-end="527.54">morphology looks like but what they</span> <span data-start="527.54" data-end="530.96">actually look like is this they're</span> <span data-start="530.96" data-end="533.3">actually text files so each row in this</span> <span data-start="533.3" data-end="535.22">text file corresponds to a point on the</span> <span data-start="535.22" data-end="538.37">neuron the first the first done column</span> <span data-start="538.37" data-end="541.88">is the ID each row then has a type so</span> <span data-start="541.88" data-end="544.4">milord end Raider axon has XYZ</span> <span data-start="544.4" data-end="546.41">coordinates and as a radius telling you</span> <span data-start="546.41" data-end="548.41">how thick the fibers at that point and</span> <span data-start="548.41" data-end="551.78">then starting from the cell body which</span> <span data-start="551.78" data-end="555.26">is negative 1 they all have the parent</span> <span data-start="555.26" data-end="556.76">point the idea of the parent point and</span> <span data-start="556.76" data-end="558.23">in this way it construct sort of the</span> <span data-start="558.23" data-end="561.65">tree that is in your arm now very often</span> <span data-start="561.65" data-end="563.39">in science having a good way to</span> <span data-start="563.39" data-end="567.08">visualize your data is is key this is a</span> <span data-start="567.08" data-end="568.7">prime example because just looking at</span> <span data-start="568.7" data-end="570.59">this file we can't see what's going on</span> <span data-start="570.59" data-end="572.38">we can't see what this neuron looks like</span> <span data-start="572.38" data-end="575.09">so what I decided to do was to build</span> <span data-start="575.09" data-end="577.91">build a simple tool to to visualize this</span> <span data-start="577.91" data-end="581.21">morphology and existing tools were</span> <span data-start="581.21" data-end="582.41">already out there that's how they made</span> <span data-start="582.41" data-end="585.05">those images but I wanted to learn three</span> <span data-start="585.05" data-end="588.65">jazz and I also I wanted something sort</span> <span data-start="588.65" data-end="591.14">of simple in and easy to use that I</span> <span data-start="591.14" data-end="593.48">could extend how I want it so i'll just</span> <span data-start="593.48" data-end="599.82">show you a demo of that now so this is</span> <span data-start="599.83" data-end="602.12">let's make it a bit figure so you can</span> <span data-start="602.12" data-end="605.33">see so here i can upload that file we</span> <span data-start="605.33" data-end="609.53">were just looking up</span> <span data-start="609.54" data-end="611.86">and we can see it loads here it's a bit</span> <span data-start="611.86" data-end="614.74">small but now we can we can rotate and</span> <span data-start="614.74" data-end="617.47">zoom in and see the full 3d morphology</span> <span data-start="617.47" data-end="619.6">so here we've got the blue and purple</span> <span data-start="619.6" data-end="621.459">fibers at the dendrites so the incoming</span> <span data-start="621.459" data-end="623.889">fibers the cell body is sort of just a</span> <span data-start="623.889" data-end="625.6">point and then in white we've got the</span> <span data-start="625.6" data-end="627.94">outgoing axon so this neurons upside</span> <span data-start="627.94" data-end="630.389">down to the one I showed you previously</span> <span data-start="630.389" data-end="632.949">and so this is nice i now have sort of a</span> <span data-start="632.949" data-end="636.48">visual way to interact with my model but</span> <span data-start="636.48" data-end="643.61">okay now I've got to do this again</span> <span data-start="643.62" data-end="649.51">settle in each digit</span> <span data-start="649.52" data-end="651.68">yes</span> <span data-start="651.68" data-end="655.8">jump forward so I now have I now have</span> <span data-start="655.8" data-end="657.449">this nice way of interacting visually</span> <span data-start="657.449" data-end="659.94">with my data but for a moment let's get</span> <span data-start="659.94"
