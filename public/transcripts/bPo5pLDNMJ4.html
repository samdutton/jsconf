<p><span data-start="800.71" data-end="802.54">I'm like in now and there's this</span> <span data-start="802.54" data-end="807.16">coworker Joe and then at the fourth line</span> <span

we can do TDD s / v DD and we do</span> <span data-start="821.35" data-end="823.51">that by kind of moving and now remember</span> <span data-start="823.51" data-end="825.01">we're doing outside in so we're on the</span> <span data-start="825.01" data-end="827.53">outside now we're moving one step in and</span> <span data-start="827.53" data-end="830.29">one step in in this case would be kind</span> <span data-start="830.29" data-end="833.26">of the HTTP layer interface so so kind</span> <span data-start="833.26" data-end="836.71">of your web app controller whatever</span> <span data-start="836.71" data-end="840.07">level and so since we're testing we're</span> <span data-start="840.07" data-end="841.54">not implementing that yet where were</span> <span data-start="841.54" data-end="845.17">writing a you test case and this is our</span> <span data-start="845.17" data-end="849.19">pseudocode so but it should kind of work</span> <span data-start="849.19" data-end="851.26">like this right um so you could use</span> <span data-start="851.26" data-end="853.78">something like Val stairs or jasmine</span> <span data-start="853.78" data-end="858.25">also to write this test and so now will</span> <span data-start="858.25" data-end="860.96">encode level and we're writing a test so</span> <span data-start="860.96" data-end="862.79">it says here it should load all the</span> <span data-start="862.79" data-end="866.39">co-workers so we are kind of yeah just</span> <span data-start="866.39" data-end="868.01">implementing some some tests that a</span> <span data-start="868.01" data-end="869.75">checks if the database is being asked</span> <span data-start="869.75" data-end="871.55">for the co-workers then there's another</span> <span data-start="871.55" data-end="874.52">one that checks that the response that</span> <span data-start="874.52" data-end="877.49">comes back is actually a success so the</span> <span data-start="877.49" data-end="880.88">state is 200 and then we have that and</span> <span data-start="880.88" data-end="883.31">then we implement that which will</span> <span data-start="883.31" data-end="885.53">probably look something like this if</span> <span data-start="885.53" data-end="888.14">you're using a space or something else</span> <span data-start="888.14" data-end="891.77">not really that interesting here and so</span> <span data-start="891.77" data-end="897.05">we run that again and so yeah well once</span> <span data-start="897.05" data-end="899.42">again on that list of coworkers and</span> <span data-start="899.42" data-end="901.25">still doesn't work we have the page now</span> <span data-start="901.25" data-end="902.84">but there's them some around the</span> <span data-start="902.84" data-end="905.48">database so what to fix that as well and</span> <span data-start="905.48" data-end="908.45">there's a view missing in the database</span> <span data-start="908.45" data-end="910.1">so I'm I need to write a test for that</span> <span data-start="910.1" data-end="913.1">as well run it again and now that works</span> <span data-start="913.1" data-end="916.61">and then the next step failed so i want</span> <span data-start="916.61" data-end="918.32">to click on Joe's name and that doesn't</span> <span data-start="918.32" data-end="920.54">work and so I keep going right i mean</span> <span data-start="920.54" data-end="923.83">you get the idea it's just normal TDD</span> <span data-start="923.83" data-end="932.15">test fail pass and so on so yeah that is</span> <span data-start="932.15" data-end="934.01">that's kind of the outside-in thing so</span> <span data-start="934.01" data-end="936.74">you start with the feature description</span> <span data-start="936.74" data-end="938.69">you describe what you want your software</span> <span data-start="938.69" data-end="940.7">to do oh oh you want to interact with it</span> <span data-start="940.7" data-end="942.83">and when you've got that it's pretty</span> <span data-start="942.83" data-end="944.54">much filling out the blanks right you're</span> <span data-start="944.54" data-end="947.12">just running the tests and it tells you</span> <span data-start="947.12" data-end="949.31">what to do next oh this isn't working ok</span> <span data-start="949.31" data-end="953.48">right it has for it fix it next and also</span> <span data-start="953.48" data-end="955.34">what's pretty cool is that you know when</span> <span data-start="955.34" data-end="957.14">you're done because as soon as</span> <span data-start="957.14" data-end="960.01">everything's green you can stop coding</span> <span data-start="960.01" data-end="963.08">instead of just keep working on and on</span> <span data-start="963.08" data-end="966.41">and on and just adding stuff you have a</span> <span data-start="966.41" data-end="969.05">clear goal where to go all right and</span> <span data-start="969.05" data-end="971.87">when you're done and so what that means</span> <span data-start="971.87" data-end="973.52">is that you're the design you're going</span> <span data-start="973.52" data-end="975.74">to come up with is probably a very</span> <span data-start="975.74" data-end="978.98">simple solution that just does what the</span> <span data-start="978.98" data-end="982.92">future describes are not anything else</span> <span data-start="982.93" data-end="986.9">also a nice side effect of that is that</span> <span data-start="986.9" data-end="988.34">you have a pretty good test coverage</span> <span data-start="988.34" data-end="991.56">since you're writing your test first</span> <span data-start="991.56" data-end="994.89">you're literally literally not writing</span> <span data-start="994.89" data-end="997.77">any untested code so I was a failing</span> <span data-start="997.77" data-end="1001">test before you're implementing it and</span> <span data-start="1001" data-end="1003.68">so you also have those kind of multiple</span> <span data-start="1003.68" data-end="1005.42">levels of confidence in your code</span> <span data-start="1005.42" data-end="1007.46">because you still have those unit tests</span> <span data-start="1007.46" data-end="1009.74">that you know from from traditional TDD</span> <span data-start="1009.74" data-end="1012.32">by the way how many people here do tests</span> <span data-start="1012.32" data-end="1025.88">first f you okay so yeah so you have</span> <span data-start="1025.88" data-end="1027.77">those if you do it and then you also</span> <span data-start="1027.77" data-end="1029.42">have these kind of high level tests as</span> <span data-start="1029.42" data-end="1031.579">well these cucumbers and Aereo's and</span> <span data-start="1031.579" data-end="1033.77">that tell you that you're different</span> <span data-start="1033.77" data-end="1035.48">layers still work together because I</span> <span data-start="1035.48" data-end="1037.28">mean a unit has only tests like one</span> <span data-start="1037.28" data-end="1039.11">method of one object but what you really</span> <span data-start="1039.11" data-end="1041.959">need if you have like a spec that web</span> <span data-start="1041.959" data-end="1043.91">apps have you need to make sure that</span> <span data-start="1043.91" data-end="1046.04">your different layers to fit together so</span> <span data-start="1046.04" data-end="1048.92">yeah the database maybe observer and</span> <span data-start="1048.92" data-end="1051.35">then HTML and client-side code and all</span> <span data-start="1051.35" data-end="1055.37">that I'm just getting back to this</span> <span data-start="1055.37" data-end="1063.11">example that we saw here you might have</span> <span data-start="1063.11" data-end="1065.57">noticed we're clicking on a link here</span> <span data-start="1065.57" data-end="1070.97">and so how does it do that right it</span> <span data-start="1070.97" data-end="1075.71">clicks on links so it can and so the</span> <span data-start="1075.71" data-end="1078.62">answer how that works as there's a bunch</span> <span data-start="1078.62" data-end="1081.4">of cool tools now so we're at the next</span> <span data-start="1081.4" data-end="1084.11">section of my talk and those tools are</span> <span data-start="1084.11" data-end="1087.56">or can be these so first of all what you</span> <span data-start="1087.56" data-end="1090.01">can do of course is just parse HTML</span> <span data-start="1090.01" data-end="1094.82">using some XML parser find the link and</span> <span data-start="1094.82" data-end="1099.14">then pass out the hof and do that what</span> <span data-start="1099.14" data-end="1100.97">you can also do is use a headless</span> <span data-start="1100.97" data-end="1104.63">browser like for example htmlunit that</span> <span data-start="1104.63" data-end="1107.69">is a written in java and it's sort of a</span> <span data-start="1107.69" data-end="1110.66">complete browser without the GUI so you</span> <span data-start="1110.66" data-end="1112.19">can run it from the shell and tell it</span> <span data-start="1112.19" data-end="1116.69">what you do and it works kind of well it</span> <span data-start="1116.69" data-end="1120.32">has a few quirks and bugs in but you can</span> <span data-start="1120.32" data-end="1121.73">work with that and if that doesn't work</span> <span data-start="1121.73" data-end="1123.16">or you need extra</span> <span data-start="1123.16" data-end="1126.73">our extra testing awesomeness you can</span> <span data-start="1126.73" data-end="1130.15">actually use a real browser for example</span> <span data-start="1130.15" data-end="1134.17">selenium is a tool that allows you to</span> <span data-start="1134.17" data-end="1137.38">run or to script browsers behavior so</span> <span data-start="1137.38" data-end="1140.53">you can tell a browser from your test</span> <span data-start="1140.53" data-end="1142.9">what you do click on that link hover</span> <span data-start="1142.9" data-end="1145.84">over here do that and it'll do that and</span> <span data-start="1145.84" data-end="1148.47">you can run a surgeon's against that and</span> <span data-start="1148.47" data-end="1154.12">yeah test your app and there's a little</span> <span data-start="1154.12" data-end="1156.55">problem with these tools are the most</span> <span data-start="1156.55" data-end="1158.11">sophisticated they get that would slower</span> <span data-start="1158.11" data-end="1159.91">it is so running a selenium test takes</span> <span data-start="1159.91" data-end="1164.32">ages versus just passing HTML obviously</span> <span data-start="1164.32" data-end="1166.42">is much faster because it's just in</span> <span data-start="1166.42" data-end="1170.29">process right on the other hand you get</span> <span data-start="1170.29" data-end="1172.33">much more features if you're running a</span> <span data-start="1172.33" data-end="1174.25">real browser because you can also test</span> <span data-start="1174.25" data-end="1176.62">for browser compatibility issues and</span> <span data-start="1176.62" data-end="1178.42">that kind of stuff if you're using that</span> <span data-start="1178.42" data-end="1181.57">and if you're only using that headless</span> <span data-start="1181.57" data-end="1185.08">browser it's just well it's not the real</span> <span data-start="1185.08" data-end="1187.18">thing right so if the reader browser may</span> <span data-start="1187.18" data-end="1188.46">have to be different from this one and</span> <span data-start="1188.46" data-end="1193.33">your test one catch it and so you kind</span> <span data-start="1193.33" data-end="1194.5">of want to use these three altogether</span> <span data-start="1194.5" data-end="1196.51">depending on which scenario we have you</span> <span data-start="1196.51" data-end="1199.03">if you have a text you need to use at</span> <span data-start="1199.03" data-end="1200.62">least the headless browser if you just</span> <span data-start="1200.62" data-end="1202.99">have static HTML you can you see in the</span> <span data-start="1202.99" data-end="1206.29">inline HTML parser and so the good news</span> <span data-start="1206.29" data-end="1209.74">is there is a tool called capybara how</span> <span data-start="1209.74" data-end="1214.51">many people know that okay so capybara</span> <span data-start="1214.51" data-end="1224.71">is pretty cool because it allows you so</span> <span data-start="1224.71" data-end="1226.99">the tool to run all these others so it's</span> <span data-start="1226.99" data-end="1228.97">kind of an abstraction that runs all</span> <span data-start="1228.97" data-end="1232.75">these inside of cucumber the downside</span> <span data-start="1232.75" data-end="1234.22">for you guys is that it's written in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1234.22" data-end="1238.29">Ruby if that is a problem for for anyone</span> <span data-start="1238.29" data-end="1241.6">so the step definitions that i showed</span> <span data-start="1241.6" data-end="1243.82">you actually are not really true because</span> <span data-start="1243.82" data-end="1245.38">you're going to be writing ruby and</span> <span data-start="1245.38" data-end="1249.16">those which looks a bit different it</span> <span data-start="1249.16" data-end="1252.85">should be readable right and so yeah</span> <span data-start="1252.85" data-end="1255.03">what you can do is just</span> <span data-start="1255.03" data-end="1258.96">um tag the scenario here you can see at</span> <span data-start="1258.96" data-end="1263.61">javascript and then fiddle run in a</span> <span data-start="1263.61" data-end="1267.54">browser and so yeah full psych testing</span> <span data-start="1267.54" data-end="1269.28">which means you can test anything you</span> <span data-start="1269.28" data-end="1270.93">want client-side server site as a matter</span> <span data-start="1270.93" data-end="1275.34">the app is well tested and you have no</span> <span data-start="1275.34" data-end="1279.89">more bugs of course at least not so many</span> <span data-start="1279.89" data-end="1284.1">so back to my little project I was lucky</span> <span data-start="1284.1" data-end="1286.23">man so my initial idea was I would be</span> <span data-start="1286.23" data-end="1288.57">spending about four weeks on it cuz i</span> <span data-start="1288.57" data-end="1290.34">was just using it for myself to make my</span> <span data-start="1290.34" data-end="1292.32">own life easier right and so it would be</span> <span data-start="1292.32" data-end="1294.33">really simple and I wouldn't add much</span> <span data-start="1294.33" data-end="1297.45">and would be cool turns out I was</span> <span data-start="1297.45" data-end="1300.87">totally wrong on that cuz we started</span> <span data-start="1300.87" data-end="1302.25">offering that to other spaces as a</span> <span data-start="1302.25" data-end="1305.58">service and instead of four weeks and</span> <span data-start="1305.58" data-end="1307.44">not eight months almost full time and</span> <span data-start="1307.44" data-end="1309.33">that and we've had a tons of new</span> <span data-start="1309.33" data-end="1311.55">features and had to change some designs</span> <span data-start="1311.55" data-end="1313.91">and then swapped out code code and the</span> <span data-start="1313.91" data-end="1318.6">the code base and so we drew a lot</span> <span data-start="1318.6" data-end="1321.42">bigger than it was intended to be and</span> <span data-start="1321.42" data-end="1324.75">for that kind of changing software unit</span> <span data-start="1324.75" data-end="1325.77">tests don't really help you anymore</span> <span data-start="1325.77" data-end="1329.37">because I mean you still need them but</span> <span data-start="1329.37" data-end="1331.59">as I said you're not you're not covering</span> <span data-start="1331.59" data-end="1334.08">the interaction between your layers and</span> <span data-start="1334.08" data-end="1336.06">those tests so if you're changing my</span> <span data-start="1336.06" data-end="1338.19">lair the unit tests on that layer are</span> <span data-start="1338.19" data-end="1339.51">still working and also on the others</span> <span data-start="1339.51" data-end="1341.52">what your software's are broken so you</span> <span data-start="1341.52" data-end="1344.43">still need to test that and so what you</span> <span data-start="1344.43" data-end="1348.93">really need is a field of cucumbers AKA</span> <span data-start="1348.93" data-end="1352.32">cucumber test suite and so the advantage</span> <span data-start="1352.32" data-end="1354.12">that you get here is that it's totally</span> <span data-start="1354.12" data-end="1355.41">implementation independence in the</span> <span data-start="1355.41" data-end="1357.66">sexual language that means it's very</span> <span data-start="1357.66" data-end="1361.17">stable you can literally literally swept</span> <span data-start="1361.17" data-end="1363.05">swap out your entire code base and</span> <span data-start="1363.05" data-end="1365.76">replace it with something else and those</span> <span data-start="1365.76" data-end="1368.13">tests are still the same which means you</span> <span data-start="1368.13" data-end="1370.44">can run the new software against the</span> <span data-start="1370.44" data-end="1372.03">same test and so make sure that you</span> <span data-start="1372.03" data-end="1374.64">didn't break anything and so that was</span> <span data-start="1374.64" data-end="1377.39">pretty cool for that kind of stuff um</span> <span data-start="1377.39" data-end="1381.81">yeah it's a huge safety net three</span> <span data-start="1381.81" data-end="1384.53">minutes okay so big safety net and</span> <span data-start="1384.53" data-end="1386.36">my character effect or everything I need</span> <span data-start="1386.36" data-end="1388.75">and this way I can keep my coat clean</span> <span data-start="1388.75" data-end="1391.04">extensible maintainable that wouldn't</span> <span data-start="1391.04" data-end="1392.45">have been possible without those tests I</span> <span data-start="1392.45" data-end="1394.19">would keep breaking stuff again and</span> <span data-start="1394.19" data-end="1396.53">again and so on this way I must have a</span> <span data-start="1396.53" data-end="1399.17">nice picture yeah I can avoid the Aggies</span> <span data-start="1399.17" data-end="1403.01">spaghetti monster I need to be quick now</span> <span data-start="1403.01" data-end="1408.68">so M tools just to recap cucumber allows</span> <span data-start="1408.68" data-end="1410.21">you to write tests a natural language</span> <span data-start="1410.21" data-end="1412.25">and any right of step definitions which</span> <span data-start="1412.25" data-end="1414.86">is to map the natural language to the</span> <span data-start="1414.86" data-end="1417.56">implementation capybara is a written</span> </p>
