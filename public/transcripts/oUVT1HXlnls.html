<p><span data-start="25.539" data-end="31.57">Hello everyone, my name is Alejandro, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Can we look at the slides</span> <span data-start="31.57" data-end="46.35">please. Can you unlock the Mac, please. Well, from Buenso Ares, a beautiful city. Where</span> <span data-start="46.35" data-end="51.949">you can dance tang go eat a great stake and have some of the best wine in the world. If</span> <span data-start="51.949" data-end="63.909">you like any of those things, you should definitely come and visit us. Awesome. Tango. I have</span> <span data-start="63.909" data-end="69.689">been writing JavaScript for a living for the last three years, I'm also a member of the</span> <span data-start="69.689" data-end="76.61">node school Buenos Aires chapters, if you want, come and find me after the talk, I have</span> <span data-start="76.61" data-end="86.31">stickers. Maybe some of you heard that JavaScript turned 20 years this last May. I think that's</span> <span data-start="86.31" data-end="91.88">a really, really awesome milestone. How many of you have been writing JavaScript for more</span> <span data-start="91.88" data-end="100.78">than five years? Okay, that's awesome, that's kind of fifty or 70\hpercent. How many for</span> <span data-start="100.78" data-end="112.31">more than ten years? Okay, we have 30\hpercent. How many for more than five teen years? Oh,</span> <span data-start="112.31" data-end="118.78">that's incredible. You should definitely talk with them. They are very interesting people.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.78" data-end="124.81">And I know a lot of you are thinking, but, Aljeantr that's crazy nobody would ever think</span> <span data-start="124.81" data-end="135.29">of writing JavaScript 15 years ago and live without it. So, what I'm trying to talk about</span> <span data-start="135.29" data-end="144.06">today is JavaScript is the compiled 2 target for many programming languages today like</span> <span data-start="144.06" data-end="152.62">tide script, closure, dart and many, many more. And Surma talked about this on Friday</span> <span data-start="152.62" data-end="162.939">about the state of the industry today. Also JavaScript has been years to control electronics,</span> <span data-start="162.939" data-end="168.04">to control row boats, drones, even the lights of a conference room, if you stayed up late</span> <span data-start="168.04" data-end="175.879">on Friday, I think that's awesome. Everyone here could say the future of JavaScript lacks</span> <span data-start="175.879" data-end="180.809">promising. But I wound\h‑‑ looks promising\h‑‑ but I wonder, do we know where we came from,</span> <span data-start="180.809" data-end="189.659">do we know what makes JavaScript suitable for real world applications? I hope by the</span> <span data-start="189.659" data-end="197.559">end of the talk you wall have really good opinion on those questions. So, particularly,</span> <span data-start="197.559" data-end="210.889">we're going to talk about ECMA script, which is the standard that which JavaScript is regularized.</span> <span data-start="210.889" data-end="220.68">And the latest version is 2015 AKA version 6. We will go through all the transition between</span> <span data-start="220.68" data-end="226.769">the previous versions to the very first one. And after, that we're going to walk about</span> <span data-start="226.769" data-end="234.279">the time from the first release to the invention of the language and last we're going to talk</span> <span data-start="234.279" data-end="248.069">about how the process changed committee of ECMA script is working on the next releases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="248.069" data-end="255.73">Let's go and talk about the transition from ES2015 to ES 5 and even if we had a full day</span> <span data-start="255.73" data-end="263.49">talking about ES6, I think we will have some futures how we got\h‑‑ it's really big,</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="269.25">and I have very short list of some of the most important features and controversial</span> <span data-start="269.25" data-end="276.729">too, which are classes RO functions the iter raptors, proxies, destructuring, let and Const</span> <span data-start="276.729" data-end="287.04">and many more. For you to get an idea of how big JavaScript is in the version 6, we have</span> <span data-start="287.04" data-end="294.01">here a graph that shows us from the left the first release of the ECMA script standard,</span> <span data-start="294.01" data-end="299.15">and on the right, we have the last one. In the vertical access, wev the pictures per</span> <span data-start="299.15" data-end="310.2">speck ‑‑ thee we have the pages per Spec, we can see the first two are quite the same.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.2" data-end="317.23">In the third one we have a\h‑‑ pages and the same for the ES 5spec, but in the last</span> <span data-start="317.23" data-end="327.07">one we have more double pages. So it's quite big. And if you don't know about any of these</span> <span data-start="327.07" data-end="336.04">features that we talked about I would strongly suggest that you first start learning. Here</span> <span data-start="336.04" data-end="342.72">are some of the books that you could use in the process of learning ES6, I think the second</span> <span data-start="342.72" data-end="351.1">one is not yet finished. You could ask Axel, I think he's around here. Let's go and talk</span> <span data-start="351.1" data-end="359.71">about the transition from ES 5 to ES 4. Or what what would have been the JavaScript version</span> <span data-start="359.71" data-end="370.91">2. Turns out, we didn't have an ES4 release, and I think the main reason for that is because</span> <span data-start="370.91" data-end="377.68">the actual proposal for ES 4 would break the system web at that moment. I think that's</span> <span data-start="377.68" data-end="386.35">a very compelling reason for not to release that. Many people from Adobe Mozilla and Apple</span> <span data-start="386.35" data-end="395.5">were work on what has been done the version of ES 4 and at the same time, another group</span> <span data-start="395.5" data-end="404.4">lead by Microsoft and Yahoo were working on ES 3.1, a "fixed" version of ES 3. And the</span> <span data-start="404.4" data-end="412.64">work being done in ES 3.1 was tightly coupled with what ES 4 would be, so that ended up</span> <span data-start="412.64" data-end="420.98">in a struggle between both groups and getting consensus from both was really difficult.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.98" data-end="429.48">From that struggle, harmony agenda was created. And that lead to the future release that we</span> <span data-start="429.48" data-end="438.78">know today ES 5. ES 4 had also some successors like action script version 3, which was, in</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="449.5">fact, a fork of JavaScript the work at Microsoft at that moment. Here we have an extract from</span> <span data-start="449.5" data-end="457.81">a Blog post from Douglass Crockfrrord E.S 4 was so large and innovative there were doubts</span> <span data-start="457.81" data-end="464.99">that it could be successful as specified and implemented. I think what Douglass here is</span> <span data-start="464.99" data-end="472.96">trying to tell us is that he didn't\h‑‑ they didn't think on among lairty, they were</span> <span data-start="472.96" data-end="481.03">too ambition in the standards body\h‑‑ they were trying to innovate in a standards</span> <span data-start="481.03" data-end="488.98">body Douglass later in a Blog post said he thinks it should be the other way around,</span> <span data-start="488.98" data-end="498.389">innovation should happen outside the standard. So, any way, let's talk about the previous,</span> <span data-start="498.389" data-end="506.79">the actual previous version of ES 5, which was ES 3, for you to get an idea of the context,</span> <span data-start="506.79" data-end="513.529">what was happening another that moment, we have a short timeline. ES 5 was published</span> <span data-start="513.529" data-end="521.729">on the year 20 09D and previously in the year 2006 was the first release of J query that</span> <span data-start="521.729" data-end="530.959">same year AJAX was being standardized by the W3C committee N the year 200 40 , we have</span> <span data-start="530.959" data-end="535.67">the release of J mail, one of the first web applications (Gmail one of the first web applications</span> <span data-start="535.67" data-end="545.36">that pushed JavaScript limits. In the year 2000 we have a black hole and the draft for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="545.36" data-end="552.269">ES 3 was publish in the the year 1999. So we have a span of ten years that there was</span> <span data-start="552.269" data-end="565.17">no new releases. Here we have Douglass and Crawford in one of the meetings, I don't want</span> <span data-start="565.17" data-end="571.47">to say which one is on the left and which one is on the right (Laughing) so let's talk</span> <span data-start="571.47" data-end="580.009">about what ES 5 actually introduced or we didn't have in ES 3. One of the most important</span> <span data-start="580.009" data-end="589.899">things, I think is strict mode, strict mode helped us to avoid global links to avoid us</span> <span data-start="589.899" data-end="603.309">weird coercion problems with con instructors, and help us with Constroctors, introduced</span> <span data-start="603.309" data-end="615.779">betters and setters, higher order array like RI.map and RI .4H, so JSON, who remembers</span> <span data-start="615.779" data-end="628.8">adding the JSON.JS to the library of HTML. Not so many, awesome. Other methods like object.sale</span> <span data-start="628.8" data-end="634.519">and object.freeze, which were great if you are in differentialsive programming paradigm</span> <span data-start="634.519" data-end="643.41">(Object.seal) one of the things that actually got my attention was that  wasn't</span> <span data-start="643.41" data-end="649.79">mutable. And I think, this is in the year 2009, and what I mean with immutable is that</span> <span data-start="649.79" data-end="658.42">you could do something like this, you could make an assignment to  and that actually</span> <span data-start="658.42" data-end="665.61">would take effect and supported.UI the third party script to your page. Itaú BBA will</span> <span data-start="665.61" data-end="676.79">totally break your type check on your  variables. And I think that's sucks (Laughing)</span> <span data-start="676.79" data-end="684.04">let's go on the next transition from ES 3 to ES 2. For you to have an idea was the previous</span> <span data-start="684.04" data-end="693.97">year of the release of ES 3. ES 3 introduced one of the most important parts for popular</span> <span data-start="693.97" data-end="701.639">handling which was try/catch, we didn't have that before ES 3, which was insane. Some of</span> <span data-start="701.639" data-end="709.029">these trick comparison, that Dimitri told us on Friday that you should not depend on</span> <span data-start="709.029" data-end="720.149">strict comparison. And instanceof operator. Function.apply, which was useful for method</span> <span data-start="720.149" data-end="728.079">borrowing and functional programming paradigm. The switch statement. Function expressions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="728.079" data-end="735.189">An some of the others array helpers such as slice, splice, contact, reverse and many,</span> <span data-start="735.189" data-end="744.689">many many more. For you to have an idea of what the people was thinking of, during the</span> <span data-start="744.689" data-end="754.019">specification here are some reserved words for ES 2, which are a lot, if you know most</span> <span data-start="754.019" data-end="763.679">of these features and key words, it's because from 40 of them, 38 are also a Java key word.</span> <span data-start="763.679" data-end="773.759">And this should tell us that the people working in the specification would denied they were</span> <span data-start="773.759" data-end="784.759">trying to make JavaScript to look like a Java‑like programming, which was in fact unfortunate.</span> <span data-start="784.759" data-end="793.91">Going from the ESG to ES 1 specification we at no time have too much changes, which should</span> <span data-start="793.91" data-end="804.929">be normal because it was only 7 pages difference. But let's come out from the first release</span> <span data-start="804.929" data-end="812.139">of the specification to the actual creation of the language, which the name was originally</span> <span data-start="812.139" data-end="824.819">Mocha. And the things that I found was quite awkward because I wouldn't\h‑‑ I wouldn't</span> <span data-start="824.819" data-end="832.709">had anything to read, there was no Blog post about how JavaScript or Mocha should work.</span> <span data-start="832.709" data-end="841.519">So, the only thing that I had is the browser, at least the browser implementation at that</span> <span data-start="841.519" data-end="850.319">moment. For you to have an idea of the context was the year '95 and other inventions that</span> <span data-start="850.319" data-end="857.619">year was the Java programming language, Ruby and PHP which seemed a really good year to</span> <span data-start="857.619" data-end="870.22">inSeptember a language. One of the features I found on browser implementation was that</span> <span data-start="870.22" data-end="876.379">con instructor property couldn't be set by assignment. This was the actual error message</span> <span data-start="876.379" data-end="884.319">that the browser would send to you if you tried to assign to that property, I don't</span> <span data-start="884.319" data-end="895.119">know if this was a browser limitation or it was on the original JavaScript spec. You didn't</span> <span data-start="895.119" data-end="905.029">have any acor object literals, so for creation of objects and arrays you would have to write</span> <span data-start="905.029" data-end="912.36">the whole new object, new array, can you imagine that, using nine characters? That's crazy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="912.36" data-end="920.679">And, at that point, any JavaScript error would open up a pop up in your browser, which was,</span> <span data-start="920.679" data-end="931.129">it seems really bad decision. And I learned this because by accident I typed in Google</span> <span data-start="931.129" data-end="938.559">and press enter and what happened next was a really nice rainbow of pop ups saying that</span> <span data-start="938.559" data-end="947.3">you had a lot of errors because it was ES 5, of course. Nobody would ever run ES 1.</span> <span data-start="947.3" data-end="955.049">And if\h‑‑ after too many of those pop ups, you would have another one saying that</span> <span data-start="955.049" data-end="964.459">you would have too many errors, that kind of sarcastic. (Laughing) for method implementations</span> <span data-start="964.459" data-end="971.439">on the global option, you would have something like this if you tried to check if something</span> <span data-start="971.439" data-end="981.389">is . And my reaction was, well, you're kind of\h‑‑ true, it's true, undefined</span> <span data-start="981.389" data-end="991.85">is not defined. (Laughing) and then I realized, oh, you're asking me to implement ,</span> <span data-start="991.85" data-end="1000.509">which was not a reference, so I wrote a pretty library that could polyfill undefine. It's</span> <span data-start="1000.509" data-end="1010.619">called undefine.JS, and it has only one line and it seems kind of like this: So you assign</span> <span data-start="1010.619" data-end="1016.709">to your undefine without the bar statement, so it's global, and (Without the Var statement</span> <span data-start="1016.709" data-end="1023.059">so it's global) and you should write void, for those that are not familiar with the void</span> <span data-start="1023.059" data-end="1031.65">operator, it would return  no matter what you have on the right side, and for the</span> <span data-start="1031.65" data-end="1038.579">interesting part of this implementation on the browser, the right part doesn't have to</span> <span data-start="1038.579" data-end="1047.209">be defined variable to that to work. So, you could write any Gibberish on the right side</span> <span data-start="1047.209" data-end="1054.71">and it would work any way that's kind of crazy. Another implementation that I want to try</span> <span data-start="1054.71" data-end="1062.76">was to polyfill the method option.create. And if you remember we didn't have functions</span> <span data-start="1062.76" data-end="1070.88">expressions so to create functions you need to use the function con instructor and Dimitri</span> <span data-start="1070.88" data-end="1077.82">audalso, for con instructor functions for functions and objects, it's the same if you</span> <span data-start="1077.82" data-end="1083.96">write the new or\h‑‑ the new or without new, it would behave the same. So I'm using</span> <span data-start="1083.96" data-end="1093.8">that. And what I'm trying to say with this is a lot of features that we use today could</span> <span data-start="1093.8" data-end="1104.16">have been used on the first version of JavaScript or Mocha. But, let's go back today and the</span> <span data-start="1104.16" data-end="1113.73">future of the next specification. Turns out there was a lot of changes since the committee</span> <span data-start="1113.73" data-end="1121.71">started working, and especially since they started working on ES6. I think they realized</span> <span data-start="1121.71" data-end="1127.51">that the web was moving so fast that they needed faster and more predictable release</span> <span data-start="1127.51" data-end="1135.65">processes. And that ended up in a train model adoption for releases, so right now, we should</span> <span data-start="1135.65" data-end="1145.93">have a release of the specification, hopefully, once a year. The next\h‑‑ the next change</span> <span data-start="1145.93" data-end="1152.13">that the committee had was the incorporation of members who are not representative of major</span> <span data-start="1152.13" data-end="1159.9">browser vendors, I think that's really great to have a really healthy committee and more</span> <span data-start="1159.9" data-end="1170.17">diverse. And the last important change was for the committee to be as open as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1170.17" data-end="1175.73">Not open in the sense that hey, I want to be part of TC 39, yeah, sure, come in, but</span> <span data-start="1175.73" data-end="1184.53">in the sense that all the proposals and all the meeting notes are available for anyone</span> <span data-start="1184.53" data-end="1196.12">to read. You can join the ES discuss mail or look at the\h‑‑ or look at GitHub.</span> <span data-start="1196.12" data-end="1205.88">They have really nice organization. Here are some research that I used to prepare my talk.</span> <span data-start="1205.88" data-end="1216.95">The last one, is a talk\h‑‑ summit this February, it was featured by many TC 39 contributors.</span> </p>
