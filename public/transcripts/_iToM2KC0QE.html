<p><span data-start="35.739" data-end="37.739">It's been pretty awesome.</span> <span data-start="37.739" data-end="43.469">So this talk, I'm going to be talking about my experiences with maintaining Babel.</span> <span data-start="43.469" data-end="46.559">And just a little intro for me.</span> <span data-start="46.559" data-end="55.289">My Twitter handle is left_pad and I maintain Babel and a bunch of open source projects.</span> <span data-start="55.289" data-end="61.6">I really like games, 7 Wonders.</span> <span data-start="61.6" data-end="63.839">I haven't played the Babel expansion yet.</span> <span data-start="63.839" data-end="65.78">But looking forward to it.</span> <span data-start="65.78" data-end="68.65">I also like Korean BBQ.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="68.65" data-end="74.58">I took Sean Larkin of Webpack, his first time in California.</span> <span data-start="74.58" data-end="78.21">And I'm addicted to open source.</span> <span data-start="78.21" data-end="82.6">This is just� I went to a restaurant in New York City and I just� that reminded</span> <span data-start="82.6" data-end="87.55">me of the GitHub contribution graph.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.55" data-end="92.26">So this talk isn't going to be about wanting to get people to contribute to open source</span> <span data-start="92.26" data-end="94.2">or becoming a maintainer.</span> <span data-start="94.2" data-end="97.77">Just to give you a picture of what it's like to be a maintainer.</span> <span data-start="97.77" data-end="101.86">Maybe give you some more awareness to what that's like.</span> <span data-start="101.86" data-end="105.409">So how did I get started in open source?</span> <span data-start="105.409" data-end="108.32">I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span data-start="108.32" data-end="112.06">And my first introduction to open source is through hackathons.</span> <span data-start="112.06" data-end="117.7">You know, the first project I made with JavaScript was just vanilla JS.</span> <span data-start="117.7" data-end="125.28">I didn't know about any libraries or things like Bootstrap or Angular.</span> <span data-start="125.28" data-end="132.42">Eventual I learned how to use, you know, npm and download libraries like D3.</span> <span data-start="132.42" data-end="137.609">My first pull request to GitHub was to the con academy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.609" data-end="141.93">And I used this Website called first PR to figure out what it was.</span> <span data-start="141.93" data-end="148.28">And I actually realized that it wasn't merged because I didn't know how to use read base.</span> <span data-start="148.28" data-end="150.2">I just had all these commits there.</span> <span data-start="150.2" data-end="156.84">When I first started working I met this guy called Jonathan Neal and he encouraged me</span> <span data-start="156.84" data-end="161.329">to get started in open source because I was using Angular at the time.</span> <span data-start="161.329" data-end="165.01">I tried to figure out how to get started.</span> <span data-start="165.01" data-end="167.39">I read all the contributing docs.</span> <span data-start="167.39" data-end="172.03">I read through all documentation again, I went through all the issues.</span> <span data-start="172.03" data-end="175.239">But it was really hard for me to find a place to get started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.239" data-end="180.9">Well, I found that there was an issue about updating the linting config.</span> <span data-start="180.9" data-end="182.739">Oh, just updating some JSON.</span> <span data-start="182.739" data-end="186.169">I went in, made a PR for that.</span> <span data-start="186.169" data-end="191.959">Except I found how it had to learn how to use npm shrink wrap and all this crazy stuff.</span> <span data-start="191.959" data-end="197.129">Eventual I ended up being the number 22 committer on Angular.</span> <span data-start="197.129" data-end="199.239">And that was only because I updated the styling.</span> <span data-start="199.239" data-end="202.37">I didn't do any core changes.</span> <span data-start="202.37" data-end="206.239">So all these changes were manually fixed by me.</span> <span data-start="206.239" data-end="209.139">Because we didn't have autofixing or anything like that.</span> <span data-start="209.139" data-end="214.889">And it was really cool because Igor, one of the maintainers, he even reached out and emailed</span> <span data-start="214.889" data-end="220.09">me and asked if I wanted to get a Tshirt.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.09" data-end="225.049">And then I wanted to contribute more to Angular, but then I realized I had no idea what was</span> <span data-start="225.049" data-end="226.989">going on in the code base.</span> <span data-start="226.989" data-end="232.129">I figured because I was working on the styling I should check out the project I was contributing</span> <span data-start="232.129" data-end="233.129">to.</span> <span data-start="233.129" data-end="237.79">And so I found JSCS, which is a linter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="237.79" data-end="242.53">And that repo was really cool because they had help wanted label.</span> <span data-start="242.53" data-end="244.489">And that was� it made it easy for me to contribute.</span> <span data-start="244.489" data-end="250.75">So my first PR to this project was just adding this table of contents.</span> <span data-start="250.75" data-end="255.68">Over time I ended up doing more things to this like bug fixes and new rules.</span> <span data-start="255.68" data-end="260.03">And eventual I got an email that said, oh, you can be on the core team, which is really</span> <span data-start="260.03" data-end="261.35">awesome.</span> <span data-start="261.35" data-end="267.87">And even better than that, a few months before that I actually got an email to work at Behance,</span> <span data-start="267.87" data-end="270.22">where two of the maintainers worked at.</span> <span data-start="270.22" data-end="272.13">So I moved to New York.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.13" data-end="277.88">Right now I work at Behance where I do JavaScript and work on Babel.</span> <span data-start="277.88" data-end="284.58">So how do I become a maintainer?</span> <span data-start="284.58" data-end="291.57">Basically� Sebastian was saying he was getting burnt out and he wanted to maintain that.</span> <span data-start="291.57" data-end="296.01">I found a different project and I was working on linter.</span> <span data-start="296.01" data-end="302.12">So it made sense, oh, I can figure out how to contribute to that.</span> <span data-start="302.12" data-end="309.09">And he wrote a blog post a while back talking about his problems with open source in the</span> <span data-start="309.09" data-end="312.92">community and getting burnt out.</span> <span data-start="312.92" data-end="317.17">And so, you know, he started working on it and all these contributors came in.</span> <span data-start="317.17" data-end="320.41">I just happened to be one of those people.</span> <span data-start="320.41" data-end="322.48">And� yeah.</span> <span data-start="322.48" data-end="326.72">And then I feel like I didn't even realize I was a maintainer until he basically told</span> <span data-start="326.72" data-end="330.13">me, like, you know, you slowly did more and more stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.13" data-end="331.641">So it just kind of creeps up on you.</span> <span data-start="331.641" data-end="336.14">And you realize, oh, I'm a maintainer now.</span> <span data-start="336.14" data-end="341.08">But the problem was that I felt like I was a contributor the whole time I was being a</span> <span data-start="341.08" data-end="345.91">maintainer, and that led me to only doing the things that I thought were easy.</span> <span data-start="345.91" data-end="349.93">So I would fix docs or may fix bugs.</span> <span data-start="349.93" data-end="354.45">I would never look into the code and figure out how to make core changes.</span> <span data-start="354.45" data-end="357.72">And it's funny because people were asking me all these questions, I didn't know the</span> <span data-start="357.72" data-end="358.72">answer either.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.72" data-end="361.06">I had to look it up and send a message.</span> <span data-start="361.06" data-end="362.06">Okay.</span> <span data-start="362.06" data-end="363.06">This is what it is.</span> <span data-start="363.06" data-end="366.79">But I guess nobody knew that I didn't really know what it was either.</span> <span data-start="366.79" data-end="369.67">[ Laughter ] Yeah.</span> <span data-start="369.67" data-end="373.5">So then that led me to think that the project wasn't moving forward.</span> <span data-start="373.5" data-end="379.11">All we're doing is maintaining what someone else already created.</span> <span data-start="379.11" data-end="384.34">And I felt like at any point that Sebastian would come back and tell me what to do or</span> <span data-start="384.34" data-end="386.39">what the vision of the project was.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="386.39" data-end="389.34">And only recently where I was like, oh, okay.</span> <span data-start="389.34" data-end="390.5">We are the maintainers.</span> <span data-start="390.5" data-end="396.99">We should figure out what the priorities are, what the roadmap is, how to move forward.</span> <span data-start="396.99" data-end="403.43">And a lot of that led to just thinking about, like, why do we do open source in the first</span> <span data-start="403.43" data-end="405.34">place?</span> <span data-start="405.34" data-end="408.68">When you get really involved in something, whether it's work or open source or anything</span> <span data-start="408.68" data-end="413.55">else, you know, we start thinking that's where we get our worth from.</span> <span data-start="413.55" data-end="421.36">When it doesn't go well, we start thinking, like, what are we working towards?</span> <span data-start="421.36" data-end="423.31">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="423.31" data-end="428.43">So this makes you think this everyone thinks that maintainer know everything.</span> <span data-start="428.43" data-end="429.62">And they have the answers to everything.</span> <span data-start="429.62" data-end="438.31">But we're just other developers that, you know, figured out how to look it up.</span> <span data-start="438.31" data-end="439.9">[ Laughter ] So yeah.</span> <span data-start="439.9" data-end="443.14">How do we actually measure success in open source?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="443.14" data-end="450.65">I think we glamorize all the downloads� we have like 8 million downloads a month and</span> <span data-start="450.65" data-end="452.33">all these stars.</span> <span data-start="452.33" data-end="456.37">But then at the same time, like, you know, there's one.</span> <span data-start="456.37" data-end="458.07">Everyone's using open source now.</span> <span data-start="458.07" data-end="461.32">But what was the cost of that, right?</span> <span data-start="461.32" data-end="465.44">We have all these people that are volunteering to, you know, spend their time working on</span> <span data-start="465.44" data-end="471.76">this thing for all these companies and people that, like, what are we actually getting out</span> <span data-start="471.76" data-end="473.25">of this?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="473.25" data-end="479.51">So it's like where I think that it's not just like the work that we put in, but how we do</span> <span data-start="479.51" data-end="480.51">it, right?</span> <span data-start="480.51" data-end="485.93">That I want to make sure that when we do ask people to join open source or become maintainers</span> <span data-start="485.93" data-end="490.9">that we figure out how to do it sustainably.</span> <span data-start="490.9" data-end="496.23">[ Laughter ] So I just am going to talk about a few stories.</span> <span data-start="496.23" data-end="498.97">So GitHub issues.</span> <span data-start="498.97" data-end="500.95">A lot of people use GitHub issues.</span> <span data-start="500.95" data-end="503.66">A lot of people switch off of GitHub issues.</span> <span data-start="503.66" data-end="510.09">We're probably the only project that switched and then went back to GitHub issues.</span> <span data-start="510.09" data-end="518.65">A while back Sebastian posted about how GitHub was not a good, you know, use for managing</span> <span data-start="518.65" data-end="519.73">issues.</span> <span data-start="519.73" data-end="523.77">And so we moved to this thing called Phabricator.</span> <span data-start="523.77" data-end="526.62">A lot of people complained about it.</span> <span data-start="526.62" data-end="529.19">Some of the positives.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="529.19" data-end="531.75">There was a lot less back and forth.</span> <span data-start="531.75" data-end="535.83">People had to say what version they were using, the input and output.</span> <span data-start="535.83" data-end="540.77">It was a lot easier to actually reproduce issues.</span> <span data-start="540.77" data-end="546.06">It also led�to more people talking in PRs because we had to disable the issues.</span> <span data-start="546.06" data-end="551.38">And they had a lot more features like merging certificates and reactions and all that stuff.</span> <span data-start="551.38" data-end="556.02">But it ended up being that there was a lot more negatives.</span> <span data-start="556.02" data-end="559.44">All the previous GitHub links are not available.</span> <span data-start="559.44" data-end="565.46">If you had a blog post link to GitHub, it fails.</span> <span data-start="565.46" data-end="569.44">If you're coming to the problem, where's the issues?</span> <span data-start="569.44" data-end="577.01">That led to people doing a lot of weird things like emailing me directly or making a comment</span> <span data-start="577.01" data-end="580.31">in the commit of the repo.</span> <span data-start="580.31" data-end="586.11">Or making issues on the Website repo rather than the actual repo.</span> <span data-start="586.11" data-end="589.44">It also led to less issues.</span> <span data-start="589.44" data-end="595.58">It feels like it's good, but I heard from a lot of people that they didn't even want</span> <span data-start="595.58" data-end="598.84">to do it because they didn't know how to use the interface.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="598.84" data-end="603.67">And also, over time, GitHub made a lot of improvements so that it felt reasonable to</span> <span data-start="603.67" data-end="606.05">move back.</span> <span data-start="606.05" data-end="612.49">So we had to make more code to convert all the issues to GitHub.</span> <span data-start="612.49" data-end="614.17">It was insane.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="614.17" data-end="616.08">I didn't do any of the work on this.</span> <span data-start="616.08" data-end="622.21">Daniel, one of the team members, he had to write all this code to turn SQL queries into</span> <span data-start="622.21" data-end="627.14">GitHub API calls and make sure it doesn't ping anybody, and make sure it redirects to</span> <span data-start="627.14" data-end="630.18">the new GitHub URLs.</span> <span data-start="630.18" data-end="640.39">We made a battle bot and it imported 772 repos and basically copy and pasted the issue contents.</span> <span data-start="640.39" data-end="643.12">And when we finally do this, everybody was excited.</span> <span data-start="643.12" data-end="645.6">Me too.</span> <span data-start="645.6" data-end="650.76">Because I had felt like in the other interface I started not looking at the issues either.</span> <span data-start="650.76" data-end="653.07">Stopped caring.</span> <span data-start="653.07" data-end="655.38">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="655.38" data-end="657.69">More frustration.</span> <span data-start="657.69" data-end="659.64">So npm packages.</span> <span data-start="659.64" data-end="663.17">We had Babel preset 2015.</span> <span data-start="663.17" data-end="665.19">And I was like, well, it's 2016 now.</span> <span data-start="665.19" data-end="668.2">So I guess I should make a Babel 2016.</span> <span data-start="668.2" data-end="670.73">And I found out that someone already made that.</span> <span data-start="670.73" data-end="675.55">But this person was really nice and they said it was their pleasure to let, you know�</span> <span data-start="675.55" data-end="677.65">give the package up to Babel.</span> <span data-start="677.65" data-end="681.18">And now I just thought, well, what about the next year?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681.18" data-end="684.65">And then I go to� and I found out somebody already made that too.</span> <span data-start="684.65" data-end="688.5">But then this person didn't really want to give up the name.</span> <span data-start="688.5" data-end="692.81">Which actually kind of hurts our project because it makes it sound like the package naming</span> <span data-start="692.81" data-end="694.88">was official.</span> <span data-start="694.88" data-end="696.48">And so that was like a long back and forth.</span> <span data-start="696.48" data-end="702.07">And like a month later we were able to get the project.</span> <span data-start="702.07" data-end="707.89">But the real solution is to use what npm has now with scopes so that everything under the</span> <span data-start="707.89" data-end="710.65">add Babel name would be official.</span> <span data-start="710.65" data-end="712.84">We haven't done that yet.</span> <span data-start="712.84" data-end="715.5">But we're looking into it.</span> <span data-start="715.5" data-end="721.89">And the next thing would be that we should just stop making preset ES2000 specs because</span> <span data-start="721.89" data-end="725.18">then we'll have a hundred config values.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="725.18" data-end="735.33">And it looks like people who know what the packages are willing to try it out.</span> <span data-start="735.33" data-end="739.44">Okay.</span> <span data-start="739.44" data-end="745.029">So I think some of you might have seen this blog post.</span> <span data-start="745.029" data-end="749.44">And in it Jordan talks about how Babel has this picture of�</span> <span data-start="749.44" data-end="750.91">[ Laughter ] Guy Fieri in it.</span> </p>
