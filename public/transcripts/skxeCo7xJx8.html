to</span> <span data-start="387.3" data-end="389.87">start with this going over what the VR</span> <span data-start="389.87" data-end="392.7">ecosystem today looks like so first we</span> <span data-start="392.7" data-end="396.72">have probably the most common mobile VR</span> <span data-start="396.72" data-end="399.919">device type available and this is</span> <span data-start="399.919" data-end="402.72">powered by a smartphone it's a device</span> <span data-start="402.72" data-end="405.75">that is essentially allowing your server</span> <span data-start="405.75"

I</span> <span data-start="417.43" data-end="419.23">ask that question at a talk that number</span> <span data-start="419.23" data-end="420.52">goes up which makes me personally really</span> <span

data-end="428.37">how the industry is growing and evolving</span> <span data-start="428.37" data-end="431.5">so mobile VR like i mentioned allows</span> <span data-start="431.5" data-end="435.18">your

are</span> <span data-start="438.61" data-end="440.02">running are just generally simple</span> <span data-start="440.02" data-end="441.79">smartphone applications you have a</span> <span

data-end="447.55">so it's tracking kind of where you're</span> <span data-start="447.55" data-end="449.32">moving feels very natural and updates</span> <span data-start="449.32" data-end="450.88">the

capable of</span> <span data-start="455.11" data-end="456.67">running in something like a desktop via</span> <span data-start="456.67" data-end="459.31">our device with desktop ER devices</span> <span data-start="459.31" data-end="461.77">you're generally running standard PC</span> <span data-start="461.77" data-end="463.87">applications your head mounted display</span> <span data-start="463.87" data-end="466.03">is entirely separate you're not powering</span> <span data-start="466.03" data-end="467.8">this from the device itself you're</span> <span data-start="467.8" data-end="469.48">powering it from an external computer</span> <span data-start="469.48" data-end="471.07">which generally means that you're</span> <span data-start="471.07" data-end="473.26">tethered

of your</span> <span data-start="477.04" data-end="478.33">head and where you're looking but you</span> <span data-start="478.33" data-end="481.69">also have a number of other potential</span> <span data-start="481.69" data-end="483.67">devices like seeing here you could have</span> <span data-start="483.67" data-end="485.23">hand tracked controllers you could have</span> <span

data-end="501.46">this is very very kind of like broadly</span> <span data-start="501.46" data-end="503.38">separating VR devices into these three</span> <span data-start="503.38"

data-end="1556.42">reality are blending together even at</span> <span data-start="1556.42" data-end="1557.89">this early stage there are custom</span> <span data-start="1557.89"

data-end="1577.48">within another virtual environment you</span> <span data-start="1577.48" data-end="1579.3">start to get at a very inception level</span> <span data-start="1579.3" data-end="1582.79">kind of thing we're really at the</span> <span data-start="1582.79" data-end="1585.13">beginning like the potential with all of</span> <span data-start="1585.13"

data-end="1598.51">decades into immersive content brings</span> <span data-start="1598.51" data-end="1600.91">with it a lot of capabilities and a lot</span> <span data-start="1600.91" data-end="1603.4">of potential for very very interesting</span> <span data-start="1603.4" data-end="1606.13">applications in the future of course</span> <span data-start="1606.13" data-end="1608.14">there are always challenges with things</span> <span data-start="1608.14" data-end="1610.15">like this bringing browser performance</span> <span data-start="1610.15" data-end="1613.6">with 3d content on par with native</span> <span data-start="1613.6" data-end="1615.16">applications and around framerate</span> <span data-start="1615.16" data-end="1616.75">latency it's a little bit of a challenge</span> <span data-start="1616.75" data-end="1618.4">but I've seen some really compelling</span> <span data-start="1618.4" data-end="1620.47">examples of people hitting 90 frames per</span> <span data-start="1620.47" data-end="1622.44">second and some of these experimental</span> <span data-start="1622.44" data-end="1624.34">browsers and custom builds of</span> <span data-start="1624.34" data-end="1625.99">development browsers so we're getting</span> <span data-start="1625.99" data-end="1627.37">there and it's definitely something</span> <span data-start="1627.37" data-end="1630.34">that's going to be feasible when you</span> <span data-start="1630.34" data-end="1631.48">start looking at different types of</span> <span data-start="1631.48" data-end="1632.98">applications and of course the content</span> <span data-start="1632.98" data-end="1634.3">that you're building is going to depend</span> <span data-start="1634.3" data-end="1636.34">a lot on the requirements for your</span> <span data-start="1636.34" data-end="1639.07">performance in the first example if</span> <span data-start="1639.07" data-end="1641.83">you're building an Excel chart you're</span> <span data-start="1641.83" data-end="1643.06">viewing an Excel chart without a lot of</span> <span data-start="1643.06" data-end="1644.59">heavy animations that's going to be a</span> <span data-start="1644.59" data-end="1646">lot different performance wise in the</span> <span data-start="1646" data-end="1647.58">browser than something like their full</span> <span data-start="1647.58" data-end="1650.71">3d 360 degree game that you're watching</span> <span data-start="1650.71"

now a lot of the considerations</span> <span data-start="1657.54" data-end="1660.3">around building a web view our site come</span> <span data-start="1660.3" data-end="1662.94">less around technical decisions that you</span> <span data-start="1662.94" data-end="1664.05">may have to make but more around the</span> <span data-start="1664.05" data-end="1666.09">design considerations if you're wearing</span> <span data-start="1666.09" data-end="1669.39">a headset with a phone in it you're</span> <span data-start="1669.39" data-end="1671.61">going to have a different number of you</span> <span data-start="1671.61" data-end="1673.38">know interactions that are available to</span> <span data-start="1673.38" data-end="1674.61">you then if you're using something like</span> <span

data-end="1686.52">experiences in the browser is something</span> <span data-start="1686.52" data-end="1688.62">that is also again kind of being worked</span> <span data-start="1688.62" data-end="1689.85">on right now but it's at early stages</span> <span data-start="1689.85" data-end="1692.76">it's really challenging sometimes to</span> <span data-start="1692.76" data-end="1694.56">right things and knowing kind of what</span> <span data-start="1694.56" data-end="1696.39">the 3d coordinate system in the headsets</span> <span data-start="1696.39" data-end="1698.22">going to look like if I'm writing that</span> <span data-start="1698.22" data-end="1700.65">all in texts so if I know you know the</span> <span data-start="1700.65" data-end="1702.48">z-axis could be in front or behind me</span> <span data-start="1702.48" data-end="1704.19">where do I put things if I can't see</span> <span data-start="1704.19"

data-end="1709.29">of sense but we're starting to see more</span> <span data-start="1709.29" data-end="1710.73">and more opportunities where you don't</span> <span data-start="1710.73" data-end="1712.68">just have visual editing tools on the</span> <span data-start="1712.68" data-end="1714.24">monitor in front of you but you also get</span> <span data-start="1714.24"
