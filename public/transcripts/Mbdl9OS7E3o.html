<p><span data-start="8.029" data-end="14.8">I have been participating and maintaining in an open source project, Mocha</span> <span data-start="15.031" data-end="17.916">and I'm here to share some of the things I've learned.</span> <span data-start="19.196" data-end="22">I think you all roughly know about Mocha</span> <span data-start="22.001" data-end="24.166">To briefly explain about Mocha,</span> <span data-start="24.167" data-end="26.6">Mocha is a Javascript test frame work</span> <span data-start="26.601" data-end="31.518">It's a framework that can be used on both Node.js and web browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="31.565" data-end="35.899">It's been out for a while now, so it was developed with the early Node.</span> <span data-start="35.9" data-end="39.5">It's a project that grew with Node ecology.</span> <span data-start="40.934" data-end="43.221">This is the State of JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="43.222" data-end="46.743">a website that surveys about the ecosystem of Javascript every year.</span> <span data-start="46.744" data-end="50.268">Last year, Jest was used the most</span> <span data-start="50.269" data-end="52.646">and Mocha was second place.</span> <span data-start="52.657" data-end="55.5">In my memory, before then, Mocha was used the most</span> <span data-start="55.6" data-end="58.629">but Jest arose to the top last year.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="58.8" data-end="62.3">Seen from the back, the colors may not be distinguishable.</span> <span data-start="62.301" data-end="64.498">Red is 'Have used</span> <span data-start="64.5" data-end="66.5">and is willing to use in the future.'</span> <span data-start="66.6" data-end="70.977">Blue is 'Have heard of it and is willing to try it in the future.'</span> <span data-start="71.085" data-end="73.39">Grey is 'Never heard of it.'</span> <span data-start="73.61" data-end="75.5">It's distinguished like that.</span> <span data-start="76.05" data-end="79.737">When I checked on the weekends,</span> <span data-start="80.11" data-end="83.682">Based on GitHub, about 870,000 projects were used.</span> <span data-start="85.137" data-end="88.979">There are about 18,000 stars recorded.</span> <span data-start="89" data-end="92.275">To start my talk,</span> <span data-start="92.316" data-end="96.5">I think I should talk about how I joined as a maintainer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="96.6" data-end="98.9">I think a lot of you would be curious about that.</span> <span data-start="99.824" data-end="102.8">It was last year, March 6th.</span> <span data-start="102.9" data-end="105.9">On March 6th, I first joined the Mocha organization</span> <span data-start="106" data-end="108.5">I got a call from the lead maintainer.</span> <span data-start="108.6" data-end="110.8">The maintainer called me to work together and I agreed.</span> <span data-start="110.9" data-end="113.377">When I joined,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="114.29" data-end="118.499">This is the 2017s and the early 2018s, when I first went in,</span> <span data-start="118.5" data-end="120.2">this was my GitHub contribution graph.</span> <span data-start="120.3" data-end="125.626">As you can see, from January of 2018 and onwards, the contribution is completely different.</span> <span data-start="125.647" data-end="128.839">I was working hard on gardening.</span> <span data-start="129.425" data-end="133.521">The reason why I could do this is because I resigned at the end of 2017.</span> <span data-start="133.6" data-end="139.576">I resigned at the end of the year and it was hard to transfer companies at the end or the beginning of the year.</span> <span data-start="139.596" data-end="143.014">No one was recruiting, so I was thinking of taking some time off work for 2~3 months.</span> <span data-start="143.363" data-end="146.806">But I couldn't waste 2~3 months.</span> <span data-start="147.001" data-end="149.759">So I studied and did other things but</span> <span data-start="150.018" data-end="155.217">I wanted to contribute to open source</span> <span data-start="155.74" data-end="157.9">So that is how the graph I just showed you was made.</span> <span data-start="158.295" data-end="164.183">So, I was searching for issues on projects I was using, which includes Mocha,</span> <span data-start="164.305" data-end="167.366">I had been using Mocha for a long time and Mocha was one of the subjects.</span> <span data-start="168.716" data-end="172.854">Of course, before this, I was uploading PRs from time to time.</span> <span data-start="172.855" data-end="175.11">So before I joined,</span> <span data-start="175.542" data-end="178">from 2011 to 2018,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="178.001" data-end="182.309">I contributed seven commits to Mocha.</span> <span data-start="182.31" data-end="184.878">And among them, five were done between January and February.</span> <span data-start="184.879" data-end="187.426">Before that, I did simple ones.</span> <span data-start="187.5" data-end="190.428">I made five commits in January to February and uploaded my PR.</span> <span data-start="191.75" data-end="196.755">And I joined after getting a call, and when I got in,</span> <span data-start="196.756" data-end="203.996">it was the time they increased the number of maintainers, I think.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.372" data-end="207.875">That's something hard to know from the outside. Getting inside and looking at the projects,</span> <span data-start="207.9" data-end="211.3">I feel that that was the period, and working together,</span> <span data-start="212.4" data-end="216.5">Mocha is a community based, open source project</span> <span data-start="216.505" data-end="218.98">When I say it's based on community,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="219.314" data-end="222.89">I mean we don't have a full time maintainer</span> <span data-start="222.891" data-end="225">We all have our own jobs and schedules.</span> <span data-start="225.1" data-end="229.57">The majority of people maintain Mocha after getting off work.</span> <span data-start="229.737" data-end="233.6">For a vendor supported project, like React</span> <span data-start="233.897" data-end="237.5">In this case, Facebook gives them lots of money</span> <span data-start="237.617" data-end="240.729">and hires full-time developers.</span> <span data-start="241.178" data-end="243.689">So I think the process would differ.</span> <span data-start="243.69" data-end="245.499">I haven't participated in that kind of thing myself.</span> <span data-start="246.5" data-end="251.072">And of course, just because it's community based,</span> <span data-start="251.073" data-end="253.697">doesn't mean there isn't a full-time open source developer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.697" data-end="256">I was just talking about Mocha's situation.</span> <span data-start="256.1" data-end="258.3">Namely, Babel, for example,</span> <span data-start="258.38" data-end="261.2">Henry is the full-time lead maintainer.</span> <span data-start="261.457" data-end="262.591">So open source development.</span> <span data-start="264.134" data-end="265.624">is usually done like this.</span> <span data-start="265.704" data-end="269.546">I said I made about five commits in a short time, during January and February.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="269.547" data-end="271.199">I uploaded five PRs.</span> <span data-start="271.944" data-end="276.081">But working within a short time, becoming an insider and seeing the PRs,</span> <span data-start="276.082" data-end="278.14">you start to notice some people that come around often.</span> <span data-start="278.376" data-end="281.7">There are too many people who come once or twice.</span> <span data-start="281.701" data-end="284.257">So they aren't that memorable.</span> <span data-start="284.376" data-end="288.706">But people who come 3,4 or 4,5 times in a short time,</span> <span data-start="288.707" data-end="292.222">or who leave comments through PR are memorable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="292.4" data-end="295.806">And when the company is at a time to hire more maintainers,</span> <span data-start="295.967" data-end="300.278">we call those people, give out offers and they join us.</span> <span data-start="300.319" data-end="303.236">There were about two people who joined like that after me.</span> <span data-start="304.154" data-end="306.2">Since it's community based,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.355" data-end="309.936">The members aren't fixed. There are about 10 people in our core team.</span> <span data-start="310.347" data-end="314.1">I've never met about 3 or 4 of them.</span> <span data-start="314.101" data-end="315.681">I haven't ever seen them since I joined.</span> <span data-start="315.956" data-end="320.507">There are people who were active last year but aren't as present this year.</span> <span data-start="320.663" data-end="321.971">That's kind of how it works.</span> <span data-start="321.972" data-end="324.8">And if the number of core members seems to reduce,</span> <span data-start="324.9" data-end="327.7">and if someone seems to be working more actively,</span> <span data-start="327.8" data-end="332.276">we call that person to join. That's how stuff runs.</span> <span data-start="333.797" data-end="336.614">So when I first joined, I had big dreams.</span> <span data-start="336.615" data-end="341.258">Unlike before, when I uploaded GitHub as a individual side project,</span> <span data-start="341.259" data-end="344.559">This is a projects that everyone knows.</span> <span data-start="344.56" data-end="346.853">And there are skilled developers.</span> <span data-start="346.853" data-end="348.66">Working with these people,</span> <span data-start="348.701" data-end="350.972">how much would I learn from them? Or what would I be able to do?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.973" data-end="353.393">I fantasized about these questions.</span> <span data-start="353.946" data-end="356.949">Then a year has passed now. About a year and a half passed.</span> <span data-start="357.344" data-end="360.846">The thing that struck me the most is that maintainers are busy. They are so busy.</span> <span data-start="361.085" data-end="362.6">There is too much work for the maintainers.</span> <span data-start="363.716" data-end="366.099">I worked on open source projects before.</span> <span data-start="366.1" data-end="368.5">My side project became an open source project</span> <span data-start="368.501" data-end="372.248">and I got PRs and issues.</span> <span data-start="372.3" data-end="376.487">I talked with people and had that experience for several years.</span> <span data-start="376.68" data-end="380.095">So I thought I knew how this all works.</span> <span data-start="380.683" data-end="383.047">So last year, in the ecosystem of open source,</span> <span data-start="383.162" data-end="387.829">as a member of that ecosystem, I made a presentation on what developers must do</span> <span data-start="387.83" data-end="390.03">elsewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="390.031" data-end="394.515">At the time, of course, I talked about how busy maintainers are.</span> <span data-start="394.753" data-end="396.595">But after actually experiencing the life myself, I realize that's it's way more hectic.</span> <span data-start="396.596" data-end="403.2">It's too busy. I get the feeling that I really have to pay attention and focus on working on open source</span> <span data-start="404.212" data-end="408.033">So, looking at one example, there's a notification function on Github.</span> <span data-start="408.133" data-end="410.58">So, Github notifications will keep coming to me.</span> <span data-start="410.581" data-end="413.573">I don't know if you can see well from the back.</span> <span data-start="413.574" data-end="416.532">In the case of Mocha, I get about 2~3 each day.</span> <span data-start="416.533" data-end="418.571">When theres a lot, 4 or 5.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.576" data-end="422.918">Mocha is not that big of a project, so it doesn't get that many.</span> <span data-start="423.015" data-end="429.292">If you're curious about really large projects, watch React or Node,</span> <span data-start="429.377" data-end="433.037">you will be able to see how many notifications are sent each day.</span> <span data-start="433.641" data-end="435.333">Mocha is not at that level.</span> <span data-start="435.433" data-end="441.686">These notifications come, 2 or 3 per day. If I take a break for a day or two or eat out,</span> <span data-start="441.807" data-end="444.884">then I'll miss the notifications and they will pile up.</span> <span data-start="445.499" data-end="449.3">It will pile up everyday, and I will have to take a look at all of them after work.</span> <span data-start="449.5" data-end="452.918">So, at the end of the day I think I should work on Mocha, and go in and press the notifications.</span> <span data-start="452.919" data-end="456.033">These are some stuff, it's just an example.</span> <span data-start="457.377" data-end="458.813">And I will go through them.</span> <span data-start="458.893" data-end="463.921">What problem this person has, why she raised this issue, and what she's saying,</span> <span data-start="463.922" data-end="466.932">How the code example is constructed, what the difficulty is,</span> <span data-start="466.933" data-end="470.539">I try to identify all the details, and then start to label them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="470.757" data-end="475.354">I do the labeling, and the reason for labeling is for other people, other maintainers,</span> <span data-start="475.355" data-end="478.331">or other people who contribute to Mocha</span> <span data-start="478.354" data-end="481.415">to better identify what the issue is.</span> <span data-start="481.476" data-end="484.796">Labeling involves categorizing, if the case is</span> <span data-start="484.947" data-end="486.83">a browser issue, or a node issue,</span> <span data-start="486.831" data-end="491.149">or it can be more detailed,</span> <span data-start="491.15" data-end="495.188">such as whether it needed additional information, if it confirmed a bug, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="496.111" data-end="499.533">And for those issues that can be resolved, I leave comments.</span> <span data-start="499.533" data-end="500.933">For issues that I have an opinion on, I leave comments.</span> <span data-start="500.935" data-end="506.271">For this case, displayed here on the screen, I left a comment and closed the issue.</span> <span data-start="506.672" data-end="509.759">In this case, the person who raised the issue</span> <span data-start="511.896" data-end="515.361">wasn't familiar with Node, and thus was not aware of the appropriate usage method.</span> <span data-start="515.363" data-end="520.508">So he uploaded it as a Mocha issue, but it turned out that he was using Node incorrectly</span> <span data-start="521.293" data-end="527.109">The comment here is just one sentence, and a single line of code,</span> <span data-start="527.329" data-end="530.872">but when I upload this, I have to read the whole post</span> <span data-start="531.244" data-end="535.198">and then find out what the problem is from the example codes and stuff,</span> <span data-start="535.199" data-end="537.915">so I have to try and figure out the answer myself in order to post it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="537.995" data-end="540.332">I can answer really simple ones right away,</span> <span data-start="540.333" data-end="542.333">but for most of the posts, I have to execute and try them myself at least.</span> <span data-start="542.433" data-end="546.232">Also, because Mocha is a test framework, some people would run tests called Karma,</span> <span data-start="546.233" data-end="549.433">and others would use Babel or Webpack, which may get the system tangled up.</span> <span data-start="549.434" data-end="552.332">If things like those come up, I have to run various tests.</span> <span data-start="553.016" data-end="555.901">Then, it would take about 20~30 minutes minimum to look into a single issue.</span> <span data-start="555.902" data-end="558.633">It may take up to 1 or 2 hours, if it takes longer.</span> <span data-start="561.22" data-end="566.346">So, in order to save time, if maintainers don't have enough information,</span> <span data-start="566.347" data-end="568.833">they request MCVE.</span> <span data-start="568.833" data-end="571.033">Or they request additional information.</span> <span data-start="572.167" data-end="574.132">We cannot actually test every single thing.</span> <span data-start="574.133" data-end="577.533">I try to imagine what I need, and if I think something is lacking, I would request it.</span> <span data-start="577.534" data-end="579.833">What MCVE is,</span> <span data-start="579.933" data-end="582.433">there's a guide document for Stack Overflow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.533" data-end="586.233">An example which has a certain degree of completeness and is verifiable is called</span> <span data-start="586.234" data-end="587.341">MCVE.</span> <span data-start="588.384" data-end="590.684">When people ask questions, or raise issues, it's all the same thing.</span> <span data-start="590.801" data-end="594.098">Companies' codes are massive. Various code are intertwined.</span> <span data-start="594.099" data-end="599.161">So if we provide an example which can, at minimum, completely control the problem,</span> <span data-start="599.4" data-end="602.124">maintainers would know by executing it right after downloading it.</span> <span data-start="602.28" data-end="607.171">Most of the times, if that much information is provided, they would probably know without downloading it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="607.185" data-end="608.833">It can really save some time.</span> <span data-start="609.997" data-end="612.262">And from the list of notifications,</span> <span data-start="612.263" data-end="615.295">if it's a PR case, I have to conduct code review.</span> <span data-start="615.296" data-end="618.217">Often, code reviews have issues. So, I look at the history of</span> <span data-start="618.218" data-end="620.956">issues, and identify what the original issues were.</span> <span data-start="621.009" data-end="623.914">I look at the contents of the discussion, and come back to the PR.</span> <span data-start="623.915" data-end="626.135">From the PR pull request,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="627.117" data-end="629.617">I read to find out what the person intended to edit,</span> <span data-start="629.618" data-end="632.314">look at it along with the code, and provide an opinion.</span> <span data-start="632.433" data-end="636.376">Whether I agree, if something is incorrect, or if something is missing, etc.</span> <span data-start="636.561" data-end="640.133">I'm not just a person who writes comments, so I have to write code as well.</span> <span data-start="640.449" data-end="641.637">I have to write my code as well.</span> <span data-start="642.777" data-end="647.279">This is the most time consuming. Because I have to look for an issue, and resolve it.</span> <span data-start="648.092" data-end="650.967">Contributors also have discussions among themselves.</span> <span data-start="651.067" data-end="653.951">If there's an issue not being allocated, or road map meetings, and so on.</span> <span data-start="653.952" data-end="658.363">We discuss through chats about releases, or other questions we may have.</span> <span data-start="658.706" data-end="660.989">This happens on a daily, weekly basis.</span> <span data-start="661.282" data-end="665.351">In my opinion, I would have to spend 2 to 3 hours a day after work</span> <span data-start="665.433" data-end="668.533">in order to keep up with the pace.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="668.633" data-end="671.779">If I miss a day, then I would have more burden later on.</span> <span data-start="674.075" data-end="680.563">So actually, this may be an answer to the question 'Why doesn't my PR get merged?'</span> <span data-start="680.564" data-end="682.855">'Why doesn't anyone answer my issue?'</span> <span data-start="683.689" data-end="686.909">'Why is nobody interested?' It's just that everyone is so busy</span> <span data-start="686.91" data-end="688.008">that not all issues can be looked at.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="688.456" data-end="690.632">Not only that maintainers don't have the obligation to look at all issues,</span> <span data-start="690.633" data-end="693.245">but they just can't.
