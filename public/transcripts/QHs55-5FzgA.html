<p><span data-start="20.9" data-end="34.89">Thanks. All right. So, my name is Dmitry, and I am a JavaScript developer. And I guess</span> <span data-start="34.89" data-end="40.889">— who is not JavaScript developer here? There are a few actually. What are you doing</span> <span data-start="40.889" data-end="49.549">here? (Laughing) Well, the JavaScript is kind of funny language, and we all know this, and</span> <span data-start="49.549" data-end="54.789">we all know the quirks and tricks. And there's plenty of presentations with people just showing</span> <span data-start="54.789" data-end="60.749">some cool JavaScript features and then saying like, Look, you need to know that. I know</span> <span data-start="60.749" data-end="65.59">since I’m smarter than you. And all these talks are kind over boring because they're</span> <span data-start="65.59" data-end="78">not kind of useful. My talk will be sort of similar (Laughing), but I want to give a big</span> <span data-start="78" data-end="84.909">message. The history of the software, which was how I come with the idea of talking about</span> <span data-start="84.909" data-end="89.81">this stuff, is I had a conversation with a friend of mine and we were looking at some</span> <span data-start="89.81" data-end="94.7">code from different people and he said, Look, you can always see if some JavaScript developer</span> <span data-start="94.7" data-end="101.71">wrote some JavaScript\hcode. It's very visible, right? Or PHP developer. And I asked him,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="101.71" data-end="106.829">So what do you think, how is Java code written by JavaScript developer will look like? And</span> <span data-start="106.829" data-end="113.34">it made him think and made me think. How is JavaScript code written by JavaScript developer</span> <span data-start="113.34" data-end="120.34">would look like? What is the pure JavaScript style? We all know, we all came to JavaScript</span> <span data-start="120.34" data-end="125.659">from different backgrounds and me, personally, I was, like many, studying Basic, Clascall</span> <span data-start="125.659" data-end="130.619">###check### C++ and then jump to JavaScript, and obviously when I came to JavaScript, I</span> <span data-start="130.619" data-end="136.92">had a very good understanding of how the code should be written and I was completely wrong.</span> <span data-start="136.92" data-end="143.09">And JavaScript hit me in the back many, many times before I finally understood. And even</span> <span data-start="143.09" data-end="148.519">now, I'm not sure I understand JavaScript completely. Who actually think they know JavaScript</span> <span data-start="148.519" data-end="157.95">very well? Okay, a couple misguided people, (Laughing) that's good. But most people actually</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="169.56">not so confident, which is, I mean, maybe a good thing. So, what I want you to think,</span> <span data-start="169.56" data-end="177.64">just stop for a moment, forget about React and Angular and think about pure JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="177.64" data-end="184.09">What should it be like? What is the proper way? JavaScript is very flexible as we all</span> <span data-start="184.09" data-end="189.03">know, we can all write it in many different ways. And I'm not here to teach you how to</span> <span data-start="189.03" data-end="194.709">write JavaScript the right way. There is no right way. That's why there is the Zen of</span> <span data-start="194.709" data-end="199.129">JavaScript. JavaScript is a very Zen‑based language. Sometimes I think the\hBrandan Eich</span> <span data-start="199.129" data-end="211.579">is actually a Zen monk in this guise because it's crazy, right. So, I like to say that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.579" data-end="220.04">JavaScript is a Bruce Lee of JavaScript language, of programming languages because it's flexible.</span> <span data-start="220.04" data-end="230.53">It's powerful. And it changed the whole picture. I hope he wouldn't die young. And, I like</span> <span data-start="230.53" data-end="237.14">this quote of Bruce Lee, and I want to sort of point you to some of the things in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="237.14" data-end="246.29">which you maybe haven't seen before and maybe didn't think about this from this direction.</span> <span data-start="246.29" data-end="253.48">So this is a very popular concept of Zen Buddhism: What is the sound of one hand clapping? The</span> <span data-start="253.48" data-end="261.019">answer (snaps fingers) like this is a smartass answer is not the correct one. There is lots</span> <span data-start="261.019" data-end="267.95">of emptiness concept in the Zen. And there's lots of emptiness concept hidden in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="267.95" data-end="274.61">and I want to show you some of them. Of course, obvious answer when you come into these questions,</span> <span data-start="274.61" data-end="282.86">what is the number which is not a number? So let's assume you have a function, something</span> <span data-start="282.86" data-end="290.14">like that, something simple. You passed me a number and range and if it's inside this</span> <span data-start="290.14" data-end="294.83">range, I return you this number, if it's not, I return you\h‑‑ well basically people</span> <span data-start="294.83" data-end="303.12">put\h‑‑ if I don't know what to return, I return null. And then you check, like oh,</span> <span data-start="303.12" data-end="307.32">if this is isn’t reg null equals null, do something, do something, but it will be much</span> <span data-start="307.32" data-end="314.81">more JavaScript way, I would say, if this function will return you NaN; people are afraid</span> <span data-start="314.81" data-end="322.31">to use NaN. I've never seen anyone embrace NaN in their code. I assume it’s because</span> <span data-start="322.31" data-end="326.97">that when people met NaN, the first time when you know concatenate the string and you have</span> <span data-start="326.97" data-end="331.38">a suddenly you have this NaN, NaN, NaN on the screen and you're like, Oh, shit, this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="331.38" data-end="336.62">NaN again. And then everytime you see Nan, you’re like, Oh! I don't want to see this</span> <span data-start="336.62" data-end="346.09">thing, it doesn't exist. (Chuckles) Now if I close my eyes it will disappear. What if</span> <span data-start="346.09" data-end="352.31">— NaN exists, I'm sorry, it does exist. And it's actually a cool feature, right. What</span> <span data-start="352.31" data-end="358.91">is cool about NaN is that you can have multiple functions which work with numbers and they</span> <span data-start="358.91" data-end="364.44">use each other together and instead of rejoining now or something then check if something,</span> <span data-start="364.44" data-end="368.66">you can just return NaN, keep going, keep going, still number, still number, but at</span> <span data-start="368.66" data-end="373.38">the end it will be NaN if anything was wrong. You just don't need to worry about this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.38" data-end="381.02">It's kind of useful. I've never ever seen somebody actually typing NaN, like in their</span> <span data-start="381.02" data-end="389.25">code, because, because, I don't know because why. Why you didn't use NaN? You don't know.</span> <span data-start="389.25" data-end="395.25">Nobody does. I think it's\h‑‑ this is one of the JavaScript way, the NaN exists</span> <span data-start="395.25" data-end="399.55">there for a reason, so maybe you shouldn't be afraid of it, maybe you should think how</span> <span data-start="399.55" data-end="405.78">you can actually embrace it, it's there. It's like, you know, living in a four bedroom apartment</span> <span data-start="405.78" data-end="414.9">with two bedrooms locked. And just, you know .. you can do that. Why? Maybe you don't</span> <span data-start="414.9" data-end="425.74">there are doors. Maybe .. I don't know. Let's talk about equality. It's a favorite topic</span> <span data-start="425.74" data-end="433.19">for everybody, right. Favorite operator in JavaScript. Everybody loves it. It's crazy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="433.19" data-end="441.9">Douglass Trockford\h###Check### likes it most of all. So what is with double equals? So</span> <span data-start="441.9" data-end="449.58">object double equals true. No,\hobject double equals false? No. Like, what the heck? It</span> <span data-start="449.58" data-end="454.93">doesn't make any sense. Well, no, it's how things are. But if you have object which has</span> <span data-start="454.93" data-end="462.14">value of, then suddenly it could be equal to false or to true. So it's not always not</span> <span data-start="462.14" data-end="469.61">equal to true and false. And,\h### arrays equals to false, right, and obviously NaN</span> <span data-start="469.61" data-end="475.53">is equal to NaN. And when you look at this, this is crazy, this is madness, this is not</span> <span data-start="475.53" data-end="481.53">right, and I will never know how it will all work, so rather, I will use triple equals</span> <span data-start="481.53" data-end="487.4">and be safe. And this is the right way. And I use triple equals all the time, no matter</span> <span data-start="487.4" data-end="494.66">what, and I'll be happy. This is not the Zen way, this is not the JavaScript way. Why?</span> <span data-start="494.66" data-end="500.93">Because what about these guys? You're not going to use them as well? Because they behave</span> <span data-start="500.93" data-end="512">pretty much the same. Let's look at this one as a separate example. This is still true.</span> <span data-start="512" data-end="518.279">This is still true. So using triple equal wouldn't really save you from the problems.</span> <span data-start="518.279" data-end="525.66">It will just delay the day when you will face it, and you will say, Holy crap, what is this?</span> <span data-start="525.66" data-end="533.93">How it works? So some people could say, well, it's with less than it's much easier, because</span> <span data-start="533.93" data-end="537.839">it kind of work with numbers, so basically converts everything to number, and then does</span> <span data-start="537.839" data-end="542.92">a comparison, and then it all makes sense objects converted to numbers and NaN, so NaN</span> <span data-start="542.92" data-end="549.709">is not equal to true, not equal to false, and true and false become zero, one and everything</span> <span data-start="549.709" data-end="554.05">else is kind of holding space, everything good. I will just remember this works just</span> <span data-start="554.05" data-end="563.769">like numbers; all good. Not really. So if you have object, and you put object less than</span> <span data-start="563.769" data-end="568.949">or equal to object, it will be true, because object equal to itself, so it's not really</span> <span data-start="568.949" data-end="579.62">converted to number. What is my point? Well, maybe my point is learn the language and instead</span> <span data-start="579.62" data-end="587.37">of trying to avoid problems try to go through, accept it, embrace it, take it, learn it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="587.37" data-end="593.06">You're writing this language anyways. See avoiding the problems not works all the time.</span> <span data-start="593.06" data-end="599.629">So you can avoid the with operator, you can. Avoiding double equal with triple equals,</span> <span data-start="599.629" data-end="613.81">it's a false path of, you know, later disappointment. Don't disappoint yourself and me. So talking</span> <span data-start="613.81" data-end="623.529">about acceptance. It's really great to look at some of the native functions, which inside</span> <span data-start="623.529" data-end="630.839">Vanilla GS and look how they behave. And the API of JavaScript is actually pretty great.</span> <span data-start="630.839" data-end="636.899">And I actually surprised that when people writing their own APIs for the libraries and</span> <span data-start="636.899" data-end="643.42">stuff, for some reason they\h‑‑ instead of copying the JavaScript, they try to copy,</span> <span data-start="643.42" data-end="649.009">I don’t know, some other languages, some other concepts, some other things. JavaScript</span> <span data-start="649.009" data-end="655.43">is very pretty. My favorite function is Jar add, don't ask me why, I just like it. What</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="655.43" data-end="661.759">I like about Jar add. Don’t ask me why. I just like it. What I like about Jar add</span> <span data-start="661.759" data-end="668.019">it's very acceptable. It accepts anything, you can pass any shit inside, it will give</span> <span data-start="668.019" data-end="674.31">you the answer (Laughing). No matter what, it will just\h‑‑ yeah, whatever, I don't</span> <span data-start="674.31" data-end="682.269">accept you to pass me the number. Pass me something, I'll deal with it. (Laughing) So</span> <span data-start="682.269" data-end="688.49">it doesn't\hlike a string. Is it like flawed number, is it array? Is it true? I will do</span> <span data-start="688.49" data-end="702.199">it. Pass me nothing, I assume it's zero. Pass me NaN, I assume it's zero. Important. It's</span> <span data-start="702.199" data-end="709.709">so cool. Minus two, I will give you character minus two, no exceptions, no null rejoin.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="709.709" data-end="717.589">I will join you the empty character; what did you expect? (Laughing) It's the perfect</span> <span data-start="717.589" data-end="723.209">answer to what is the character? This character. Not like no character; what are you talking</span> <span data-start="723.209" data-end="727.569">about? There is no character. What are you doing? This is a character, empty character.</span> <span data-start="727.569" data-end="735.379">This is so awesome. I mean, seriously, this is the poetry of the language. This is the</span> <span data-start="735.379" data-end="743.41">JavaScript at its best. That's not the finish of the jar add. It's not only acceptable to</span> <span data-start="743.41" data-end="749.069">the argument you're passing in, it's also acceptable to the “this”, to the context</span> <span data-start="749.069" data-end="757.249">of it. We change the ‑‑ put it on the number prototype. And you say NaN jar add</span> <span data-start="757.249" data-end="772.059">and give you “N”, boom. Boolean? Yep. How awesome was it with that, seriously? (Laughing)</span> <span data-start="772.059" data-end="782.18">Guys, this is a JavaScript. Please, welcome. And, when you write your code in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="782.18" data-end="786.93">it should look just like that. It should be just like that. Your functions should be just</span> <span data-start="786.93" data-end="793.62">like that. Like in grab your function, use it the way I want, like this, like that, whatever</span> <span data-start="793.62" data-end="801.139">and it should work. And it shouldn't really care. Because JavaScript is a careless language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="801.139" data-end="811.189">You should care less. Users of your API should care less. You know, it's like a software</span> <span data-start="811.189" data-end="820.24">kind of language. It doesn't really care. It just does it business. Now I start talking</span> <span data-start="820.24" data-end="828.55">about emptiness in the beginning. The JavaScript is seriously about emptiness. It has many</span> <span data-start="828.55" data-end="835.129">ways to express emptiness. How many other languages could give you so many ways to say</span> <span data-start="835.129" data-end="842.389">this is empty? There is nothing there. It's — nothing exists. Well, the three obvious</span> <span data-start="842.389" data-end="849.449">candidates is NaN, null and . So NaN is kind of empty number, not zero, empty</span> <span data-start="849.449" data-end="856.699">number. Not a number. The concept of NaN is kind of funny in itself, like, number which</span> <span data-start="856.699" data-end="861.43">is not a number but still number. It’s like, this is so philosophical, you should sit and</span> <span data-start="861.43" data-end="869.8">meditate on it like in a Lotus pose for a while. What is null? It's like, not object,</span> <span data-start="869.8" data-end="874.769">it's empty but it’s not really empty because it's null. The  is the next level</span> <span data-start="874.769" data-end="896.329">of null. It's like it's not even null. (Laughing) It's not defined, but it is\h‑‑ it has</span> <span data-start="896.329" data-end="899.04">a value. (Whispers) Holy shit. (Applause) This is so awesome just stop, stop rushing</span> <span data-start="899.04" data-end="906.35">writing your code and working with Shadow DOM, just stop. Look at the beauty in your</span> <span data-start="906.35" data-end="913.899">hands. Look at this like, oh my God, this is so cool. You think this is all about emptiness?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="913.899" data-end="924.8">JavaScript has more to tell you about emptiness. Let's say we have two arrays. One we create</span> <span data-start="924.8" data-end="932.959">like array of two and another we create like, well, using the brackets and , undefined.</span> <span data-start="932.959" data-end="940.149">And these arrays are equal, not equal like this, but let's say equal like that. Okay.</span> <span data-start="940.149" data-end="948.199">So they are the same. Okay. So if we say, we create variable ‘a’ equals to array,</span> <span data-start="948.199" data-end="953.36">created like array of two, variable two equals array of ; a of zero equals to b</span> <span data-start="953.36" data-end="960.629">of zero, yes; a of one equals b of one, yes; a length equals b length, yes. So they are</span> <span data-start="960.629" data-end="972.55">the same, right? Of course not (Laughs). Of course not. We call b.map allot, we have two</span> <span data-start="972.55" data-end="983.23">alerts . We have a.map alert and there no alerts, nothing happens. What, what</span> <span data-start="983.23" data-end="999.98">one in a false, one in b true. So, array b has two values which are equal to .</span> <span data-start="999.98" data-end="1012.72">Undefined is a value. And array a has two slots for values. And they are empty. (Laughter)</span> <span data-start="1012.72" data-end="1019.749">Yeah…getting there? This is a true emptiness. They're not even there. When you're asking</span> <span data-start="1019.749" data-end="1029.449">for it, ask for a value, , but this value is not in the array. Baaaaahhhh…the</span> <span data-start="1029.449" data-end="1051.68">emptiness. How then and philosophical is this, damn it?! This is, I just showed you, emptiness,</span> <span data-start="1051.68" data-end="1059.52">saying nothing. And as always there is nothing new, and obviously, I want to say a bit about</span> <span data-start="1059.52" data-end="1066.61">the new operator. I personally always feel that the new operator is sort of added there</span> <span data-start="1066.61" data-end="1075.91">as a way to please Java developers so they feel, oh, this is just like Java.. (Whispers)</span> <span data-start="1075.91" data-end="1085.36">… nothing like Java. And to confuse the shit out of everybody. I personally like,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1085.36" data-end="1090.94">I use new operator when I need to create some prototype of thing and want to create some</span> <span data-start="1090.94" data-end="1098.67">internal, I don't like to call them classes, but apparently they are. And, but, I hate</span> <span data-start="1098.67" data-end="1107.07">the APIs which tell you, you have to use "new" something like what was this? My favorite</span> <span data-start="1107.07" data-end="1116">one was … damn, I forgot the name. You know, when the physics imitator, and you have to</span> <span data-start="1116" data-end="1124.8">create new rectangle where you pass new point X Y comma new point X Y, like what the hell</span> <span data-start="1124.8" data-end="1130.87">is that? Why you create objects for everything? With “new” it's like, it's a Java, it</span> <span data-start="1130.87" data-end="1138.52">smells like Java, and I don't like the smell. I think the new\h‑‑ like your API shouldn't</span> <span data-start="1138.52" data-end="1143.8">tell people to use "new". I created the Raphael, and I had the mistake to call it from the</span> <span data-start="1143.8" data-end="1153">capital letter because it's old library, and I saw some people write new Raphael instead</span> <span data-start="1153" data-end="1159.01">of Raphael. The thing is nothing happens. And I just tired of correcting them, like,</span> <span data-start="1159.01" data-end="1163.23">okay, if you feel like this makes you feel more safe to write "new" in front of, write</span> <span data-start="1163.23" data-end="1170.78">it, but you don't have to. In fact, many places in JavaScript you don't have to. Who remember</span> <span data-start="1170.78" data-end="1179.9">seeing code like this? Who is old enough? (Laughs) It was like the trade mark of a loser</span> <span data-start="1179.9" data-end="1188">(clicks tounge). You write new object already, and everybody is like, oh, look at this, so</span> <span data-start="1188" data-end="1193.51">lame. And then people like, yeah, this is the cool way. This is like, it was like a</span> <span data-start="1193.51" data-end="1199.77">club people who write like this and people who write like that. Nowadays nobody writes</span> <span data-start="1199.77" data-end="1209.23">the first way. Is anybody\h‑‑ nobody will accept any way. If you're a Java developer,</span> <span data-start="1209.23" data-end="1213.32">maybe writing the object is more convenient for you and more easy to grasp, but, actually,</span> <span data-start="1213.32" data-end="1218.73">there's a better way. And it's almost true for everything. It's a very common concept,</span> <span data-start="1218.73" data-end="1225.3">very common pattern in JavaScript itself having SomeConstructor, calling as a function is</span> <span data-start="1225.3" data-end="1232.27">absolutely equal calling new Someconstructor. It's true for object, it's true for array,</span> <span data-start="1232.27" data-end="1239.15">it's true for RegEx, it's true for Function. JavaScript kind of giving you a hint, like,</span> <span data-start="1239.15" data-end="1249.13">you know, maybe, eh, maybe you shouldn't do .. whatever. There are exceptions. The date</span> <span data-start="1249.13" data-end="1254.65">object. The date object always looks like an alien inside the JavaScript because it's</span> <span data-start="1254.65" data-end="1262.29">copied from the Java as much as it possibly can. That's why it's so ugly, but it's very</span> <span data-start="1262.29" data-end="1271.73">useful, so we have to use it. But it's so ugly, oh, my God. The some constructor, number,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1271.73" data-end="1278.15">Boolean and string, because they're wrappers for native primitive types. They behave differently</span> <span data-start="1278.15" data-end="1284.21">when you code then without new; they just convert something to the primitive. The new</span> <span data-start="1284.21" data-end="1292.26">ES6 have constructors like set, map and weak map. I don't know who wrote this rule inside</span> <span data-start="1292.26" data-end="1300.07">them, but he's definitely not a JavaScript Jedi, because if you call Set without new,</span> <span data-start="1300.07" data-end="1307.99">it's not just behave differently it throw you bloody exception in your face. What the</span> <span data-start="1307.99" data-end="1312.66">hell?! JavaScript doesn't throw exceptions unless there is a very serious reason for</span> <span data-start="1312.66" data-end="1325.07">that. I don't see serious reason for calling Set without new. Amateurs. Of course they</span> <span data-start="1325.07" data-end="1331.44">are like functions, and functions are a big deal. And I wanted to tell if you wanted to</span> <span data-start="1331.44" data-end="1335.68">know more about functions you could watch the talk, about functional programming, but</span> <span data-start="1335.68" data-end="1340.67">unfortunately it happens right now. So if you want the learn more about functions, you</span> <span data-start="1340.67" data-end="1350.89">chose the wrong talk, congratulations. There are five faces of the function. And this is</span> <span data-start="1350.89" data-end="1356.53">sort of also very JavaScript way that the functions, anything could be anything, anything</span> <span data-start="1356.53" data-end="1361.46">could be used in the many different ways. You could wrap it in different positions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1361.46" data-end="1366.99">Functions has different positions too. So, if you create a function, which reference</span> <span data-start="1366.99" data-end="1371.55">some variables outside the function, you create the closure, and you all know this, and it's</span> <span data-start="1371.55" data-end="1378.51">boring, I know, but I have to tell it, maybe somebody doesn't. It's writing code like this</span> <span data-start="1378.51" data-end="1384.65">to make it more obvious. You're already seeing like already three phases of functions right</span> <span data-start="1384.65" data-end="1395.19">here. So function. Create a scope. Functions create the closure. And you can rejoin functions,</span> <span data-start="1395.19" data-end="1400.59">because function is also an object. I know I have a thing like Captain Obvious right</span> <span data-start="1400.59" data-end="1407.24">now, but bear with me. You can\halso use functions as a constructor to create new objects, and</span> <span data-start="1407.24" data-end="1413.97">you can use the function as a, basically, just subroutine, which you can call with arguments</span> <span data-start="1413.97" data-end="1419.09">and return or something. This is, these are obvious things, what I'm trying to point is</span> <span data-start="1419.09" data-end="1426.24">that it's the function itself is having so many roles, and you can use it in so many</span> <span data-start="1426.24" data-end="1432.63">ways. This is truly a JavaScript way of doing things. And it's not just the only way of</span> <span data-start="1432.63" data-end="1437.85">doing things. There are other languages that do the same thing like Lisp or Luna, like,</span> <span data-start="1437.85" data-end="1442.71">whatever. It’s important to embrace it and not trying to avoid it and trying to say,</span> <span data-start="1442.71" data-end="1449.69">okay, I will write a different way. I will just use this two bedroom instead of one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1449.69" data-end="1456.72">And there is a JavaScript paradox function constructor is a function and function constructor</span> <span data-start="1456.72" data-end="1463.63">is a function, so it's like the movie Inception where they go up the stairs and coming back</span> <span data-start="1463.63" data-end="1472">to wherever they started going. So, what I'm trying to say apart from show that I read</span> <span data-start="1472" data-end="1478.12">the spec and found some interesting parts of JavaScript. What I'm trying to say is that</span> <span data-start="1478.12" data-end="1486.03">JavaScript has it's own way, and instead of trying to do it in this or that way, how about</span> <span data-start="1486.03" data-end="1492.47">you step back, look, and I just scratch the surface here. It's a very short talk. You</span> <span data-start="1492.47" data-end="1496.6">could find more interesting features of JavaScript, which you probably haven't seen before, and</span> <span data-start="1496.6" data-end="1502.6">try to think, what would JavaScript do? You know, when I was a kid and I have coming to</span> <span data-start="1502.6" data-end="1509.7">a hard situation, I would think, what Bruce Lee would do, and then act like Bruce Lee.</span> <span data-start="1509.7" data-end="1518.54">Sometimes it helped, sometimes not (Laughing), but .. what will JavaScript do? When you</span> <span data-start="1518.54" data-end="1523.99">write your code, don't think, oh, what I want. What is the JavaScript way to do this thing?</span> <span data-start="1523.99" data-end="1528.78">What would be the JavaScript\h‑‑ what if this will end up inside the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1528.78" data-end="1534.9">language just like functions like parse in or jar add or something like that joined.</span> <span data-start="1534.9" data-end="1541.52">What would\h‑‑ how would I write this function? Do it this way and be truly enlightened</span> <span data-start="1541.52" data-end="1557">JavaScript developer. And ..  don't just sit and think about it. Open console,
read it, dig inside it, become the wizard.</span> </p>
