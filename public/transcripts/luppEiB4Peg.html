<p><span data-start="55.719" data-end="59.969">So gender forms.</span> <span data-start="59.969" data-end="66.56">Whenever I'm signing up for a new app or service, and I come across those not so fun radio buttons</span> <span data-start="66.56" data-end="71.5">that only have male or female, I feel a lot of feelings.</span> <span data-start="71.5" data-end="74.369">Most of them are not good ones.</span> <span data-start="74.369" data-end="78.42">I have a lot of thoughts like: why?</span> <span data-start="78.42" data-end="83.07">Why are you asking me for this information?</span> <span data-start="83.07" data-end="87.369">There are a lot of reasons why genders get baked into product.</span> <span data-start="87.369" data-end="94.869">There are maybe medical reasons, there might be legal or compliance reasons, but mostly</span> <span data-start="94.869" data-end="100.45">it's demographics or marketing, like ad targeting.</span> <span data-start="100.45" data-end="107.499">I'm not saying these are good reasons, I'm just saying this is why it happened.</span> <span data-start="107.499" data-end="114.109">When I first signed up for Pinterest, way before I started working there, I noticed</span> <span data-start="114.109" data-end="121.83">those fun radio buttons that reinforced the gender binary and little did I know that I</span> <span data-start="121.83" data-end="127.549">would soon be in a position to change that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="127.549" data-end="129.759">But how did I get there?</span> <span data-start="129.759" data-end="133.15">Software engineering is not my first career.</span> <span data-start="133.15" data-end="140.2">I have a degree in gender studies and then I spent about five years working [sound problem]</span> <span data-start="140.2" data-end="148.549">.. but then I got tired of working emotional labour on behalf of a major corporation so</span> <span data-start="148.549" data-end="156.19">I quit my job, learned to code and got my very first engineer job at Pinterest.</span> <span data-start="156.19" data-end="158.89">I was shit terrified.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.89" data-end="166.53">I had no idea what I was doing and basically was convinced I would be fired at any moment.</span> <span data-start="166.53" data-end="171.93">Somehow I managed to work through all that pain, confusion, fear and terror, and learned</span> <span data-start="171.93" data-end="176.25">a bunch of stuff, and now it has been three years and I haven't been fired yet.</span> <span data-start="176.25" data-end="178.55">So yay!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="178.55" data-end="186.98">Anyway, after I first got hired about a year passed and then I started to feel more confident,</span> <span data-start="186.98" data-end="193.41">not just in my technical skills but in my inner personal understanding of politics that</span> <span data-start="193.41" data-end="198.79">were going on around and above me and how people actually worked together to build and</span> <span data-start="198.79" data-end="203.439">ship products.</span> <span data-start="203.439" data-end="208.94">Being the kind of stirring it up sort of person that I am, I started some conversations about</span> <span data-start="208.94" data-end="211.59">the gender thing.</span> <span data-start="211.59" data-end="217.56">I wouldn't say those conversations were great, but neither were they awful.</span> <span data-start="217.56" data-end="222.239">People were like: yeah, I mean this isn't going to move our core metrics, we should</span> <span data-start="222.239" data-end="224.98">just focus on things that are.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="224.98" data-end="229.83">Now, don't get me wrong, I was never under the impression that expanded gender options</span> <span data-start="229.83" data-end="231.67">are going to move core metrics.</span> <span data-start="231.67" data-end="233.489">That's not the point.</span> <span data-start="233.489" data-end="237.989">It's the kind of feature you build because it's the right thing to do if you want your</span> <span data-start="237.989" data-end="248">product to be inclusive of everybody, so .. [sound problem] .. if I wanted this feature to exist</span> <span data-start="248" data-end="253.939">I was going to have to make it happen, and I was pretty sure I can figure it out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.939" data-end="259.69">Also I realised that I could leverage lack of co-ownership which was actually a big problem</span> <span data-start="259.69" data-end="263.28">across the whole organisation — code ownership.</span> <span data-start="263.28" data-end="267.11">I didn't have to ask permission because no one owned that code.</span> <span data-start="267.11" data-end="269.35">I could just build it.</span> <span data-start="269.35" data-end="281.57">Here are back end changes I made so before I started work on it we had this enum that</span> <span data-start="281.57" data-end="284.75">represented gender.</span> <span data-start="284.75" data-end="289.81">Someone had run an AB experiment and discovered that if you don't force people to put in their</span> <span data-start="289.81" data-end="293.01">gender, you get more signups.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="293.01" data-end="296.14">Surprise, surprise.</span> <span data-start="296.14" data-end="302.08">So what I did, I added an optional string to the user struct to present a user's custom</span> <span data-start="302.08" data-end="303.08">gender value.</span> <span data-start="303.08" data-end="308.92">It is my firm belief that gender should be represented by a string, not a binary value,</span> <span data-start="308.92" data-end="314.71">so that way people could put in whatever they want, including an emoji.</span> <span data-start="314.71" data-end="319.02">What is the plural of emoji, is it emojis?</span> <span data-start="319.02" data-end="320.56">Emoji?</span> <span data-start="320.56" data-end="326.65">Anyway, emoji are getting more and more important because as technology becomes more ubiquitous,</span> <span data-start="326.65" data-end="334.35">so does text-based communication and emoji are a great way of adding subtext to text.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.35" data-end="339.69">Making emoji and hell all Unicode representative of the full spectrum of human diversity that</span> <span data-start="339.69" data-end="346.34">exists is a little outside of the scope of my talk today but I will say that the emoji</span> <span data-start="346.34" data-end="350.46">I am showing on screen don't officially exist yet.</span> <span data-start="350.46" data-end="354.55">Although I hope they do soon.</span> <span data-start="354.55" data-end="361.83">We are getting a non-binary emoji though in the 2017 spec which is pretty rad.</span> <span data-start="361.83" data-end="370.43">Anyway, let's talk about internationalisation and localisation and how they relate to gender.</span> <span data-start="370.43" data-end="376.41">People use these terms interchangeably but they are not exactly the same.</span> <span data-start="376.41" data-end="380.97">Localisation is a process of adapting your product, the text, the design, to work in</span> <span data-start="380.97" data-end="388.16">one specific market, so this picture here is from the movie Inside Out.</span> <span data-start="388.16" data-end="393.66">In it, the protagonist, Reilly, she is a little girl and she just hates broccoli, except for</span> <span data-start="393.66" data-end="399.8">in Japan where she hates green peppers, because green peppers are a vegetable that are more</span> <span data-start="399.8" data-end="403.37">hated by children in Japan than broccoli.</span> <span data-start="403.37" data-end="408.02">Since Inside Out is a movie about feelings and empathy it was important to get the little</span> <span data-start="408.02" data-end="414.37">details right so the movie would work cross-culturally.</span> <span data-start="414.37" data-end="421.27">So internationalisation is the more generally used case, like let's say you kept having</span> <span data-start="421.27" data-end="428.97">this vegetable problem and you decided to build like a vegetable injector and ship it</span> <span data-start="428.97" data-end="433.24">so that you could show users a different vegetable base somewhere in the world and that would</span> <span data-start="433.24" data-end="437.74">be an example of internationalisation, kind of the tools and framework that enable you</span> <span data-start="437.74" data-end="442.31">to localise in multiple languages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.31" data-end="448.83">A base use case for localisation, okay you have an English string and it represents some</span> <span data-start="448.83" data-end="451.08">user face in copy.</span> <span data-start="451.08" data-end="457.19">The string has a placeholder value in it that represents the user name.</span> <span data-start="457.19" data-end="462.33">At run time we look up the user's language setting and then replace the string with the</span> <span data-start="462.33" data-end="467.08">string in their language, and then also replace the placeholder value.</span> <span data-start="467.08" data-end="475.66">So if I'm a German user and my name is Tilde, hello user name becomes hello Tilde.</span> <span data-start="475.66" data-end="479.06">Why does this matter for expanded gender options?</span> <span data-start="479.06" data-end="487.09">Well, I'm not a linguist, so bear with me, but there's this concept of grammatical gender</span> <span data-start="487.09" data-end="491.55">that about a quarter of the world's languages have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="491.55" data-end="497.17">Grammatically gender languages have — the nouns have genders and you have to match the</span> <span data-start="497.17" data-end="504.56">other parts of speech in the sentence, like verbs and so forth, with the noun.</span> <span data-start="504.56" data-end="510.36">English is not grammatically gendered but it does still have gender baked into it in</span> <span data-start="510.36" data-end="518.18">all kinds of little places like third person pronouns and titles, so when I first decided</span> <span data-start="518.18" data-end="523.829">to build expanded gender options for Pinterest, I wanted to allow users to supply their preferred</span> <span data-start="523.829" data-end="526.75">pronoun too.</span> <span data-start="526.75" data-end="530.519">It's more inclusive to not only allow people to say what their gender is but to specify</span> <span data-start="530.519" data-end="533.49">how they would like to be referred to.</span> <span data-start="533.49" data-end="540">Unfortunately, that didn't really work out because the localisation provider that we</span> <span data-start="540" data-end="549.38">were using didn't handle gender in placeholder strings so we had to kind of work around that.</span> <span data-start="549.38" data-end="555.18">On the plus side, the translation provider not using gender and placeholder strings meant</span> <span data-start="555.18" data-end="561.24">that all of our user interface and copy was already gender neutral as it refers to users.</span> <span data-start="561.24" data-end="566.9">The writing team hates it because you end up with awkwardly worded sentences where you</span> <span data-start="566.9" data-end="582.63">are avoiding pronouns but at the same time I did not have to do any extra work.</span> <span data-start="582.63" data-end="592.779">Oh.</span> <span data-start="592.779" data-end="596.92">This is awkward.</span> <span data-start="596.92" data-end="601.36">[Laughter] Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="601.36" data-end="606.639">I didn't have to do any extra work to make our text work for users who don't identify</span> <span data-start="606.639" data-end="608.42">as male or female.</span> <span data-start="608.42" data-end="611.089">Who cares what the writing team thinks?</span> <span data-start="611.089" data-end="613.589">That's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="613.589" data-end="618.769">So if you are not like Pinterest and you are not like locked into a contract with a certain</span> <span data-start="618.769" data-end="621.819">localisation provider you have options.</span> <span data-start="621.819" data-end="627.73">I found a bunch of software packages that support localisation of gender and placeholder</span> <span data-start="627.73" data-end="630.01">strings out of the box.</span> <span data-start="630.01" data-end="631.6">Caveat.</span> <span data-start="631.6" data-end="635.872">I have not used any of these personally, so if you have I would love to know what your</span> <span data-start="635.872" data-end="637.25">experience is like.</span> <span data-start="637.25" data-end="640.38">Come find me after the talk or tweet at me or something.</span> <span data-start="640.38" data-end="645.709">But man, can we talk about pronouns for a second?</span> <span data-start="645.709" data-end="648.16">Pronouns are complicated.</span> <span data-start="648.16" data-end="655.18">I wanted to shout out for having the preferred gender pronoun buttons, that makes my heart</span> <span data-start="655.18" data-end="661.579">warm, I hope every conference is doing that, but anyway a lot of people who don't identify</span> <span data-start="661.579" data-end="668.69">as male or female use "they" as their preference but there are so many pronouns out there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="668.69" data-end="682.379">A website is trying to list all the different pronouns but how do</span> <span data-start="682.379" data-end="688.16">these concepts translate cross-culturally and cross languages?</span> <span data-start="688.16" data-end="692.86">Some languages don't have gender pronouns at all.</span> <span data-start="692.86" data-end="700.48">Some languages like Farsi have pronouns for if an object is animate versus inanimate,</span> <span data-start="700.48" data-end="702.319">for example.</span> <span data-start="702.319" data-end="710.55">So make sure your copy writers and translators are working with linguists who end the best</span> <span data-start="710.55" data-end="714.329">gender preferences in that language.</span> <span data-start="714.329" data-end="721.73">So talked about the back end, talked about localisation stuff, then I did the front end</span> <span data-start="721.73" data-end="728.07">or the middleware and API changes, blah blah blah, and then I made the front end changes.</span> <span data-start="728.07" data-end="733.25">The first thing I did was put user gender on the settings page.</span> <span data-start="733.25" data-end="737.2">Politically speaking, it's pretty easy to put user gender on the settings page.</span> <span data-start="737.2" data-end="742.899">It's like the junk draw of any application and no one gives a shit.</span> <span data-start="742.899" data-end="747.45">A funny thing happened after I did this though.</span> <span data-start="747.45" data-end="752.85">People, even though the conversation I had started earlier had been a little lukewarm,</span> <span data-start="752.85" data-end="757.72">people came out of the woodwork to support me and they were like: oh, this is so cool,</span> <span data-start="757.72" data-end="760.629">what can I do to help?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="760.629" data-end="770.629">I was like: well, it sure would be great if we supported this feature on iOS and Android</span> <span data-start="770.629" data-end="777.04">as well so I was able to help people make that happen.</span> <span data-start="777.04" data-end="780.399">It didn't solve the original problem though.</span> <span data-start="780.399" data-end="785.66">Users still had to put in their gender when they signed up for Pinterest and I wanted</span> <span data-start="785.66" data-end="787.54">to fix that.</span> <span data-start="787.54" data-end="802.98">Unlike the — oh no — unlike the settings page the sign-up form is very political and people</span> <span data-start="802.98" data-end="807.959">really care about every pixel on that page, and it impacts top line metrics, so I knew</span> <span data-start="807.959" data-end="813.18">that we would need to take a more data-driven approach.</span> <span data-start="813.18" data-end="818.61">Here are a few design iterations we went through on the way to shipping expanded gender options</span> <span data-start="818.61" data-end="821.819">on sign-up.</span> <span data-start="821.819" data-end="825.209">The first thing I tried was putting a simple radio button in.</span> <span data-start="825.209" data-end="832.74">When a user checks the radio button, another text box pops up where they can put in their</span> <span data-start="832.74" data-end="835.939">gender value.</span> <span data-start="835.939" data-end="845.29">The problem with this is the sign-up code is used in many places, which is a good thing,</span> <span data-start="845.29" data-end="846.29">right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="846.29" data-end="847.29">Don't repeat yourself.</span> <span data-start="847.29" data-end="854.3">But one of those places was this narrow little skinny little model, and when you internationalise</span> <span data-start="854.3" data-end="859.019">text or when text is localised into longer languages such as French or German, you need</span> <span data-start="859.019" data-end="865.04">to account for about 30% more room for that text.</span> <span data-start="865.04" data-end="869.08">So the text didn't fit in French and German in the skinny model.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1020.569" data-end="1027.7">It's a little bit of a tricky design problem, right, like how do you make a feature visible</span> <span data-start="1027.7" data-end="1032.76">for the small minority of users who really care about it but not so visible that the</span> <span data-start="1032.76" data-end="1040.44">majority who might not understand or be upset won't notice it and get pissed off?</span> <span data-start="1040.44" data-end="1042.33">This is what we came up with.</span> <span data-start="1042.33" data-end="1046.08">There's a little info icon.</span> <span data-start="1046.08" data-end="1049.15">When you hover over it we show a tool tip.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1049.15" data-end="1055.5">On the tool tip we explain why we want this information, which is kind of important, and</span> <span data-start="1055.5" data-end="1060.21">then allow you to put in your custom gender string.</span> <span data-start="1060.21" data-end="1066.75">After a user clicks save, we replace male or female with the text that they typed in.</span> <span data-start="1066.75" data-end="1071.41">So we rolled this out as an AB experiment.</span> <span data-start="1071.41" data-end="1076.19">Unfortunately, signups were down about 1%.</span> <span data-start="1076.19" data-end="1082.68">Wamp-wamp, back to the drawing board.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1082.68" data-end="1088.62">I hypothesised that maybe users were unintentionally triggering the hover interaction, getting</span> <span data-start="1088.62" data-end="1094.52">confused, so I said: let's make this a click interaction.</span> <span data-start="1094.52" data-end="1101.16">When we tried it with a click interaction, signups were flat, so we shipped it.</span> <span data-start="1101.16" data-end="1102.99">Yay!</span> <span data-start="1102.99" data-end="1110.29">[Applause] Thank you, finally.</span> <span data-start="1110.29" data-end="1116.53">We also — I measured that people were actually using the custom gender part because, if signups</span> <span data-start="1116.53" data-end="1121.76">were flat but if no one is actually using it, then what's the point, right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1121.76" data-end="1125.42">But then we took things even a step further.</span> <span data-start="1125.42" data-end="1130.9">I was approached by a designer on the mobile team and she was like: hey, I'm re-doing the</span> <span data-start="1130.9" data-end="1135.99">whole mobile sign-up flow and why is custom gender on web so hidden?</span> <span data-start="1135.99" data-end="1139.17">Can't we just put it in there with the other options?</span> <span data-start="1139.17" data-end="1145.9">And I was like: you are not going to get any argument from me about that.</span> <span data-start="1145.9" data-end="1149.89">This was wrapped in an AB experiment too, of course.</span> <span data-start="1149.89" data-end="1154.88">It's not exactly an apples to apples comparison because the new sign-up flow is visually very</span> <span data-start="1154.88" data-end="1161.76">different but the metrics are better for it so that's what we went with.</span> <span data-start="1161.76" data-end="1167.01">Of course, quantitative metrics never tell the whole story so we did qualitative user</span> <span data-start="1167.01" data-end="1169.84">research as well.</span> <span data-start="1169.84" data-end="1174.59">Sentiment towards custom gender options in this research was positive.</span> <span data-start="1174.59" data-end="1179.53">People said things like: custom gender is an awesome idea for our progressive social</span> <span data-start="1179.53" data-end="1180.69">climate.</span> <span data-start="1180.69" data-end="1185.63">We got some love on social media as well.</span> <span data-start="1185.63" data-end="1189.75">But the whole process got me thinking, like why?</span> <span data-start="1189.75" data-end="1193.35">Why is this feature so important to me?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1193.35" data-end="1196.92">Why do I care so much?</span> <span data-start="1196.92" data-end="1204.33">Yes, so on this slide there's a movie which some of you have clearly seen called But I'm</span> <span data-start="1204.33" data-end="1212.26">a Cheerleader and in this movie Megan, the main character, has a realisation that not</span> <span data-start="1212.26" data-end="1216.16">everybody struggles with same sex attraction.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1216.16" data-end="1220">She is different, she is a lesbian.</span> <span data-start="1220" data-end="1226.32">Building this feature, I realised not everybody has — feels about it, having to put gender</span> <span data-start="1226.32" data-end="1228.23">into their box.</span> <span data-start="1228.23" data-end="1232.95">But I do, I'm different, I am non-binary.</span> <span data-start="1232.95" data-end="1235.36">What does this mean for me?</span> <span data-start="1235.36" data-end="1238.65">Still figuring that out, TBH.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1238.65" data-end="1246.86">So just to recap, building this feature taught me that you can leverage the chaos that will</span> <span data-start="1246.86" data-end="1257.09">inevitably be present in your organisation to advance your social justice warrior agenda.</span> <span data-start="1257.09" data-end="1270.09">[Laughter] [Applause] After I got the ball rolling, people came</span> <span data-start="1270.09" data-end="1272.63">out of the woodwork to help me.</span> <span data-start="1272.63" data-end="1279.51">Finally, the process of writing software, building stuff, getting it right, getting</span> <span data-start="1279.51" data-end="1283.54">it wrong, can teach you about yourself in ways that you might not expect.</span> <span data-start="1283.54" data-end="1284.54">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="1284.54" data-end="1285.54">[Applause] >> Wasn't that absolutely fantastic?</span> <span data-start="1285.54" data-end="1286.54">That one gave me so many feels right here in my heart organ.</span> </p>
