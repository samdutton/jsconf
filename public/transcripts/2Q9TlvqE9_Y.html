<p><span data-start="905.329" data-end="921.79">I am going to do that using Beaker's datarchive constructor which basically gives you</span> <span data-start="921.79" data-end="928.74">access to the functions that help you connect to the peer-to-peer network.</span> <span data-start="928.74" data-end="932.97">We have a variable that we will be able to work with here.</span> <span data-start="932.97" data-end="936.88">Let's start off with just listing all the files in this website.</span> <span data-start="936.88" data-end="942.87">You might notice this looks a lot like the Node files API and that was on purpose.</span> <span data-start="942.87" data-end="947.47">Let's do files.readdir and we will read the top level directory.</span> <span data-start="947.47" data-end="953.23">Then we will console.log the output.</span> <span data-start="953.23" data-end="962.97">We are seeing a listing of all files that compose this website.</span> <span data-start="962.97" data-end="965.92">There is only 65 of them right now.</span> <span data-start="965.92" data-end="969.67">Let's see if we can read an individual file, the content file.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="969.67" data-end="976.209">So files.readFile and let's do index.html file.</span> <span data-start="976.209" data-end="983.73">We are looking at the actual content of this page now.</span> <span data-start="983.73" data-end="990.04">We can do all sorts of things like readfiles, readfile listing, and we can write two files</span> <span data-start="990.04" data-end="991.04">also.</span> <span data-start="991.04" data-end="998.69">This gets interesting when you think about storing data in websites.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1054.059" data-end="1055.34">I like a lot of things about Twitter.</span> <span data-start="1055.34" data-end="1061.79">I dislike some things about Twitter but I like that it gives me a nice feed, I can follow</span> <span data-start="1061.79" data-end="1067.29">my friends on, and I like that the content is short, sweet, and enjoyable most of the</span> <span data-start="1067.29" data-end="1068.29">time.</span> <span data-start="1068.29" data-end="1073.64">So, we said how far can we get with building something like Twitter using peer-to-peer</span> <span data-start="1073.64" data-end="1075.4">protocols and we got pretty far actually.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1075.4" data-end="1077.86">It is pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="1077.86" data-end="1083.38">This doesn't look like much but I will break down the architecture.</span> <span data-start="1083.38" data-end="1085.48">Fritter works in two pieces.</span> <span data-start="1085.48" data-end="1088.9">There is the application itself which is what we are looking at.</span> <span data-start="1088.9" data-end="1097">It is a JavaScript application that uses Beaker's APIs to consume a profile and fetch data from</span> <span data-start="1097" data-end="1100.87">the peer-to-peer network and render it into a nice feed.</span> <span data-start="1100.87" data-end="1110.8">When I write a post, Beaker uses the writefile API to write a post to my profile.</span> <span data-start="1110.8" data-end="1112.71">Works like you would expect.</span> <span data-start="1112.71" data-end="1116.54">But what does a profile actually look like?</span> <span data-start="1116.54" data-end="1117.54">What is a profile?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1117.54" data-end="1121.29">Well, it is not a row and database that lives up in a server somewhere.</span> <span data-start="1121.29" data-end="1124.39">It is just a website.</span> <span data-start="1124.39" data-end="1126.39">This is it.</span> <span data-start="1126.39" data-end="1128.3">It has some metadata.</span> <span data-start="1128.3" data-end="1137.85">My name, my bio, well this is a fake profile, it has information about the people I follow,</span> <span data-start="1137.85" data-end="1142.69">and it contains my posts in JSON.</span> <span data-start="1142.69" data-end="1148.34">This is interesting because we separated the data from the application which is not news.</span> <span data-start="1148.34" data-end="1153.71">We are used to doing that as developers but what is different is your profile on Fritter</span> <span data-start="1153.71" data-end="1155.28">is just a website.</span> <span data-start="1155.28" data-end="1157.799">It is not tied to Fritter.</span> <span data-start="1157.799" data-end="1166.59">If you wanted to customize your own version of Fritter you could do that and you wouldn't</span> <span data-start="1166.59" data-end="1169.67">need to give up your circle of friends or content.</span> <span data-start="1169.67" data-end="1174.14">You could carry on like normal.</span> <span data-start="1174.14" data-end="1178.35">I think this demonstrates a lot of potential for building meaningful applications with</span> <span data-start="1178.35" data-end="1181.77">peer-to-peer protocols.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1181.77" data-end="1185.15">This is my demo profile.</span> <span data-start="1185.15" data-end="1188.11">There are posts from my friends, like two friends.</span> <span data-start="1188.11" data-end="1190.09">And people talk to each other.</span> <span data-start="1190.09" data-end="1194.64">I am not going to say this is the ideal architecture for moving forward on the peer-to-peer web</span> <span data-start="1194.64" data-end="1199.08">or it won't have its own kind of problems.</span> <span data-start="1199.08" data-end="1205.89">But it is a kind of community controlled social media and that's really, really exciting to</span> <span data-start="1205.89" data-end="1211.63">me because if there is anything I have learned about being a woman online in the last year</span> <span data-start="1211.63" data-end="1217.25">and a half is that sometimes you really do want to take control over who you do and don't</span> <span data-start="1217.25" data-end="1223.14">talk to because otherwise it gets a little bit noisy.</span> <span data-start="1223.14" data-end="1225.9">So that is a quick and dirty tour of Beaker.</span> <span data-start="1225.9" data-end="1227.85">We are experimenting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1227.85" data-end="1233.49">We are doing a lot of things that are strange and most certainly don't adhere to what is</span> <span data-start="1233.49" data-end="1240.79">standard but we think it is worthwhile to be a little messy and see what happens.</span> <span data-start="1240.79" data-end="1250.1">We don't have the kind of reputation like Apple or Mozilla or Google does to influence</span> <span data-start="1250.1" data-end="1251.1">standards bodies.</span> <span data-start="1251.1" data-end="1255.549">We are just random people who had an idea and we built it.</span> <span data-start="1255.549" data-end="1258.08">We hope you will find it interesting.</span> <span data-start="1258.08" data-end="1262.23">If you want to try out Beaker and see what other people have built I recommend checking</span> <span data-start="1262.23" data-end="1263.24">out my website.</span> <span data-start="1263.24" data-end="1266.65">I have the P2P subdomain on my website.</span> <span data-start="1266.65" data-end="1275.65">I have a huge selection of apps, games, and other things people have built on the peer-to-peer</span> <span data-start="1275.65" data-end="1277.77">web.</span> <span data-start="1277.77" data-end="1283.66">Thank you for coming to learn about Beaker and the peer-to-peer web.</span> <span data-start="1283.66" data-end="1290.22">Come talk to me later and you can check out the slides on my website.</span> <span data-start="1290.22" data-end="1291.22">Thank you so much.</span> </p>
