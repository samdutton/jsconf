<p><span data-start="33.86" data-end="36.84">I can show you something, right?</span> <span data-start="36.84" data-end="43.46">The agenda that I want to go over today is basically first I want a little itty-bitty</span> <span data-start="43.46" data-end="49.82">intro to give you information and ECMAScript and Ecma in general.</span> <span data-start="49.82" data-end="55.71">Went we that you can about the minor features, the major features, and then a teeny tiny</span> <span data-start="55.71" data-end="57.04">out show.</span> <span data-start="57.04" data-end="62.4">Just clarifying that we are going to focus on the features with a little bit of information</span> <span data-start="62.4" data-end="65.3">on back and front.</span> <span data-start="65.3" data-end="67.57">Who is this person running on the stage?</span> <span data-start="67.57" data-end="69.8">And immediately yelling at you?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="69.8" data-end="71.47">My name is Tara Manicsic.</span> <span data-start="71.47" data-end="80.78">I'm a developer advocate at this great company called Progress Google Developer Expert, and</span> <span data-start="80.78" data-end="89.28">the mother of this awkward ball of fluff, Toshi, but as of five months ago, I'm also</span> <span data-start="89.28" data-end="94.6">the mother of this adorable chunk of flesh, Niko.</span> <span data-start="94.6" data-end="100.49">I did poorly Photoshop my baby on to me for a picture!</span> <span data-start="100.49" data-end="108.98">But, thank you!</span> <span data-start="108.98" data-end="115.37">Do not worry worry, this isn't a photo shop talk.</span> <span data-start="115.37" data-end="117.43">Those thighs aren't Photoshopped!</span> <span data-start="117.43" data-end="122.27">I want to do a little bit of an intro about Ecma and ECMAScript.</span> <span data-start="122.27" data-end="129.479">So, like any good super hero, I feel that ECMAScript has an origin story.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.479" data-end="134.78">It starts out with Ecma International which is actually, I learned doing this, I never</span> <span data-start="134.78" data-end="136.38">cared what Ecma stood for.</span> <span data-start="136.38" data-end="138.1">I probably should have.</span> <span data-start="138.1" data-end="139.91">I wanted to look into it now.</span> <span data-start="139.91" data-end="145.87">Some of you may know it is "European Computer Manufacturers' Association".</span> <span data-start="145.87" data-end="148.98">I'm very glad that we shortened it!</span> <span data-start="148.98" data-end="154.08">This started in 1960 because they saw how much we were using computers, and it needed</span> <span data-start="154.08" data-end="156.48">to be standardised.</span> <span data-start="156.48" data-end="164.4">From then, we knew we needed a standardisation for JavaScript, and that's where ECMAScript</span> <span data-start="164.4" data-end="165.55">came into play.</span> <span data-start="165.55" data-end="172.05">Sun, which is nor Oracle, had the rights to Java.</span> <span data-start="172.05" data-end="174.87">Have you heard of Java?</span> <span data-start="174.87" data-end="177.209">No!</span> <span data-start="177.209" data-end="183.88">That's the only association you will see between Java and JavaScript through Oracle.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.88" data-end="190.209">Since that was taken, they went with the corresponding standard host, Ecma, and made ECMAScript.</span> <span data-start="190.209" data-end="192.63">So now you know.</span> <span data-start="192.63" data-end="200.2">So, like, again, any super hero stories, we also have these pitfalls and weaknesses that</span> <span data-start="200.2" data-end="203.5">"build character", right?</span> <span data-start="203.5" data-end="208.58">For ECMAScript that was ES4 abandoned.</span> <span data-start="208.58" data-end="214.98">This was the version 4 of ECMAScript that there were so many political differences in</span> <span data-start="214.98" data-end="217.379">the group that they just abandoned it.</span> <span data-start="217.379" data-end="222.709">They couldn't release it or get past their differences, unfortunately.</span> <span data-start="222.709" data-end="225.98">Another one is what I like to call ES6 years.</span> <span data-start="225.98" data-end="228.11">Yes, it's a pun.</span> <span data-start="228.11" data-end="236.069">It took nearly six years for them to release from ES5.</span> <span data-start="236.069" data-end="241.83">To 2009 in December to found 15 in June is how long it took because it was so bloated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="241.83" data-end="247.5">There were so many things they were excited to release to JavaScript standard that it</span> <span data-start="247.5" data-end="249.599">took quite a long time.</span> <span data-start="249.599" data-end="255.96">But, again, like the super hero arch, from those arches, we get great things.</span> <span data-start="255.96" data-end="262.65">For instance, TC39, which is the technical committee, really started to try harder to</span> <span data-start="262.65" data-end="271.789">work together and reform and do a lot of work to make smaller packages come out after ES6</span> <span data-start="271.789" data-end="275.979">was so big, they decided let's do something more manageable, like developers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="275.979" data-end="279.43">We break everything into smaller pieces, so it's more manageable.</span> <span data-start="279.43" data-end="283.879">That's what they did with these new after ES6, all the releases after that were much</span> <span data-start="283.879" data-end="286.229">more manageable.</span> <span data-start="286.229" data-end="289.069">So, just a quick recap.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.069" data-end="291.71">I want to say what the proposal process is.</span> <span data-start="291.71" data-end="298.08">We're talking about our stage 4 proposals, and these, I always think I know what these</span> <span data-start="298.08" data-end="303.719">mean, and then I'm dumbfounded when I remember the actual process of what these proposals</span> <span data-start="303.719" data-end="309.729">are, because they're stage 0 which is the strawman, free form bringing in the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="309.729" data-end="314.74">Stage 1, because, you know, you have to start at one because we are programmers, or start</span> <span data-start="314.74" data-end="316.319">at zero, sorry.</span> <span data-start="316.319" data-end="320.97">And then stage one is the proposal where you have the champion of that proposal come in</span> <span data-start="320.97" data-end="322.849">and advocate for this idea.</span> <span data-start="322.849" data-end="325.039">They bring in APIs.</span> <span data-start="325.039" data-end="332.389">They talk about APIs, semantics and algorithms, and then version two, it's a version of what</span> <span data-start="332.389" data-end="334.279">will be in the specification.</span> <span data-start="334.279" data-end="339.139">If it makes it to stage 2, you have a good likelihood that it's going to make it all</span> <span data-start="339.139" data-end="340.229">the way through.</span> <span data-start="340.229" data-end="345.259">But, yet, there are still two more stages.</span> <span data-start="345.259" data-end="349.49">Stage 3 is it's mostly finished, this is the candidate.</span> <span data-start="349.49" data-end="352.38">And it's mostly finished but needs feedback.</span> <span data-start="352.38" data-end="354.11">And this is the one that is funny to me.</span> <span data-start="354.11" data-end="360.74">Stage 4, which we will be talking about, is finished, and I have quotations around that,</span> <span data-start="360.74" data-end="368.319">because, at this part, it's ready to be included in the standard, but they need to get test</span> <span data-start="368.319" data-end="370.74">262 acceptance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.74" data-end="377.419">They have to do a two-spec compliant shipping, that implementations need to pass the test,</span> <span data-start="377.419" data-end="382.389">significant practical experience with implementation needs done, and the ECMAScript text editor</span> <span data-start="382.389" data-end="384.5">must sign up on the spec edit.</span> <span data-start="384.5" data-end="388.78">It sounds like a lot, but we have a bunch of features coming out, and they did a good</span> <span data-start="388.78" data-end="391.99">job of bringing them over into stage four.</span> <span data-start="391.99" data-end="399.139">So, let's go ahead and jump into the minor features.</span> <span data-start="399.139" data-end="405.089">First, I just want to let you know what we are going to do is basically give a little</span> <span data-start="405.089" data-end="410.349">high-level what the feature is, the name of it, who brought it to â€” who is the champion</span> <span data-start="410.349" data-end="416.939">of it, or the champions, and then a little code snippet and a little bit about the compatibility.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.939" data-end="419.969">First, we have trim start and trim end.</span> <span data-start="419.969" data-end="426.09">Has anybody used trim left and right?</span> <span data-start="426.09" data-end="440.779">This is explanatory in a way, taking space away from the start or the finish.</span> <span data-start="440.779" data-end="447.349">This is the new alias because not all languages have a left and right, or they have a left</span> <span data-start="447.349" data-end="450.59">and right, but some have different ways of approaching it.</span> <span data-start="450.59" data-end="456.61">Start in end just make more sense.</span> <span data-start="456.61" data-end="462.059">This helps you classify what is white space as well, what is a hard enter, space, tabs.</span> <span data-start="462.059" data-end="463.9">There is a whole process to it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.9" data-end="466.729">It is as simple as this.</span> <span data-start="466.729" data-end="470.539">You're taking a string that has spaces around it.</span> <span data-start="470.539" data-end="476.139">A use case of this, say, you're filling out a form, and basically, how it goes is maybe</span> <span data-start="476.139" data-end="480.77">in a CSC you're getting too many extra spaces, so you need to trim it down.</span> <span data-start="480.77" data-end="483.08">You get trim start and trim end.</span> <span data-start="483.08" data-end="488.36">You see, start, finish, and then trim takes both off.</span> <span data-start="488.36" data-end="496.719">There you can see the compatibility is good across the board, i.e. it's a no.</span> <span data-start="496.719" data-end="498.86">Who would have thunk!</span> <span data-start="498.86" data-end="501.219">A simple prototyped description.</span> <span data-start="501.219" data-end="513.14">This is a string parameter that you can pass on to symbol.</span> <span data-start="513.14" data-end="520.99">When they made this, their thought was to help teams communicate across code and communicate</span> <span data-start="520.99" data-end="523.01">their intention for the code.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="523.01" data-end="532.28">I read a comment by Grassbury said we now not use documentation for this?</span> <span data-start="532.28" data-end="542.59">I think the more place we put in code that isn't comments, the better.</span> <span data-start="542.59" data-end="544.75">You be the judge.</span> <span data-start="544.75" data-end="546.56">This is what it looks like.</span> <span data-start="546.56" data-end="548.15">We have created a symbol.</span> <span data-start="548.15" data-end="550.71">We have passed into a string which is now the description.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="550.71" data-end="558.46">When we log it out, we have symbol log that contains that parameter or use the getter.description</span> <span data-start="558.46" data-end="561.76">and get that string.</span> <span data-start="561.76" data-end="564.43">This again is pretty available.</span> <span data-start="564.43" data-end="572.35">I got these compatibility charts from MDM, because they fit really well in slides!</span> <span data-start="572.35" data-end="575.76">But, some of the information wasn't exactly right.</span> <span data-start="575.76" data-end="583.4">Like this is available in Node 11, and they had it as marked as "no" but then I realised</span> <span data-start="583.4" data-end="588.91">above their compatibility charts, they have a link to GitHub, so you can correct any compatibility</span> <span data-start="588.91" data-end="590.65">errors that you see.</span> <span data-start="590.65" data-end="593.28">We just have to be proactive.</span> <span data-start="593.28" data-end="594.97">Okay.</span> <span data-start="594.97" data-end="597.7">Optional catch binding.</span> <span data-start="597.7" data-end="602.19">Do people here use try catch much?</span> <span data-start="602.19" data-end="615.95">It's in the catch clause having a parameter to bind to the exception.</span> <span data-start="615.95" data-end="620.75">A lot of people were using this and throwing it away, because it would cause an error if</span> <span data-start="620.75" data-end="623.05">you didn't have this parameter.</span> <span data-start="623.05" data-end="631.2">A common use case for this is say if you're using json.parse, and you know it's going</span> <span data-start="631.2" data-end="635.11">to throw an error if it is not json, but you don't care about the error, but want it to</span> <span data-start="635.11" data-end="637.47">parse anything that is JSON.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="637.47" data-end="641.66">You throw it, log it, you don't think about it.</span> <span data-start="641.66" data-end="648.76">In their minds, this was superfluous.</span> <span data-start="648.76" data-end="651.02">Who has time for extra key strokes?</span> <span data-start="651.02" data-end="662.56">This ended up being one of the most controversial minor features, but we will get to that later.</span> <span data-start="662.56" data-end="665.78">This is what basically it looks like.</span> <span data-start="665.78" data-end="671.52">You're passing a parameter to your catch clause, and then usually, you want to log it out,</span> <span data-start="671.52" data-end="673.27">and do something with it.</span> <span data-start="673.27" data-end="679.16">Now you can pass up that parameter completely.</span> <span data-start="679.16" data-end="683.09">It is again, you can see the chart.</span> <span data-start="683.09" data-end="687.24">I could also just pause and let you look at the chart for is a second instead of talking</span> <span data-start="687.24" data-end="688.24">over it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="688.24" data-end="696.5">This is where you know that it is an interesting situation when the most active issue just</span> <span data-start="696.5" data-end="699.59">says why?</span> <span data-start="699.59" data-end="712.87">So, a lot of what I do is read through issues, be it like with Node modules, or with ECMAScript.</span> <span data-start="712.87" data-end="719.79">Even as a society, like you in a society, these are some really, really interesting</span> <span data-start="719.79" data-end="725.85">thoughts going into how we build our and standardise our language.</span> <span data-start="725.85" data-end="732.17">Like it's very inspiring to see how much people care about it, because we use it every day,</span> <span data-start="732.17" data-end="733.17">right?</span> <span data-start="733.17" data-end="735.33">So, I highly recommend looking into this.</span> <span data-start="735.33" data-end="740.85">Basically, how it started, as the person who opened the issue, saying that they were pretty</span> <span data-start="740.85" data-end="744.29">scared, let me just say, what he said, they were pretty scared that allowing this may</span> <span data-start="744.29" data-end="746.24">make devs forget about error-handling.</span> <span data-start="746.24" data-end="751.24">Does everyone here do a good job handling their errors?</span> <span data-start="751.24" data-end="752.84">Silence.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.84" data-end="759.17">So, this is basically, he was saying it's making production code untraceable, and that</span> <span data-start="759.17" data-end="762.39">he thinks that errors should be logged, and we should be considering these errors.</span> <span data-start="762.39" data-end="764.04">We should not be swallowing them.</span> <span data-start="764.04" data-end="769.88">It could lead to messy coding, irresponsible coding.</span> <span data-start="769.88" data-end="777.56">And a few things of the comeback is basically that this is making it more intentional, so,</span> <span data-start="777.56" data-end="780.33">if you're leaving off the parameter, you know you're leaving off the parameter.</span> <span data-start="780.33" data-end="785.071">Conduct and Competence Committee be even riskier to leave it so that people automatically throw</span> <span data-start="785.071" data-end="789.18">that log and don't think of it.</span> <span data-start="789.18" data-end="795.73">And there are some cases where you, it's what you are getting back, you can't log, or it's</span> <span data-start="795.73" data-end="801.59">just holds up the programme, so, what you're doing here is kind of taking the road of the</span> <span data-start="801.59" data-end="808.55">least evil, one may say, and you're quietly swallowing your errors, and your application</span> <span data-start="808.55" data-end="813.16">can perform its main job, and you're not compromising the ability to troubleshoot.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="813.16" data-end="815.05">Like, you can always add this.</span> <span data-start="815.05" data-end="818.09">It's not an option that you can no longer add the parameter.</span> <span data-start="818.09" data-end="825.28">Okay, so, we will go at a quicker pace to get you all moving.</span> <span data-start="825.28" data-end="828.12">But, prototype.sort is now stable.</span> <span data-start="828.12" data-end="832.62">This is ECMAScript spec and it made me immediately wonder what is stable?</span> <span data-start="832.62" data-end="840.28">This is basically a stable sorting algorithm if you're take, looking at a list that have</span> <span data-start="840.28" data-end="845.8">their two keys, they have the same value, they should, after a sort in the same order</span> <span data-start="845.8" data-end="848.01">which I will show you in the code.</span> <span data-start="848.01" data-end="855.72">One quick note, no-one intended, but this, cut to the quick, is intended, it's getting</span> <span data-start="855.72" data-end="863.66">rid of quick sort and instead using Trim sort, made by Tim Peters in 2002, and he's making</span> <span data-start="863.66" data-end="872.96">it more proficient by using binary insertion sort and improving the merge sort, which actually</span> <span data-start="872.96" data-end="879.03">allows it to work way better with the arrays that are already sorted.</span> <span data-start="879.03" data-end="884.09">So it is a very interesting read, and another one that I highly remedying into one day while</span> <span data-start="884.09" data-end="886.85">you're waiting for the bus already or on the train.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="967.46" data-end="970.23">There is more to it.</span> <span data-start="970.23" data-end="973.66">With map where U getting one output element.</span> <span data-start="973.66" data-end="975.2">It returns a single value.</span> <span data-start="975.2" data-end="981.01">With Platt map, it's translated to zero or more output elements.</span> <span data-start="981.01" data-end="986.79">It can also return non-array values, but that is less common.</span> <span data-start="986.79" data-end="990.49">Then there is my favourite part of it which is smooshgate?</span> <span data-start="990.49" data-end="995.97">Did anybody hear about that?</span> <span data-start="995.97" data-end="1000.87">Again, we go to the T after the code.</span> <span data-start="1000.87" data-end="1007.9">First of all, with flat in general, you see we have an array with a nested array, with</span> <span data-start="1007.9" data-end="1008.9">an array inside of it.</span> <span data-start="1008.9" data-end="1010.3">There are three levels here.</span> <span data-start="1010.3" data-end="1014.83">If we do flat, it defaults to one layer, and you have the array that is still nested in</span> <span data-start="1014.83" data-end="1015.83">there.</span> <span data-start="1015.83" data-end="1022.1">If we pass to that original array, it nests it all down, or flattens it down to one.</span> </p>
