<p><span data-start="47.769" data-end="49.989">Yama's started as a pretty standard</span> <span data-start="49.989" data-end="53.62">rails app but as we start to scale our</span> <span data-start="53.62" data-end="55.21">project and add features we found that</span> <span data-start="55.21" data-end="57.909">we hit skating problems pretty soon so</span> <span data-start="57.909" data-end="59.049">he needs to rethink parts of our</span> <span data-start="59.049" data-end="62.17">architecture we started by extracting</span> <span data-start="62.17" data-end="63.94">messaging service called fede which we</span> <span data-start="63.94" data-end="66.61">built on the JVM so one of the first</span> <span data-start="66.61" data-end="68.89">game cross we hit was with our how he's</span> <span data-start="68.89" data-end="71.11">storing messages we actually got to over</span> <span data-start="71.11" data-end="73.42">a billion rows in Postgres in our</span> <span data-start="73.42" data-end="75.67">message table so we clearly need to</span> <span data-start="75.67" data-end="77.79">rethink how we did this and we</span> <span data-start="77.79" data-end="80.59">implemented fede but to represent a</span> <span data-start="80.59" data-end="82.93">scalable representation of conversations</span> <span data-start="82.93" data-end="85.6">using just the message IDs and then the</span> <span data-start="85.6" data-end="87.01">actual content of the messages was</span> <span data-start="87.01" data-end="90.579">stored in rails still so whilst that</span> <span data-start="90.579" data-end="92.829">didn't change things that much moving</span> <span data-start="92.829" data-end="94.63">this stuff out into a separate service</span> <span data-start="94.63" data-end="96.909">and a separate data store allow us to</span> <span data-start="96.909" data-end="98.35">dramatically reduce the load on our</span> <span data-start="98.35" data-end="100.03">rails app and also reduce the amount of</span> <span data-start="100.03" data-end="101.74">stuff we need to store in our Postgres</span> <span data-start="101.74" data-end="105.81">database so fitti worked really well and</span> <span data-start="105.81" data-end="109.39">as we have continued to scale our system</span> <span data-start="109.39" data-end="111.909">and add new features we've essentially</span> <span data-start="111.909" data-end="113.829">fought that same approach so we now have</span> <span data-start="113.829" data-end="117.34">over 20 services say things like farvel</span> <span data-start="117.34" data-end="119.92">which is our upload service mug shot</span> <span data-start="119.92" data-end="123.39">which resizes images paddy which is a</span> <span data-start="123.39" data-end="127.719">like collaborative editor thing and this</span> <span data-start="127.719" data-end="129.039">is provide us with quite a few benefits</span> <span data-start="129.039" data-end="131.53">so the most obvious one probably is</span> <span data-start="131.53" data-end="133.3">being able to horizontally scale each</span> <span data-start="133.3" data-end="135.4">service independently so we need to add</span> <span data-start="135.4" data-end="137.68">capacity for fede we can do that really</span> <span data-start="137.68" data-end="139.96">easily without increasing capacity over</span> <span data-start="139.96" data-end="142.48">the whole system it's also nice to</span> <span data-start="142.48" data-end="145.33">separate concerns so understanding what</span> <span data-start="145.33" data-end="147.64">each service does is much easier as it's</span> <span data-start="147.64" data-end="149.38">a separate code base then it would be if</span> <span data-start="149.38" data-end="152.319">it was part of the like one massive</span> <span data-start="152.319" data-end="155.35">repository and it's also much easier to</span> <span data-start="155.35" data-end="157.06">deploy these things so if we make a</span> <span data-start="157.06" data-end="158.69">change to mug shot we can</span> <span data-start="158.69" data-end="160.91">deploy that one service without having</span> <span data-start="160.91" data-end="162.5">to take the risk of deploying the entire</span> <span data-start="162.5" data-end="167.33">system and finally it also improves the</span> <span data-start="167.33" data-end="170.18">full torrents of Yama so if one service</span> <span data-start="170.18" data-end="172.34">goes down ideally at least it shouldn't</span> <span data-start="172.34" data-end="173.75">bring other things down with it it</span> <span data-start="173.75" data-end="176.06">should be separated whereas if you have</span> <span data-start="176.06" data-end="178.37">a single app then that's a single point</span> <span data-start="178.37" data-end="179.99">of failure and if that goes down then</span> <span data-start="179.99" data-end="181.79">there's not very much you can do by</span> <span data-start="181.79" data-end="183.53">separating things out into different</span> <span data-start="183.53" data-end="186.62">services it's allowed us to degrade</span> <span data-start="186.62" data-end="191.06">gracefully when things go wrong so this</span> <span data-start="191.06" data-end="192.89">is a little out of date actually but it</span> <span data-start="192.89" data-end="194">gives you a rough idea of what our</span> <span data-start="194" data-end="196.94">architecture looks like and it also show</span> <span data-start="196.94" data-end="198.11">you some of the problems with this so</span> <span data-start="198.11" data-end="201.74">whilst building things in a</span> <span data-start="201.74" data-end="203.36">service-oriented ways give us a lot</span> <span data-start="203.36" data-end="205.96">benefits it does it does definitely</span> <span data-start="205.96" data-end="208.16">increase the complexity of the system as</span> <span data-start="208.16" data-end="208.61">a whole</span> <span data-start="208.61" data-end="210.35">so each service is easier to understand</span> <span data-start="210.35" data-end="212.6">but that largely just pushes stuff out</span> <span data-start="212.6" data-end="216.77">into complications with how things</span> <span data-start="216.77" data-end="217.97">communicate with each other and how</span> <span data-start="217.97" data-end="220.48">those services are coordinated</span> <span data-start="220.48" data-end="223.16">maintaining API contracts is also much</span> <span data-start="223.16" data-end="224.989">more difficult because you might make a</span> <span data-start="224.989" data-end="227.27">change in one part of the system and it</span> <span data-start="227.27" data-end="231.32">will have very big profound problems in</span> <span data-start="231.32" data-end="232.25">other parts system that you weren't</span> <span data-start="232.25" data-end="236.06">aware would would be affected and this</span> <span data-start="236.06" data-end="237.98">also relates to debugging so when you</span> <span data-start="237.98" data-end="240.62">get a bug reports tracing those symptoms</span> <span data-start="240.62" data-end="242.27">back to the actual root cause is far</span> <span data-start="242.27" data-end="244.04">more difficult because instead of it</span> <span data-start="244.04" data-end="247.34">being due to a nicely isolated part of</span> <span data-start="247.34" data-end="249.38">the system is usually a result of lots</span> <span data-start="249.38" data-end="251.15">of things interacting together and</span> <span data-start="251.15" data-end="253.43">causing a problem and then finally</span> <span data-start="253.43" data-end="256.31">handling failing dependencies really</span> <span data-start="256.31" data-end="258.41">needs to be thought of upfront so the</span> <span data-start="258.41" data-end="259.88">fault tolerance I mentioned on the</span> <span data-start="259.88" data-end="261.68">previous slide doesn't really come for</span> <span data-start="261.68" data-end="263.06">free you've got to think about how to</span> <span data-start="263.06" data-end="266.03">handle the dependencies of each service</span> <span data-start="266.03" data-end="268.22">when they go down because if you don't</span> <span data-start="268.22" data-end="270.14">that will also bring your own service</span> <span data-start="270.14" data-end="272.06">down and they'll potentially cascade to</span> <span data-start="272.06" data-end="275.18">the rest of the system so to look at</span> <span data-start="275.18" data-end="276.26">this in a bit more detail we're going to</span> <span data-start="276.26" data-end="278.3">take a look at our completely service</span> <span data-start="278.3" data-end="280.4">which is our web service for providing</span> <span data-start="280.4" data-end="283.58">autocomplete results so if you pass the</span> <span data-start="283.58" data-end="286.31">name Bob it would turn all of the Bob's</span> <span data-start="286.31" data-end="289.09">in your network but on a large network</span> <span data-start="289.09" data-end="291.38">that could be hundreds of names and we</span> <span data-start="291.38" data-end="292.28">don't want a force I use</span> <span data-start="292.28" data-end="296.33">to search through that list so we use</span> <span data-start="296.33" data-end="297.92">another service called pranky which rec</span> <span data-start="297.92" data-end="300.95">which ranks things in relation to you so</span> <span data-start="300.95" data-end="305">completely uses this to sort its list</span> <span data-start="305" data-end="306.8">based on how likely you are to want to</span> <span data-start="306.8" data-end="308.54">come to that person and then passes back</span> <span data-start="308.54" data-end="310.669">the most ten or like ten or twenty most</span> <span data-start="310.669" data-end="314.66">relevant users but with this pattern if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="314.66" data-end="317.24">Frankie goes down then if we don't think</span> <span data-start="317.24" data-end="318.56">about this at all and that's also going</span> <span data-start="318.56" data-end="321.29">to bring down completing if it fails</span> <span data-start="321.29" data-end="323.3">quickly with a 500 error we can at least</span> <span data-start="323.3" data-end="325.19">handle the error normally and continue</span> <span data-start="325.19" data-end="326.44">on</span> <span data-start="326.44" data-end="329.12">but if prank is just unavailable then</span> <span data-start="329.12" data-end="331.19">the request is lighters timeout which</span> <span data-start="331.19" data-end="332.21">means we'll have to wait for that to</span> <span data-start="332.21" data-end="333.41">complete before we can pass any</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="336.65">information back to the user and we also</span> <span data-start="336.65" data-end="338.12">need to do this every time so every time</span> <span data-start="338.12" data-end="339.89">complete it makes a request to Frankie</span> <span data-start="339.89" data-end="342.02">even if we know that's likely to timeout</span> <span data-start="342.02" data-end="344.12">we still need to make that call and wait</span> <span data-start="344.12" data-end="345.86">for it to fail before we can actually</span> <span data-start="345.86" data-end="349.16">continue and worse than that if anything</span> <span data-start="349.16" data-end="350.9">actually relies on completely then this</span> <span data-start="350.9" data-end="353.09">latency could cause failures which then</span> <span data-start="353.09" data-end="354.5">start to cascade through the rest of the</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="357.32">system so one way of dealing with this</span> <span data-start="357.32" data-end="359.57">is the circuit breaker pattern circuit</span> <span data-start="359.57" data-end="362.72">breaker pattern monsters requests being</span> <span data-start="362.72" data-end="364.58">made between services and records any</span> <span data-start="364.58" data-end="366.68">errors that are thrown and if enough</span> <span data-start="366.68" data-end="368.33">errors a throne to go over a specified</span> <span data-start="368.33" data-end="371.33">error threshold then the circuit breaker</span> <span data-start="371.33" data-end="373.37">is broken at that point or requests a</span> <span data-start="373.37" data-end="374.69">short-circuit didn't don't actually get</span> <span data-start="374.69" data-end="377.86">passed on to the service we then allow</span> <span data-start="377.86" data-end="380.66">periodic retries to test the current</span> <span data-start="380.66" data-end="382.729">health of the system so we don't want to</span> <span data-start="382.729" data-end="385.58">permanently disable a feature for</span> <span data-start="385.58" data-end="389.15">example so in our example the circuit</span> <span data-start="389.15" data-end="390.86">breaker was sit between completing and</span> <span data-start="390.86" data-end="393.53">pranking and as long as these requests</span> <span data-start="393.53" data-end="395.15">are successful they'll just get passed</span> <span data-start="395.15" data-end="398">through you as normal but if Frankie</span> <span data-start="398" data-end="401.479">goes down then it will let a few more</span> <span data-start="401.479" data-end="402.5">requests through but it will record</span> <span data-start="402.5" data-end="404">those as errors and once enough errors</span> <span data-start="404" data-end="406.25">have come through it will go over the</span> <span data-start="406.25" data-end="407.6">error threshold and it will open the</span> <span data-start="407.6" data-end="410.93">circuit breaker so at that point it will</span> <span data-start="410.93" data-end="413.45">short-circuit the requests and they</span> <span data-start="413.45" data-end="415.1">won't actually get passed on to Frankie</span> <span data-start="415.1" data-end="417.47">this allows completed to fail fast and</span> <span data-start="417.47" data-end="420.26">not wait for timeouts to occur and you</span> <span data-start="420.26" data-end="422.15">can actually then specify fallback which</span> <span data-start="422.15" data-end="423.289">will happen in that case</span> <span data-start="423.289" data-end="425.66">so in completely sense it will</span> <span data-start="425.66" data-end="428.729">just return the unsorted list of results</span> <span data-start="428.729" data-end="430.11">which obviously isn't as good as</span> <span data-start="430.11" data-end="432.389">returning more relevant results but at</span> <span data-start="432.389" data-end="434.19">least means that our application can</span> <span data-start="434.19" data-end="436.259">continue to function in some way when</span> <span data-start="436.259" data-end="438.139">there's a failure in part of our system</span> <span data-start="438.139" data-end="440.43">it'll just have some other benefits they</span> <span data-start="440.43" data-end="442.65">burst and they were handling in that you</span> <span data-start="442.65" data-end="444.6">can report when a circuit breaker is</span> <span data-start="444.6" data-end="446.37">opened and then logs out somewhere so</span> <span data-start="446.37" data-end="448.289">you can get idea of when your system is</span> <span data-start="448.289" data-end="450.87">facing problems and it also prevents you</span> <span data-start="450.87" data-end="452.34">from hammering the same service when</span> <span data-start="452.34" data-end="454.11">it's already down which will make it far</span> <span data-start="454.11" data-end="455.699">more difficult to recover when there is</span> <span data-start="455.699" data-end="459.06">a problem so we use hysterics on our</span> <span data-start="459.06" data-end="460.889">back-end services which is a Java</span> <span data-start="460.889" data-end="463.68">library built by Netflix there's a few</span> <span data-start="463.68" data-end="464.94">really good blog post about how its work</span> <span data-start="464.94" data-end="467.699">and the documentation is really great so</span> <span data-start="467.699" data-end="470.91">it's free easy to see what it's doing it</span> <span data-start="470.91" data-end="472.83">also has a sister project which provides</span> <span data-start="472.83" data-end="474.51">the real-time dashboards so this will</span> <span data-start="474.51" data-end="477.84">log when any circuit breakers are opened</span> <span data-start="477.84"

data-end="497.4">would did when Frankie went down we'll</span> <span data-start="497.4" data-end="499.68">have timeouts delaying user interaction</span> <span data-start="499.68" data-end="501.06">and we won't actually know that</span> <span data-start="501.06" data-end="502.59">completey has gone down potentially if</span> <span data-start="502.59" data-end="505.169">it's in a recoverable State so we really</span> <span data-start="505.169" data-end="506.88">need something to sit between browser</span> <span data-start="506.88" data-end="508.86">requests and completing to monitor</span> <span

data-end="552.06">keep track of these results for a</span> <span data-start="552.06" data-end="554.31">certain amount of time which we call the</span> <span data-start="554.31" data-end="556.41">window which in our example is 10</span> <span data-start="556.41" data-end="559.26">seconds we divided the window into</span> <span data-start="559.26" data-end="561.6">buckets in this case into ten buckets so</span> <span data-start="561.6" data-end="564.66">we have each bucket containing one</span> <span data-start="564.66" data-end="569.01">second of command executions what</span> <span data-start="569.01" data-end="571.65">happens is that every second an old</span> <span data-start="571.65" data-end="574.8">bucket rolls off the window and the new</span> <span data-start="574.8" data-end="578.04">bucket rolls in so we're only keeping</span> <span data-start="578.04" data-end="579.9">track of the last 10 seconds of</span> <span data-start="579.9" data-end="583.89">executions the values in these buckets</span> <span data-start="583.89" data-end="586.89">determine if the circuit breaker is open</span> <span data-start="586.89" data-end="589.59">or closed so what we do is after every</span> <span data-start="589.59" data-end="592.08">command we calculate the percentage of</span> <span data-start="592.08" data-end="594.29">failed requests so we sum up the</span> <span data-start="594.29" data-end="596.79">failures and timeouts and divide it by</span> <span data-start="596.79" data-end="599.79">the total number of executions and that</span> <span data-start="599.79" data-end="601.77">gives us the error percentage if the</span> <span data-start="601.77" data-end="604.08">error percentage is under a certain</span> <span data-start="604.08" data-end="607.35">threshold which may be 50% so if the</span> <span data-start="607.35" data-end="611.31">error percentage is under 50% then we</span> <span data-start="611.31" data-end="613.5">let the circuit breaker closed and</span> <span data-start="613.5" data-end="616.71">commands execute normally but if the</span> <span data-start="616.71" data-end="618.75">error percentage is over the threshold</span> <span data-start="618.75" data-end="620.91">then the circuit breaker will open and</span> <span data-start="620.91" data-end="623.49">any commands that come after this one</span> <span data-start="623.49" data-end="628.08">will fail instantly but the service may</span> <span data-start="628.08" data-end="630.75">recover at some point so every once in a</span> <span data-start="630.75" data-end="633.75">while we have to check the status of the</span> <span data-start="633.75" data-end="637.23">service somehow what we do is after the</span> <span data-start="637.23" data-end="640.02">circuit breaker has opened we let we</span> <span data-start="640.02" data-end="643.11">wait for one full window so in our</span> <span data-start="643.11" data-end="645.57">example that was 10 seconds so we wait</span> <span data-start="645.57" data-end="648.3">for 10 seconds and then we let a single</span> <span data-start="648.3" data-end="651.27">command execute if the service is still</span> <span data-start="651.27" data-end="653.85">down and the command fails then the</span> <span data-start="653.85" data-end="656.67">circuit breaker will remain open but if</span> <span data-start="656.67" data-end="660.24">the service has recovered and the</span> <span data-start="660.24" data-end="663.51">command executed successfully then the</span> <span data-start="663.51" data-end="665.31">circuit breaker will become closed and</span> <span data-start="665.31" data-end="667.08">any commands that come after this one</span> <span data-start="667.08" data-end="671.97">will execute normally the API is really</span> <span data-start="671.97" data-end="672.6">straightforward</span> <span data-start="672.6" data-end="675.36">so you just instantiate a new circuit</span> <span data-start="675.36" data-end="677.58">breaker for your service here we have</span> <span data-start="677.58" data-end="680.67">completely breaker and we pass the</span> <span data-start="680.67" data-end="683.1">necessary configuration so here we're</span> <span data-start="683.1" data-end="685.44">saying that the length of the window is</span> <span data-start="685.44" data-end="688.41">10 seconds we're dividing that window</span> <span data-start="688.41" data-end="690.81">into 10 buckets we're also saying that</span> <span data-start="690.81" data-end="692.819">the timeout duration is 3</span> <span data-start="692.819" data-end="694.589">seconds which I'll explain in the next</span> <span data-start="694.589" data-end="697.439">slide we're also setting the error</span> <span data-start="697.439" data-end="700.199">threshold to 50% so when we calculate</span> <span data-start="700.199" data-end="702.6">the error percentage for a window if</span> <span data-start="702.6" data-end="704.579">it's over this threshold then the</span> <span data-start="704.579" data-end="707.1">circuit breaker will open and we're also</span> <span data-start="707.1" data-end="710.16">setting a volume threshold which is the</span> <span data-start="710.16" data-end="712.169">minimum number of commands that have to</span> <span data-start="712.169" data-end="714.299">execute before we start calculating</span> <span data-start="714.299" data-end="717.019">stats and why is this even necessary</span> <span data-start="717.019" data-end="720.419">well imagine if you instantiate a new</span> <span data-start="720.419" data-end="722.549">circuit breaker and the first command</span> <span data-start="722.549" data-end="725.22">that you execute happens to fail then</span> <span data-start="725.22" data-end="726.359">you would have a one hundred percent</span> <span data-start="726.359" data-end="729.029">error rate and the circuit breaker would</span> <span data-start="729.029" data-end="730.919">open immediately so you want to avoid</span> <span data-start="730.919" data-end="733.139">that situation and that's why we have</span> <span data-start="733.139" data-end="736.229">the volume threshold we wait for in this</span> <span data-start="736.229" data-end="738.299">example five commands to execute and</span> <span data-start="738.299" data-end="744.689">then we start calculating the stats so</span> <span data-start="744.689" data-end="747.029">now we have our circuit breaker and we</span> <span data-start="747.029" data-end="748.709">want to run commands through it a</span> <span data-start="748.709" data-end="750.839">command is just a function which</span> <span data-start="750.839" data-end="752.549">receives a success and a failure</span> <span data-start="752.549" data-end="755.999">callback and you can do whatever you</span> <span data-start="755.999" data-end="758.399">need to do inside that function and then</span> <span data-start="758.399" data-end="760.079">you just need to notify the circuit</span> <span data-start="760.079" data-end="762.509">breaker of the result so here we're</span> <span data-start="762.509" data-end="765.089">calling completely results which is</span> <span data-start="765.089" data-end="767.1">probably making an ajax request</span> <span data-start="767.1" data-end="769.409">if the request is successful we call the</span> <span data-start="769.409" data-end="771.359">success callback if it fails we call the</span> <span data-start="771.359" data-end="774.659">failure callback and this is where the</span> <span data-start="774.659" data-end="777.959">timeout comes into play if neither the</span> <span data-start="777.959" data-end="779.879">success nor the failure callbacks are</span> <span data-start="779.879" data-end="782.549">called after three seconds then we flag</span> <span data-start="782.549" data-end="786.299">this command as a timeout so we have our</span> <span data-start="786.299" data-end="788.249">command to run it through the circuit</span> <span data-start="788.249" data-end="790.259">breaker we just call breaker that run</span> <span data-start="790.259" data-end="793.47">and we pass the command we can also pass</span> <span data-start="793.47" data-end="795.389">an optional second parameter which is</span> <span data-start="795.389" data-end="797.97">the fallback which only gets executed if</span> <span data-start="797.97" data-end="800.609">the circuit breaker is open so if the</span> <span data-start="800.609" data-end="803.279">circuit has broken it keeps the command</span> <span data-start="803.279" data-end="805.199">execution and invokes the fallback</span> <span data-start="805.199" data-end="807.779">directly in the fallback you can call</span> <span data-start="807.779" data-end="810.449">some other service or maybe let the user</span> <span data-start="810.449" data-end="814.229">know that the system is in a Down State</span> <span data-start="814.229" data-end="817.709">and after the command has run we update</span> <span data-start="817.709" data-end="821.909">the statistics and set the state of the</span> <span data-start="821.909" data-end="824.069">circuit breaker to be open or closed and</span> <span data-start="824.069" data-end="828.5">that's it really it's pretty simple</span> <span data-start="828.5" data-end="833.31">all right so in summary circuit breakers</span> <span data-start="833.31" data-end="834.69">allow you to fail fast when there's a</span> <span data-start="834.69" data-end="836.91">problem and degrade gracefully to other</span> <span data-start="836.91" data-end="839.91">solutions they can prevent failures</span> <span data-start="839.91" data-end="841.26">cascading through your the rest of your</span> <span data-start="841.26" data-end="842.76">system so you isolate points of</span> <span data-start="842.76" data-end="845.82">communication to prevent problems going</span> <span data-start="845.82" data-end="848.07">through to other services and they let</span> <span data-start="848.07" data-end="849.96">you discover any problems early and</span> <span data-start="849.96" data-end="851.55">allow you to more easily recover when</span> <span data-start="851.55" data-end="855.06">they do happen and that's it so yeah</span> <span data-start="855.06" data-end="863.46">give any questions or that trip pretty</span> <span data-start="863.46" data-end="864.03">cool</span> <span data-start="864.03" data-end="866.28">sitting beside Brian here and he had a</span> <span data-start="866.28" data-end="869.16">question can you go back to that diagram</span> <span data-start="869.16" data-end="881.14">of services that you have on your slides</span> <span data-start="881.15" data-end="883.89">is nothing connected to Wario because</span> <span data-start="883.89" data-end="886.73">he's a jerk</span> <span data-start="886.74" data-end="889.83">what is why are you I think it's only</span> <span data-start="889.83" data-end="892.68">accessed by the browser right let's say</span> <span data-start="892.68" data-end="900.26">it doesn't appear never fails yeah</span> <span data-start="900.26" data-end="903.21">already exists in the browser sounds</span> <span data-start="903.21" data-end="903.89">about right</span> <span data-start="903.89" data-end="907.71">any other questions oh we're five</span> <span data-start="907.71" data-end="911.01">minutes late really no no we're breaking</span> <span data-start="911.01" data-end="912.66">until four I think so we got a shitload</span> <span data-start="912.66" data-end="914.7">of time I'm basically just eating time</span> <span data-start="914.7" data-end="921.33">right now cool all right thanks guys</span> <span data-start="921.33" data-end="932.41">we'll be back at 4:00</span> </p>
