data-end="363.18">use CSS so that's cool so one of the</span> <span data-start="363.18" data-end="364.289">ways you can use these to indenture</span> <span data-start="364.289" data-end="367.169">paragraphs you just take like a short</span> <span data-start="367.169" data-end="369.93">and long gift it's invisible you put it</span> <span data-start="369.93" data-end="371.669">in front of your your paragraph it works</span> <span data-start="371.669" data-end="372.87">fine there was no other way of doing</span> <span data-start="372.87" data-end="374.699">this at the time you could add extra</span> <span data-start="374.699" data-end="376.02">spaces but then the white space was</span> <span data-start="376.02" data-end="378.479">cancelled out so this is kind of the way</span> <span data-start="378.479" data-end="379.74">it worked well except for the fact you</span> <span data-start="379.74" data-end="381">had to put it in front of every</span> <span data-start="381" data-end="383.759">paragraph and now you can just do that</span> <span data-start="383.759" data-end="385.919">with like text indent with CSS it's</span> <span data-start="385.919" data-end="390.449">beautiful you can do eam dashes you just</span> <span data-start="390.449" data-end="392.55">make it a visible gift and you stick it</span> <span data-start="392.55" data-end="393.99">in there now there's no that you could</span> <span data-start="393.99" data-end="395.69">do like to text ashes there were no</span> <span data-start="395.69" data-end="397.94">there wasn't a good way of doing this</span> <span data-start="397.94" data-end="400.5">and you could type</span> <span data-start="400.5" data-end="401.67">the good there's no space between</span> <span data-start="401.67" data-end="403.71">letters it's supposed to be it's like</span> <span data-start="403.71" data-end="404.97">how it's supposed to be from a</span> <span data-start="404.97" data-end="407.37">typographer standpoint it just wreaks</span> <span data-start="407.37" data-end="409.56">havoc on like copy paste and it's it's</span> <span data-start="409.56" data-end="412.56">weird now we have htmlentities you can</span> <span data-start="412.56" data-end="415.97">just drop in and and it works great</span> <span data-start="415.97" data-end="418.71">wasn't there back then you can control</span> <span data-start="418.71" data-end="420.6">line spacing so same thing as the</span> <span data-start="420.6" data-end="423.92">paragraph indent just you know vertical</span> <span data-start="423.92" data-end="427.44">and I should at this time point out that</span> <span data-start="427.44" data-end="429.54">the the V space and via line we have</span> <span data-start="429.54" data-end="430.95">there they don't work anymore not in</span> <span data-start="430.95" data-end="433.29">html5 but they would basically just add</span> <span data-start="433.29" data-end="436.68">spaces on the sides of them you can fake</span> <span data-start="436.68" data-end="438.06">it with width and height by the way</span> <span data-start="438.06" data-end="439.73">which is how I got this to render at all</span> <span data-start="439.73" data-end="442.08">so this works great there's another way</span> <span data-start="442.08" data-end="443.28">of doing this you could maybe at most</span> <span data-start="443.28" data-end="446.06">like double space your lines and stuff</span> <span data-start="446.06" data-end="448.47">but this gave you precise control of</span> <span data-start="448.47" data-end="451.2">your line spacing now you just use line</span> <span data-start="451.2" data-end="453.84">spacing it works really well this is</span> <span data-start="453.84" data-end="456.48">more of the other things were kind of</span> <span data-start="456.48" data-end="457.53">forgivable there's another way of doing</span> <span data-start="457.53" data-end="459.66">this is kind of like a what are you even</span> <span data-start="459.66"
