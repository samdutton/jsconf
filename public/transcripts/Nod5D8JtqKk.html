data-start="592.3" data-end="595.51">create art in the browser and so the way</span> <span data-start="595.51" data-end="596.92">it works is it makes it easy to work</span> <span data-start="596.92"

data-start="621.52" data-end="624.73">and so some of you have already like I</span> <span data-start="624.73" data-end="626.59">had you guys raise your hand and see who</span> <span data-start="626.59" data-end="629.92">had already who DS processing so p5 is</span> <span data-start="629.92" data-end="633.13">actually based on processing so</span> <span data-start="633.13" data-end="635.71">processing is an IDE it's based in Java</span> <span data-start="635.71" data-end="637.78">and it's been around for almost two</span> <span data-start="637.78" data-end="639.37">decades now so it's been around for a</span> <span data-start="639.37" data-end="641.77">while and it is sort of like the go-to</span> <span data-start="641.77" data-end="643.39">standard when it comes to creative</span> <span data-start="643.39" data-end="644.98">coding if you do a google search of</span> <span data-start="644.98" data-end="646.089">creative

able to</span> <span data-start="651.16" data-end="653.29">create visualizations super fast and</span> <span data-start="653.29" data-end="655.75">easy without having to learn a lot of</span> <span data-start="655.75" data-end="658.39">like code that wouldn't be helpful</span> <span data-start="658.39" data-end="660.58">within that project and the neat thing</span> <span data-start="660.58" data-end="662.57">about processing is that not</span> <span data-start="662.57" data-end="664.75">only is it easy for beginners to learn</span> <span data-start="664.75" data-end="668.39">it also it's

to bring over sort of the ethos and</span> <span data-start="709.22" data-end="714.34">by that I mean the it's a very inclusive</span> <span data-start="714.34" data-end="718.28">organization and so p5 aims to replicate</span> <span data-start="718.28" data-end="718.49">that</span> <span data-start="718.49" data-end="721.04">so processing talks about how their game</span> <span
