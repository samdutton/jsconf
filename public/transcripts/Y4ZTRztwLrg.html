<p><span data-start="33.56" data-end="35.45">But that's okay.</span> <span data-start="35.45" data-end="38.29">It's not actually broken for most of you JavaScript</span> <span data-start="38.29" data-end="39.29">developers, right?</span> <span data-start="39.29" data-end="43.87">On Firefox and Chrome and Edge, for you, the web is probably</span> <span data-start="43.87" data-end="44.87">still pretty awesome.</span> <span data-start="44.87" data-end="46.86">But for the rest of the world coming online right</span> <span data-start="46.86" data-end="51.839">now, and that's like 2 billion people over the next few years, it really</span> <span data-start="51.839" data-end="54.26">kind of sucks.</span> <span data-start="54.26" data-end="56.73">And that's just because for more and more people, the first</span> <span data-start="56.73" data-end="61.23">and only experience they're ever going to have of the web is mobile.</span> <span data-start="61.23" data-end="65.07">And the mobile web is not good enough.</span> <span data-start="65.07" data-end="67.37">So let's talk about why the mobile web is not</span> <span data-start="67.37" data-end="68.37">good enough.</span> <span data-start="68.37" data-end="70.54">You probably know most of this already.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="70.54" data-end="74.66">The one that you are probably feeling a lot right now is UI</span> <span data-start="74.66" data-end="75.97">perf.</span> <span data-start="75.97" data-end="79.98">Particularly when you're doing things like gestures and lots of layout</span> <span data-start="79.98" data-end="83.16">panes  —  not great.</span> <span data-start="83.16" data-end="84.57">Not as good as we'd like.</span> <span data-start="84.57" data-end="87.16">But there's lots of other things that are broken.</span> <span data-start="87.16" data-end="91.16">The auth model that's based on email doesn't make any sense</span> <span data-start="91.16" data-end="94.31">for new users of the web who don't even have emails.</span> <span data-start="94.31" data-end="98.79">The experience when you go offline or you're on a 3G or less connection</span> <span data-start="98.79" data-end="101.55">is really pretty terrible for most of the web.</span> <span data-start="101.55" data-end="104.33">And of course, all of the access to the OS level device</span> <span data-start="104.33" data-end="109.82">integrations, like push notifications, and camera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.82" data-end="112.28">And on the one hand, that's okay.</span> <span data-start="112.28" data-end="115.85">The web was built for a completely different desktop-based paradigm,</span> <span data-start="115.85" data-end="116.85">right?</span> <span data-start="116.85" data-end="119.34">And it's going to take some time for browsers to work on solutions.</span> <span data-start="119.34" data-end="120.34">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.34" data-end="121.34">That's fine.</span> <span data-start="121.34" data-end="123.99">But on the other hand, it's kind of not okay, because not</span> <span data-start="123.99" data-end="127.9">only does the web kind of suck at all these things right now, native platforms</span> <span data-start="127.9" data-end="130.17">are actually really good at them.</span> <span data-start="130.17" data-end="133.45">And there's some technical reasons why performance and other things are easy to get</span> <span data-start="133.45" data-end="135.45">right on native platforms.</span> <span data-start="135.45" data-end="139.16">But the thing with native is it was built with</span> <span data-start="139.16" data-end="145.25">these problems at the center of its business model, and the web was not.</span> <span data-start="145.25" data-end="148.62">So I was actually kind of wondering  —  you know, is this still something that people</span> <span data-start="148.62" data-end="149.62">care about?</span> <span data-start="149.62" data-end="150.859">Are we still talking about this?</span> <span data-start="150.859" data-end="153.53">And it turns out it is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="153.53" data-end="158.099">Just yesterday, actually, one of the leading authorities on browser quirks and</span> <span data-start="158.099" data-end="163.129">compatibility since the '90s, I think  —  he wrote an article on his blog,</span> <span data-start="163.129" data-end="165.56">and it was called web versus native.</span> <span data-start="165.56" data-end="166.56">Let's concede defeat.</span> <span data-start="166.56" data-end="169.069">I want to read this out, because it's important.</span> <span data-start="169.069" data-end="171.76">I feel like it's time to revisit the web versus native</span> <span data-start="171.76" data-end="177.03">debate and concede defeat, that the web should not and cannot compete</span> <span data-start="177.03" data-end="182.01">with native when it comes to complex app-like structures.</span> <span data-start="182.01" data-end="184.349">His argument essentially is that because of the</span> <span data-start="184.349" data-end="188.12">fundamental architectural limitations of how the web was built, we're just</span> <span data-start="188.12" data-end="192.889">going to have to give up on building these rich client app-like experiences</span> <span data-start="192.889" data-end="197.45">and go back to the true strengths of the web, which is URLs, universal</span> <span data-start="197.45" data-end="200.15">accessibility, et cetera.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="200.15" data-end="201.56">And you know what?</span> <span data-start="201.56" data-end="203.279">He has a point.</span> <span data-start="203.279" data-end="205.7">You know, overlooking the fact that there's a few things</span> <span data-start="205.7" data-end="210.739">like offline that still affects the overall interoperability of the web, this</span> <span data-start="210.739" data-end="215.609">is a totally reasonable, rational argument, when you look at the current</span> <span data-start="215.609" data-end="217.209">state of affairs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="217.209" data-end="220.099">And it might actually even be a popular one.</span> <span data-start="220.099" data-end="225.569">Honestly, if what you really want to do right now today is to build the fastest, coolest,</span> <span data-start="225.569" data-end="231.779">most awesome UI, with 3D and games and whatever, I would have to tell you  —  you</span> <span data-start="231.779" data-end="232.779">know what?</span> <span data-start="232.779" data-end="236.29">You should consider building for Android or iOS.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="236.29" data-end="238.469">But if what we're saying  —  that this is the way</span> <span data-start="238.469" data-end="242.879">to fix the mobile web, it's to give up and abandon app-like experiences for</span> <span data-start="242.879" data-end="247.239">something that, you know, works better with our original model of the web, I</span> <span data-start="247.239" data-end="248.359">couldn't disagree more.</span> <span data-start="248.359" data-end="253.79">But to do that, first, I want to take a look back at the year 2004.</span> <span data-start="253.79" data-end="256.62">How many of you were doing web development back in</span> <span data-start="256.62" data-end="257.62">2004?</span> <span data-start="257.62" data-end="258.62">Wow.</span> <span data-start="258.62" data-end="259.62">That's a lot of you.</span> <span data-start="259.62" data-end="260.62">This is awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="260.62" data-end="263.86">So you're totally going to remember some of the stuff I'm going to</span> <span data-start="263.86" data-end="265.85">talk about here.</span> <span data-start="265.85" data-end="266.85">So..</span> <span data-start="266.85" data-end="270.33">Yeah, I was a big fan, actually, of both Britney Spears</span> <span data-start="270.33" data-end="272.15">and Orlando Bloom.</span> <span data-start="272.15" data-end="276.61">According to Google's zeitgeist of the year, they were the</span> <span data-start="276.61" data-end="282.75">two most popular people.</span> <span data-start="282.75" data-end="288.66">The top two tech topics, according to Google analytics, number one was wallpaper.</span> <span data-start="288.66" data-end="292.16">Number two was Kazaa.</span> <span data-start="292.16" data-end="293.21">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="293.21" data-end="297.05">If we were doing JSConf in 2004, that's what we would</span> <span data-start="297.05" data-end="298.59">be talking about.</span> <span data-start="298.59" data-end="299.81">Pretty awesome.</span> <span data-start="299.81" data-end="307.65">So also  —  PHP5 was released that year, Ruby on Rails was at 0.5.0, and Google</span> <span data-start="307.65" data-end="310.53">had been around for about six years already.</span> <span data-start="310.53" data-end="312.71">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.71" data-end="317">So something else happened in 2004.</span> <span data-start="317" data-end="318.59">It was the year  —  actually, it was the year that Facebook</span> <span data-start="318.59" data-end="319.59">was released as well.</span> <span data-start="319.59" data-end="321.67">Although I don't actually remember that.</span> <span data-start="321.67" data-end="323.59">But it was actually the year that Google first released</span> <span data-start="323.59" data-end="325.31">Gmail.</span> <span data-start="325.31" data-end="327.919">And at first, because it was released in April and Google had this</span> <span data-start="327.919" data-end="331.951">reputation for being notorious for April fool's jokes, people thought it was</span> <span data-start="331.951" data-end="333.699">maybe a joke.</span> <span data-start="333.699" data-end="337.74">Does anybody remember when Gmail came out?</span> <span data-start="337.74" data-end="339.569">Were you signed up for Gmail?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.569" data-end="340.659">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="340.659" data-end="343.64">I don't remember it being as cool as people said it was.</span> <span data-start="343.64" data-end="344.64">But it was..</span> <span data-start="344.64" data-end="346.11">I guess was pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="346.11" data-end="350.169">It was a real thing, and it was cool for two</span> <span data-start="350.169" data-end="351.169">reasons.</span> <span data-start="351.169" data-end="352.169">Okay?</span> <span data-start="352.169" data-end="354.11">One was that it offered a gig of storage.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.11" data-end="357.069">Where all the other online competitors like Hotmail</span> <span data-start="357.069" data-end="362.02">and Yahoo offered way less than that, and the second thing was that Gmail had</span> <span data-start="362.02" data-end="367.13">this super neat interface that could actually live update when you received a</span> <span data-start="367.13" data-end="370.389">new email, without requiring a page refresh.</span> <span data-start="370.389" data-end="373.699">That was super awesome, right?</span> <span data-start="373.699" data-end="378.93">And in 2004, the idea of re-rendering the DOM with new data, after the page had</span> <span data-start="378.93" data-end="380.61">loaded, so like..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="380.61" data-end="384.48">AJAX, was not at all common on the web, nor was it even</span> <span data-start="384.48" data-end="385.949">expected.</span> <span data-start="385.949" data-end="389.889">All the other web email clients were terrible and clunky and</span> <span data-start="389.889" data-end="394.629">required lots of page refreshes, but that was just the way things were.</span> <span data-start="394.629" data-end="397.33">If you wanted an app-like experience, you were expected</span> <span data-start="397.33" data-end="399.33">to use a Windows email client.</span> <span data-start="399.33" data-end="400.33">Right?</span> <span data-start="400.33" data-end="401.909">Pretty reasonable.</span> <span data-start="401.909" data-end="406.039">So when the lead developer of Gmail told his co-workers he was going to write the entire</span> <span data-start="406.039" data-end="412.27">app totally in the browser and almost entirely in JavaScript, they were like..</span> <span data-start="412.27" data-end="413.27">What?</span> <span data-start="413.27" data-end="414.27">Really?</span> <span data-start="414.27" data-end="416.159">You know, in fact, almost everybody he talked to, even</span> <span data-start="416.159" data-end="421.71">internally at Google, especially people who considered themselves to be experts</span> <span data-start="421.71" data-end="425.889">at JavaScript and the web, thought his idea was totally naive, it was</span> <span data-start="425.889" data-end="429.28">never going to work, because people had tried to write complex things in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="429.28" data-end="434.99">before, and they knew the web was just not made to do that kind of stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.99" data-end="437.58">And this was a really common opinion at the time.</span> <span data-start="437.58" data-end="439.28">JavaScript was at best a thing that..</span> <span data-start="439.28" data-end="442.65">You know, could decorate your pages or enhance them a little</span> <span data-start="442.65" data-end="447.36">bit, and at worst, it was a security flaw, it was non-standards compliant,</span> <span data-start="447.36" data-end="450.33">it was disruptive and pretty terrible, right?</span> <span data-start="450.33" data-end="452.86">So I want to show you some things that people were actually</span> <span data-start="452.86" data-end="453.86">writing.</span> <span data-start="453.86" data-end="458.819">I was digging back into the Wayback Machine and some old blogs circa</span> <span data-start="458.819" data-end="460.439">2004.</span> <span data-start="460.439" data-end="462.77">This was from the anti-JavaScript FAQ.</span> <span data-start="462.77" data-end="467.039">While I am personally opposed to all JavaScript, I understand it can do some</span> <span data-start="467.039" data-end="469.25">things that you can't do with normal html.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1218.929" data-end="1220.99">All right.</span> <span data-start="1220.99" data-end="1225.19">But the real magic that happens, though, is you can expose a custom</span> <span data-start="1225.19" data-end="1229.309">Java interface into your JavaScript by attaching it to the window object, and</span> <span data-start="1229.309" data-end="1232.38">that kind of lets you do whatever you want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1232.38" data-end="1234.11">So what does that look like?</span> <span data-start="1234.11" data-end="1237.059">We've got  —  we add JavaScript interface to our</span> <span data-start="1237.059" data-end="1241.1">web view, we basically attach a class to it, and we can add some methods on</span> <span data-start="1241.1" data-end="1242.74">that class.</span> <span data-start="1242.74" data-end="1246.34">And those methods that are declared actually show up on window.Android,</span> <span data-start="1246.34" data-end="1248.809">or whatever  —  we can call it whatever we want.</span> <span data-start="1248.809" data-end="1250.26">I called it Android.</span> <span data-start="1250.26" data-end="1253.41">We can just call those Java functions.</span> <span data-start="1253.41" data-end="1257.779">Of course, you're fairly limited in what kind of data structures you can pass</span> <span data-start="1257.779" data-end="1258.779">through.</span> <span data-start="1258.779" data-end="1260.21">You're going to want to use primitives like strings and stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1260.21" data-end="1263.029">You can't pass full objects or functions around.</span> <span data-start="1263.029" data-end="1264.029">Sorry.</span> <span data-start="1264.029" data-end="1265.029">But..</span> <span data-start="1265.029" data-end="1266.029">It's still pretty powerful.</span> <span data-start="1266.029" data-end="1268.79">And that's basically it.</span> <span data-start="1268.79" data-end="1269.79">So..</span> <span data-start="1269.79" data-end="1270.79">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="1270.79" data-end="1271.79">That's how it works.</span> <span data-start="1271.79" data-end="1275.9">If you remember from our example, one of the major issues we had</span> <span data-start="1275.9" data-end="1280.19">was that the client side routing caused a lot of unexpected memory leaks.</span> <span data-start="1280.19" data-end="1285.429">Long lived processes were kind of not so great in our client side app.</span> <span data-start="1285.429" data-end="1288.92">So what we did  —  and this is something you couldn't do in Cordova, but we could, because</span> <span data-start="1288.92" data-end="1292.929">we were hacking something together  —  in order to fix the issue we had,</span> <span data-start="1292.929" data-end="1296.04">we actually moved the routing into Android, so we could take advantage of</span> <span data-start="1296.04" data-end="1300.7">the more sophisticated memory management and life cycle events, and we instantiated</span> <span data-start="1300.7" data-end="1306.659">each page of the app as an isolated view with its own activity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1306.659" data-end="1311.66">That's really similar to server side routing, and it actually has the same benefits,</span> <span data-start="1311.66" data-end="1315.25">like encapsulation of each page, but in Android, we also get the added</span> <span data-start="1315.25" data-end="1320.279">benefit of super smooth transitions, layout hierarchies, we can get</span> <span data-start="1320.279" data-end="1324.83">the back button to do what we want, so we get the best of both worlds.</span> <span data-start="1324.83" data-end="1326.75">Pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="1326.75" data-end="1329.559">What did we do about shared state?</span> <span data-start="1329.559" data-end="1332.559">This is where the JS Java bindings come in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1332.559" data-end="1336.799">Because we're using React to render the web UI, it's pretty trivial</span> <span data-start="1336.799" data-end="1341.11">to send parameters into React and take the state out of React and cache</span> <span data-start="1341.11" data-end="1343.059">in Android.</span> <span data-start="1343.059" data-end="1346.97">So what does passing rooted params look like?</span> <span data-start="1346.97" data-end="1352.34">You stringify the router params, get an initial state</span> <span data-start="1352.34" data-end="1355.5">function, and all of a sudden you have all the information from your router.</span> <span data-start="1355.5" data-end="1357.64">That's pretty simple.</span> <span data-start="1357.64" data-end="1363.539">And to cache state, we create a JavaScript interface</span> <span data-start="1363.539" data-end="1368.871">called setState, that allows us to pass in a stringified JSON object, so it</span> <span data-start="1368.871" data-end="1374.03">can be cached in the shared preferences in Android.</span> <span data-start="1374.03" data-end="1377.29">And our React code, we just need to hook into it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1377.29" data-end="1380.86">So every time our component updates, we set the</span> <span data-start="1380.86" data-end="1385.34">state in Android, so it's cached, and when the component mounts, we just pull</span> <span data-start="1385.34" data-end="1387.4">it down and then restore the state.</span> <span data-start="1387.4" data-end="1389.02">So super simple.</span> <span data-start="1389.02" data-end="1393.32">But it solves a problem  —  we can restore things in an offline context,</span> <span data-start="1393.32" data-end="1399.37">we can get around using that Android-based routing, without having to sacrifice</span> <span data-start="1399.37" data-end="1402.44">our User Experience.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1402.44" data-end="1403.97">So what about device integration?</span> <span data-start="1403.97" data-end="1405.289">This is something actually if you're going to</span> <span data-start="1405.289" data-end="1407.25">do it, you should look at the Cordova code base.</span> <span data-start="1407.25" data-end="1411.79">There's a lot of things that looked at device integration.</span> <span data-start="1411.79" data-end="1416.26">Here we write some of the typical code you would</span> <span data-start="1416.26" data-end="1420.72">write in an Android app for dispatching the camera intent, looking at whether</span> <span data-start="1420.72" data-end="1429.02">you want a camera or gallery, we create a URI out of our image, or we could do</span> <span data-start="1429.02" data-end="1432.07">something like upload it at that point in time.</span> <span data-start="1432.07" data-end="1436.48">And then we actually post it in this super awesome hacky JavaScript window</span> <span data-start="1436.48" data-end="1437.99">thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1437.99" data-end="1442.762">We actually post it to a method in JavaScript, we post the URI, and then all</span> <span data-start="1442.762" data-end="1446.14">of a sudden we can use it in our JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1446.14" data-end="1451.64">So it seems totally terrible, but hey  —  you get an understanding of how Android</span> <span data-start="1451.64" data-end="1454.36">is receiving the camera intent.</span> <span data-start="1454.36" data-end="1457.929">You get an understanding of what you can do in terms of compression.</span> <span data-start="1457.929" data-end="1460.409">You get to be a lot closer to your device than you</span> <span data-start="1460.409" data-end="1463.63">ever would be using some web API or just saying..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1463.63" data-end="1467.14">Well, we can't support camera.</span> <span data-start="1467.14" data-end="1468.21">So what else?</span> <span data-start="1468.21" data-end="1470.51">There's lots of things you can do.</span> <span data-start="1470.51" data-end="1472.83">You can bind to Android's offline network caching</span> <span data-start="1472.83" data-end="1473.83">utilities.</span> <span data-start="1473.83" data-end="1477.19">You know, if you want to do that  —  before service workers are</span> <span data-start="1477.19" data-end="1478.19">available.</span> </p>
