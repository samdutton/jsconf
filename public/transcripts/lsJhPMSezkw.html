<span data-start="321.31" data-end="324.85">absolutely I for example these factories</span> <span data-start="324.85" data-end="327.31">have millions of thousands of machines</span> <span

data-end="377.1">fundamentally important to me is that</span> <span data-start="377.1" data-end="379.81">everybody should have access to to</span> <span data-start="379.81"

still fundamentally fundamentally</span> <span data-start="393.43" data-end="395.62">interesting especially some of the</span> <span data-start="395.62" data-end="397.45">research that's going on now around</span> <span data-start="397.45" data-end="399.73">radio white space and allowing the</span> <span data-start="399.73" data-end="401.95">internet to pre pretty much anywhere</span> <span

happens is that your right is the</span> <span data-start="416.92" data-end="418.66">cell phone infrastructure completely</span> <span data-start="418.66" data-end="421.09">fails your communication

<span data-start="430.03" data-end="432.91">that so not only it will help first</span> <span data-start="432.91" data-end="435.58">responders be able to find who is in</span> <span data-start="435.58"

what's going on and indeed going</span> <span data-start="448.63" data-end="452.05">even further saving lives because as</span> <span data-start="452.05" data-end="454.18">people such as our reporters without</span> <span data-start="454.18" data-end="457.3">borders go into hostile zones what</span> <span data-start="457.3" data-end="459.94">happens well they leave behind all sorts</span> <span data-start="459.94" data-end="461.98">of interesting tracing data about</span> <span data-start="461.98" data-end="464.56">themselves why because your phone of</span> <span data-start="464.56"

public keys</span> <span data-start="1318.9" data-end="1322.08">back and forth with one another and yes</span> <span data-start="1322.08" data-end="1324.96">there are there are attack vectors that</span> <span data-start="1324.96" data-end="1327.45">maybe a one-in-a-million chance that</span> <span data-start="1327.45" data-end="1329.79">you'll get a man-in-the-middle attack</span> <span data-start="1329.79" data-end="1331.62">but for the most part we are using these</span> <span data-start="1331.62" data-end="1335.19">keys in such a way that we only</span> <span data-start="1335.19" data-end="1337.1">advertise it when we're</span> <span data-start="1337.1" data-end="1338.78">do identity exchange with someone so</span> <span data-start="1338.78" data-end="1341.63">that's a very very small window and not</span> <span data-start="1341.63" data-end="1346.28">only that but it's it's a small window</span> <span data-start="1346.28" data-end="1348.049">and chances are if there's a</span> <span data-start="1348.049" data-end="1349.91">man-in-the-middle attack it just</span> <span data-start="1349.91" data-end="1352.37">wouldn't happen at the right time it</span> <span data-start="1352.37" data-end="1353.99">would have to be very very coordinated</span> <span data-start="1353.99" data-end="1356.45">so really what we want is we want</span> <span data-start="1356.45" data-end="1358.82">something that just easily says that I</span> <span data-start="1358.82" data-end="1362.63">give this to tracy has one and I have</span> <span data-start="1362.63" data-end="1365.77">one and I said ok my number is 123456</span> <span data-start="1365.77" data-end="1368.84">she says okay yes my number is also one</span> <span data-start="1368.84" data-end="1370.669">two three four five six let's go ahead</span> <span data-start="1370.669" data-end="1375.169">and and pair these devices together so</span> <span data-start="1375.169" data-end="1379.159">that's that it is probably the least</span> <span data-start="1379.159" data-end="1381.799">painful at way we could think about</span> <span data-start="1381.799" data-end="1385.46">doing security now when we're talking</span> <span data-start="1385.46" data-end="1387.77">about doing these devices because we're</span> <span data-start="1387.77" data-end="1389.51">talking about supporting this on both</span> <span data-start="1389.51" data-end="1392.75">iOS and Android right now so basically</span> <span data-start="1392.75" data-end="1395.09">you can go out you can download Holly</span> <span data-start="1395.09" data-end="1399.71">and you can run run it today but what's</span> <span data-start="1399.71" data-end="1402.559">what's really fascinating is is the nut</span> <span data-start="1402.559" data-end="1404.87">the sheer number of Android devices and</span> <span data-start="1404.87" data-end="1407.299">the sheer number sheer number of</span> <span data-start="1407.299" data-end="1409.19">versions of that we want to make sure</span> <span data-start="1409.19" data-end="1411.59">that every time we do a delivery that</span> <span data-start="1411.59" data-end="1414.289">we're not breaking something so this is</span> <span data-start="1414.289" data-end="1417.679">actually our CI environment here which</span> <span data-start="1417.679" data-end="1421.25">is love as you can see ton of phones</span> <span data-start="1421.25" data-end="1423.65">just all hooked up to a single server</span> <span data-start="1423.65" data-end="1426.44">and every time we do a github push sure</span> <span data-start="1426.44" data-end="1428.78">enough it hits against our CI server and</span> <span data-start="1428.78" data-end="1432.049">spits out the results as a gist so we</span> <span data-start="1432.049" data-end="1437.059">live and die by this now where are we</span> <span data-start="1437.059" data-end="1441.02">going in the future well that's a that's</span> <span data-start="1441.02" data-end="1443.21">kind of a hard question because we there</span> <span data-start="1443.21" data-end="1445.429">are a lot of ideas of where we're going</span> <span data-start="1445.429" data-end="1447.32">right now we're still kind of an</span> <span data-start="1447.32" data-end="1450.59">experimental platform for building these</span> <span data-start="1450.59" data-end="1453.82">pure apps but there are very very</span> <span data-start="1453.82" data-end="1456.32">concrete things that we want to do for</span> <span data-start="1456.32" data-end="1458.75">example we will want to do mesh</span> <span data-start="1458.75" data-end="1460.7">networking so for example if I want to</span> <span data-start="1460.7" data-end="1462.35">start to send data to the back of the</span> <span data-start="1462.35" data-end="1464.78">room I might not have range to do that</span> <span data-start="1464.78" data-end="1467.24">automatically what instead I would do is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1467.24" data-end="1469.13">I would send the data at halfway around</span> <span data-start="1469.13" data-end="1470.16">the room to someone</span> <span data-start="1470.16" data-end="1472.47">Alice and then send it via another</span> <span data-start="1472.47" data-end="1475.47">couple people until it finally reaches</span> <span data-start="1475.47" data-end="1478.17">its destination in the meantime it's</span> <span data-start="1478.17" data-end="1480.87">still encrypted at rest so you might see</span> <span data-start="1480.87" data-end="1483.3">a little file on your on your device but</span> <span data-start="1483.3" data-end="1486.06">you can't actually open it and the other</span> <span data-start="1486.06" data-end="1489.12">thing is is getting around on the</span> <span data-start="1489.12" data-end="1490.56">general internet so if we're available</span> <span data-start="1490.56" data-end="1492.6">on the general internet then we can use</span> <span data-start="1492.6" data-end="1495.24">something like tour for example to</span> <span data-start="1495.24" data-end="1497.85">completely hide your traffic using tor</span> <span data-start="1497.85" data-end="1500.04">hidden services not only to hide your</span> <span data-start="1500.04" data-end="1502.5">traffic but to also get around the rules</span> <span data-start="1502.5" data-end="1506.49">that most people have on their most</span> <span data-start="1506.49" data-end="1508.11">people have on their on their local</span> <span data-start="1508.11" data-end="1510.42">routers which is to not allow local</span> <span data-start="1510.42" data-end="1512.46">traffic to go back and forth so we can</span> <span data-start="1512.46" data-end="1515.76">get around all of that that we're also</span> <span data-start="1515.76" data-end="1517.8">investigating for example radio</span> <span data-start="1517.8" data-end="1520.65">whitespace Wi-Fi and allowing that to be</span> <span data-start="1520.65" data-end="1522.99">used as well and what that is is</span> <span data-start="1522.99" data-end="1525.39">basically it's using unused channels</span> <span data-start="1525.39" data-end="1528.27">within Wi-Fi and it's able to right now</span> <span data-start="1528.27" data-end="1531.27">we're working with microsoft research to</span> <span data-start="1531.27" data-end="1535.05">to enable for example indian villages to</span> <span data-start="1535.05" data-end="1537.96">talk to one another by using by setting</span> <span data-start="1537.96" data-end="1540.81">up these Wi-Fi beacons between the two</span> <span data-start="1540.81" data-end="1543.57">just using that white space that nobody</span> <span data-start="1543.57" data-end="1548.19">else uses right now so as I said this is</span> <span data-start="1548.19" data-end="1551.61">no more than what you saw here than just</span> <span data-start="1551.61" data-end="1554.85">an NPM module so all you really have to</span> <span data-start="1554.85" data-end="1559.41">do is type mjx using JX core NPM install</span> <span data-start="1559.41" data-end="1563.25">thali and you're ready to go now you can</span> <span data-start="1563.25" data-end="1565.89">also go and visit visit our sites at</span> <span data-start="1565.89" data-end="1570.56">tully project.org but together I think</span> <span data-start="1570.56" data-end="1574.4">we can make the the pier web grade again</span> <span data-start="1574.4" data-end="1579.71">so with that thank you very much</span> </p>
