<p><span data-start="210.389" data-end="216.51">So a lot of talent is wasted, actually.</span> <span data-start="216.51" data-end="220.971">Girls and females are underrepresented in tech, if</span> <span data-start="220.971" data-end="223.709">you compare them to the male counterparts, and in the</span> <span data-start="223.709" data-end="226.09">Netherlands it is somewhat exceptional because we are</span> <span data-start="226.09" data-end="230.17">last, actually Tunisia is below us, and then the</span> <span data-start="230.17" data-end="231.17">Netherlands.</span> <span data-start="231.17" data-end="236.23">Less than 10 per cent of the females are working in IT and in the Netherlands, and</span> <span data-start="236.23" data-end="240.959">you can see Germany is below average for the 35, and we</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="244.15">have 23 per cent, and the rest of the European</span> <span data-start="244.15" data-end="247.4">Union is 37.</span> <span data-start="247.4" data-end="248.4">So why is this?</span> <span data-start="248.4" data-end="252.139">Well, the choice for science and technology by Dutch girls is far below the</span> <span data-start="252.139" data-end="253.79">average, like I said.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.79" data-end="258.109">Well, it is true that brains of boys and girls are not the same.</span> <span data-start="258.109" data-end="264.61">But these differences is not the reason why there are many more boys choosing</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="267.9">a career in tech, because both of the brains are full</span> <span data-start="267.9" data-end="270.69">with potential, but to what extent, the potential</span> <span data-start="270.69" data-end="275.27">is for fields and which is highly dependent on stimulation</span> <span data-start="275.27" data-end="277.69">that parents and teachers offer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="277.69" data-end="282.669">Next is also that girls think they perform worse</span> <span data-start="282.669" data-end="285.8">than they actually do in STEM related subjects.</span> <span data-start="285.8" data-end="288.479">I'm not sure what your grading system is, but in the</span> <span data-start="288.479" data-end="292.77">Netherlands it is from one to ten, but if you have a 5.5</span> <span data-start="292.77" data-end="295.36">then you've passed your exams.</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="300.05">We always ask students if they think they're good in mathematics, and boys normally</span> <span data-start="300.05" data-end="302.59">raise their hands if they have a six, because it's</span> <span data-start="302.59" data-end="305.09">good they passed our test, right?</span> <span data-start="305.09" data-end="308.68">And girls are more like: no, I should have eight or nine.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="308.68" data-end="312.59">So they're too hard on themselves and it is not necessary at all.</span> <span data-start="312.59" data-end="315.77">Secondly, environment, like I said, girls are less</span> <span data-start="315.77" data-end="319.33">stimulated by teachers and parents to choose a career in</span> <span data-start="319.33" data-end="322.54">IT, and this is a cartoon, I don't think you can read it</span> <span data-start="322.54" data-end="326.759">but it is a teacher, and he says: "Well, your child is</span> <span data-start="326.759" data-end="330.36">has very good grades in maths and science, but she's</span> <span data-start="330.36" data-end="331.36">a girl."</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="331.36" data-end="335.199">And then the parents reply "Oh shit, that's too bad."</span> <span data-start="335.199" data-end="339.13">So that's not an option to consider a career in IT.</span> <span data-start="339.13" data-end="341.98">Last but not least, there's unfamiliarity.</span> <span data-start="341.98" data-end="345.74">Girls have no good image of STEM medications and professions</span> <span data-start="345.74" data-end="349.47">and there's a huge lack of role models.</span> <span data-start="349.47" data-end="353.699">So I just want to conclude this with a quote, it is from unlocking</span> <span data-start="353.699" data-end="357.11">in the clubhouse, very early in life computing is</span> <span data-start="357.11" data-end="360.49">claimed as male territory at each sustainable early childhood</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="363.77">through college, computing is both claimed as guy stuff</span> <span data-start="363.77" data-end="368.21">by boys and men and passively ceded by girls and women.</span> <span data-start="368.21" data-end="370.34">Question observation shows that disinterest and</span> <span data-start="370.34" data-end="373.259">dissatisfaction are neither genetic nor accidental, nor</span> <span data-start="373.259" data-end="377.75">inherent to the field, but are the bitter fruit of</span> <span data-start="377.75" data-end="379.99">external influences.</span> <span data-start="379.99" data-end="382.49">This is important because if you think there are</span> <span data-start="382.49" data-end="385.72">less girls in IT because of disinterest, then you're</span> <span data-start="385.72" data-end="388.439">wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="388.439" data-end="392.139">One of the external interests is unconscious bias.</span> <span data-start="392.139" data-end="396.389">Evolution has taught us to mathematically process</span> <span data-start="396.389" data-end="399.22">information without critical thinking, so we're</span> <span data-start="399.22" data-end="401.99">constantly overlooking much of the world around us and</span> <span data-start="401.99" data-end="404.22">there's actually nothing serious about this.</span> <span data-start="404.22" data-end="407.969">We receive 11 million bits of information every day,</span> <span data-start="407.969" data-end="412.139">and we can only consciously process 40 bits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="412.139" data-end="415.79">The conclusion is stuff gets broken while our brain is storing</span> <span data-start="415.79" data-end="419.18">information, and our objectives are certainly clouded</span> <span data-start="419.18" data-end="422.129">because our brain is taking shortcuts and relies on our</span> <span data-start="422.129" data-end="424.349">earlier assumptions.</span> <span data-start="424.349" data-end="429.3">So even a tiny bit of bias can have big consequences, for example, these</span> <span data-start="429.3" data-end="434.24">biases can prevent introduction of diversity into workplaces.</span> <span data-start="434.24" data-end="436.24">I think this is a great example.</span> <span data-start="436.24" data-end="438.199">Blind auditions.</span> <span data-start="438.199" data-end="441.05">I just add another picture of a cat behind the curtain,</span> <span data-start="441.05" data-end="444.55">because that's the way it is supposed to be.</span> <span data-start="444.55" data-end="445.55">Laughter].</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.55" data-end="449.7">Well, it is a research from Princeton, and they</span> <span data-start="449.7" data-end="452.759">found other that since the 1970s the number of women in</span> <span data-start="452.759" data-end="457.419">orchestras went up from five to 25 per cent, and due to</span> <span data-start="457.419" data-end="460.509">the fact that they asked them to audition behind the</span> <span data-start="460.509" data-end="463.789">screen or curtain so they couldn't see if it was a male</span> <span data-start="463.789" data-end="465.06">or female.</span> <span data-start="465.06" data-end="470.819">So I think that is  —  well, that's a lot of bias going on right there.</span> <span data-start="470.819" data-end="473.77">Well, most people would agree that gender bias</span> <span data-start="473.77" data-end="476.349">exists in others.</span> <span data-start="476.349" data-end="478.8">All of us, myself included, are biased.</span> <span data-start="478.8" data-end="482.499">So you should take a look around, I think you</span> <span data-start="482.499" data-end="484.33">know the cartoon, maybe.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="747.6" data-end="755.89">I think it is a bit like a German word, if I pronounce it right.</span> <span data-start="755.89" data-end="757.34">Gizelle(?).</span> <span data-start="757.34" data-end="758.8">Okay.</span> <span data-start="758.8" data-end="760.25">Well.</span> <span data-start="760.25" data-end="766.32">Anyway, I think this gender bias could be a major threat, and it is a major threat,</span> <span data-start="766.32" data-end="769.33">because it is one of the key reasons why few girls study</span> <span data-start="769.33" data-end="770.98">computer science.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="770.98" data-end="773.89">The good news is bias can be weakened.</span> <span data-start="773.89" data-end="775.98">The bad news is you cannot do it alone.</span> <span data-start="775.98" data-end="778.3">We should all do it together.</span> <span data-start="778.3" data-end="781.05">So, what should we do first?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="781.05" data-end="785.44">Well, be aware that you're bias, because believe me, you are.</span> <span data-start="785.44" data-end="789.62">Just take the test when you have time, and you learn about</span> <span data-start="789.62" data-end="792.35">your biases and how you can address them.</span> <span data-start="792.35" data-end="796.05">Second, I think it is important, use inclusive language.</span> <span data-start="796.05" data-end="800.57">Because a couple weeks ago I was at a conference, a Dutch conference, and it was</span> <span data-start="800.57" data-end="805.16">about the future programmer, and someone got to the</span> <span data-start="805.16" data-end="807.94">stage and started talking about the future programmer</span> <span data-start="807.94" data-end="812.93">and he said: well, he is this and he is that, and he should</span> <span data-start="812.93" data-end="814.91">be this and he should be like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="814.91" data-end="816.72">And I felt offended, come on.</span> <span data-start="816.72" data-end="820.51">I am obviously not a future programmer then.</span> <span data-start="820.51" data-end="824.011">So I don't think he meant it that way, but it</span> <span data-start="824.011" data-end="827.81">is good to be aware of what you're saying.</span> <span data-start="827.81" data-end="831.97">I think this is from a social media platform and they removed the</span> <span data-start="831.97" data-end="835.31">word hacker" from their job titles, and they noticed</span> <span data-start="835.31" data-end="837.35">the change in who was applying.</span> <span data-start="837.35" data-end="841.07">So they decided to write an article about it and how gender inclusive</span> <span data-start="841.07" data-end="846.22">they were, they attached an e-mail they sent to the employees,</span> <span data-start="846.22" data-end="849.2">and the e-mail started with "Hi guys".</span> <span data-start="849.2" data-end="852.06">It is not very gender inclusive.</span> <span data-start="852.06" data-end="857.81">So just for some people this is offending, so just be aware of what you're</span> <span data-start="857.81" data-end="859.18">saying.</span> <span data-start="859.18" data-end="862.35">Well, this is important.</span> <span data-start="862.35" data-end="865.92">If you're male or female, doesn't matter, hold yourself and others accountable</span> <span data-start="865.92" data-end="869.43">and point it out, because by the simple act of</span> <span data-start="869.43" data-end="872.51">talking openly about behavioural patterns it makes</span> <span data-start="872.51" data-end="876.04">the subconscious conscious, so talking transforms</span> <span data-start="876.04" data-end="878.49">minds which transforms behaviour and communities,</span> <span data-start="878.49" data-end="883.37">and which can result in a better environment, for example,</span> <span data-start="883.37" data-end="884.37">women in tech.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="884.37" data-end="889.53">So we should all share this and talk about it.</span> <span data-start="889.53" data-end="894.82">Last but not least, use your imagination.</span> <span data-start="894.82" data-end="896.73">Counter-program your brain.</span> <span data-start="896.73" data-end="900.68">I Googled for "programmer" and these were the results I got.</span> <span data-start="900.68" data-end="905.04">I really like the right one, below it says, "Do not wake up</span> <span data-start="905.04" data-end="907.44">a programmer, he is working, not sleeping."</span> <span data-start="907.44" data-end="910.65">It is important, important lesson.</span> <span data-start="910.65" data-end="915.32">But you can only see one female and there is a black guy and the rest of them</span> <span data-start="915.32" data-end="916.88">are all white males.</span> <span data-start="916.88" data-end="920.77">And I think you should be aware of the images you have in your head.</span> <span data-start="920.77" data-end="925.45">If I ask you to picture an architect or programmer, I think most of the</span> <span data-start="925.45" data-end="928.49">time it will be a white male with glasses or something</span> <span data-start="928.49" data-end="929.49">like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="929.49" data-end="933.05">Just be aware this is not always true .. I think</span> <span data-start="933.05" data-end="935.65">you probably all know this one.</span> <span data-start="935.65" data-end="938.13">Hashtag I look like an engineer.</span> <span data-start="938.13" data-end="942.71">I think this a great way of bias busting.</span> <span data-start="942.71" data-end="948.5">It started with this girl, she works at 1 lodge</span> <span data-start="948.5" data-end="953.11">Inn, and I don't know if I'm supposed to say that, but</span> <span data-start="953.11" data-end="957.701">she was an advertising campaign for a company, and they</span> <span data-start="957.701" data-end="960.5">were looking for developers, and then she got a</span> <span data-start="960.5" data-end="963.35">lot of responses on her picture like "oh, I didn't</span> <span data-start="963.35" data-end="964.76">know that you were an engineer.</span> <span data-start="964.76" data-end="967.71">You don't look like an engineer" and so on.</span> <span data-start="967.71" data-end="973.74">And she was a bit fed up and started the hashtag actually, and she asked everyone to</span> <span data-start="973.74" data-end="974.85">spread the word.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="974.85" data-end="978.62">And I think these are all engineers, you should remember.</span> <span data-start="978.62" data-end="985.24">This is some great bias busting, like I said, and it is a great way of breaking down gender</span> <span data-start="985.24" data-end="987.23">stereotypes.</span> <span data-start="987.23" data-end="993.48">So in short, be aware that you're bias.</span> <span data-start="993.48" data-end="995.24">Use inclusive language.</span> <span data-start="995.24" data-end="998.94">Hold yourself and others accountable and use your imagination.</span> <span data-start="998.94" data-end="1001.35">So counter programme your brain.</span> <span data-start="1001.35" data-end="1006.77">I know we are at JSconf and it should be about coding and programming, but</span> <span data-start="1006.77" data-end="1009.67">the thing is it is not about the programming, it is about</span> <span data-start="1009.67" data-end="1012.75">the way you're programmed.</span> <span data-start="1012.75" data-end="1016.76">I know it has been a challenging day today, but I'd like to ask you to take this</span> <span data-start="1016.76" data-end="1021.201">home and to look past your initial perceptions, because</span> <span data-start="1021.201" data-end="1023.57">I bet you they're probably wrong.</span> <span data-start="1023.57" data-end="1024.57">So thank you.</span> </p>
