<p><span data-start="29.92" data-end="30.92">Thank you.</span> <span data-start="30.92" data-end="31.92">Hello.</span> <span data-start="31.92" data-end="32.92">So yes.</span> <span data-start="32.92" data-end="34.34">My name is Jessica Tran.</span> <span data-start="34.34" data-end="36.13">I am from Montreal.</span> <span data-start="36.13" data-end="40.69">I'm currently a student studying computer science and physics.</span> <span data-start="40.69" data-end="47.89">And today I'm going to talk to you about my anxiety and selfmonitoring through technology.</span> <span data-start="47.89" data-end="53.15">So I want to preface this by saying that me and my anxiety are not friends.</span> <span data-start="53.15" data-end="55.059">In the very least.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="55.059" data-end="62.32">To get a sense of our relationship, imagine you have an ex, and you guys are on good terms.</span> <span data-start="62.32" data-end="67.81">But you share a lot of the same friends and end up at a lot of the social gatherings.</span> <span data-start="67.81" data-end="72.53">You want to avoid them, but to have fun, you can't.</span> <span data-start="72.53" data-end="76.33">That's a metaphor if I anxiety.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="76.33" data-end="86.06">My palms get sweaty, my heart races and my brain shuts down all processes.</span> <span data-start="86.06" data-end="88.18">And in fact, this is not special at all.</span> <span data-start="88.18" data-end="93.42">It's a universal symptom if you have a healthy brain and body.</span> <span data-start="93.42" data-end="98.49">So to get a longitudinal sense of how long I have been dealing with anxiety.</span> <span data-start="98.49" data-end="101.4">Let's address my biggest childhood fear.</span> <span data-start="101.4" data-end="105.61">This is a big therapy talk for all of us.</span> <span data-start="105.61" data-end="110.38">One of my biggest fears was that I might forget how to breathe.</span> <span data-start="110.38" data-end="112.12">And this sounds really, really dumb.</span> <span data-start="112.12" data-end="119.59">But I was like 5 or 7 or 9 or some odd number and I would spend hours concentrating really</span> <span data-start="119.59" data-end="125.61">hard on my breathing just in case the little guy in my head would forget to pull the lever.</span> <span data-start="125.61" data-end="129.179">You all thought about this guy when you were young.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.179" data-end="135.06">But, of course, I eventual learned and breathing is an automatic physiological function.</span> <span data-start="135.06" data-end="136.209">I hope all of you have.</span> <span data-start="136.209" data-end="141.17">It lies in the same domain as blinking, hunger, exhaustion.</span> <span data-start="141.17" data-end="146.09">It's just a way that our body automatically regulates so that cognitive resources can</span> <span data-start="146.09" data-end="150.569">be spent towards higher thinking, problem solving.</span> <span data-start="150.569" data-end="159.03">Nonetheless, even at my ripe old age of 23, I still worry about my breath and overintellectualize</span> <span data-start="159.03" data-end="160.06">it.</span> <span data-start="160.06" data-end="162.73">To the point it becomes really irregular.</span> <span data-start="162.73" data-end="164.48">And that's, again, very natural.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.48" data-end="172.02">If I were to ask you right now it pay attention to your breath, you would also probably get</span> <span data-start="172.02" data-end="174.069">into an a-rhythm.</span> <span data-start="174.069" data-end="175.569">So we can try it out.</span> <span data-start="175.569" data-end="177.629">Please pay attention to your breath.</span> <span data-start="177.629" data-end="179.069">Are you inhaling?</span> <span data-start="179.069" data-end="181.54">What about exhaling?</span> <span data-start="181.54" data-end="186.459">Are you on tempo?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="186.459" data-end="187.84">Did you remember to inhale?</span> <span data-start="187.84" data-end="188.84">Okay.</span> <span data-start="188.84" data-end="193.48">So that was a dumb exercise, but now imagine me doing that to you constantly all the time</span> <span data-start="193.48" data-end="194.48">at any moment.</span> <span data-start="194.48" data-end="196.489">That's what my anxiety is like.</span> <span data-start="196.489" data-end="197.599">And this is my life.</span> <span data-start="197.599" data-end="202.41">But I really, really love to problem solve.</span> <span data-start="202.41" data-end="203.97">Which is one of my greatest strengths.</span> <span data-start="203.97" data-end="209.58">And I tried to address this problem in the best way I know how, which is through a mix</span> <span data-start="209.58" data-end="214.489">of psychology, philosophy, and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="214.489" data-end="217.68">So starting with psychology.</span> <span data-start="217.68" data-end="221.32">There's some studies that show a correlation between breath and mood.</span> <span data-start="221.32" data-end="227.53">Basically, when you're in a heightened state like fear or anxiety, your breath rate is</span> <span data-start="227.53" data-end="229.909">going to quicken.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="229.909" data-end="235.31">And studies have shown in more recent years that this is a bidirectional mechanism.</span> <span data-start="235.31" data-end="239.29">Meaning while a mood can change your rate of breath, your rate of breath can also change</span> <span data-start="239.29" data-end="240.31">your mood.</span> <span data-start="240.31" data-end="242.28">Which is really, really cool.</span> <span data-start="242.28" data-end="244.95">But we'll get more into that a bit later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="244.95" data-end="251.409">So qualitatively, I wanted to parse out the distinctions of my mood.</span> <span data-start="251.409" data-end="257.079">So I just wrote out things that when I'm anxious and when I'm happy.</span> <span data-start="257.079" data-end="263.659">And about last year� late last year, my anxiety was getting really difficult to manage.</span> <span data-start="263.659" data-end="271.439">I had moved to a new city, I wasn't fitting in, the bills were surmounting, a few strands</span> <span data-start="271.439" data-end="274.029">of stress I can deal with like most people.</span> <span data-start="274.029" data-end="279.999">But eventual it compounded and got in the way of simple functions like eating, sleeping,</span> <span data-start="279.999" data-end="283.129">being able to leave my house, and ultimately being productive.</span> <span data-start="283.129" data-end="291.279">And it blocked all these things� these small things that made me happy and led you to depression.</span> <span data-start="291.279" data-end="293.619">Which is what I like to call the anxiety/depression cycle.</span> <span data-start="293.619" data-end="299.219">Can't do things you ought to be doing, and you feel sad.</span> <span data-start="299.219" data-end="304.93">And to address it real quick, this is one of the hardest parts about dealing with mental</span> <span data-start="304.93" data-end="306.039">health.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.039" data-end="311.089">And one of the factors I really tried to address in this experiment.</span> <span data-start="311.089" data-end="315.03">Secondly, I don't want to simplify mental health.</span> <span data-start="315.03" data-end="321.61">I recognize there are a ton of intersectional, biological, environmental and sociologic forces</span> <span data-start="321.61" data-end="325.499">that harm and continue it harm people.</span> <span data-start="325.499" data-end="331.249">I myself am affected by factors, nonetheless, I carved out this particular aspect because</span> <span data-start="331.249" data-end="335.289">it was the easiest to delineate and target.</span> <span data-start="335.289" data-end="342.619">Because I'm a� back together, I figured this was the right way to start.</span> <span data-start="342.619" data-end="351.659">And my next step was to figure out the mechanism behind this and what it means to be productive.</span> <span data-start="351.659" data-end="352.74">So that bring us to the panopticon.</span> <span data-start="352.74" data-end="359.729">If you don't or do know what it is, and haven't read �Discipline and Punishment� by Michel</span> <span data-start="359.729" data-end="363.399">Foucault, you probably have the idea wrong.</span> <span data-start="363.399" data-end="372.189">Which I only point out not to be a dick, but before I had it pointed out that it was not</span> <span data-start="372.189" data-end="373.46">correct.</span> <span data-start="373.46" data-end="374.83">Unlike the way that I'm doing now.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="374.83" data-end="381.649">So there's a common misconception with the panopticon presented through mainstream media</span> <span data-start="381.649" data-end="384.949">that makes it an analogy towards surveillance society.</span> <span data-start="384.949" data-end="393.3">You have seen the sensational articles, the government is watching you, this is the panopticon.</span> <span data-start="393.3" data-end="398.889">And one of the great analogies is Sauron from the Lord of the Rings.</span> <span data-start="398.889" data-end="409.139">They match with the originally, but it's a quality in which humans attribute characteristics</span> <span data-start="409.139" data-end="421.249">such as villainy, evilness� which I want to very much frame right now that that is</span> <span data-start="421.249" data-end="422.249">not the case.</span> <span data-start="422.249" data-end="428.779">And for Foucault himself in the very beginning of his novel writes that we should not view</span> <span data-start="428.779" data-end="432.599">power and surveillance as a negative thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="432.599" data-end="441.52">It was first introduced as a humane way to have social order as opposed to torture and</span> <span data-start="441.52" data-end="442.58">violence.</span> <span data-start="442.58" data-end="451.289">While now it is arguably invisible and silence, if we should view it as a mutual and malleable</span> <span data-start="451.289" data-end="456.249">mechanism, we can use it for our own positive production of reality.</span> <span data-start="456.249" data-end="460.689">So here's my very quick crash course on panopticonism.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="460.689" data-end="466.539">It's named after Jeremy Bentham's ideal prison.</span> <span data-start="466.539" data-end="471.53">It's a cylindrical structure, a prison.</span> <span data-start="471.53" data-end="476.129">And around the cells we have openfaced cells.</span> <span data-start="476.129" data-end="478.649">And in the very center we have a guard.</span> <span data-start="478.649" data-end="481.55">Just one single guard in this tower.</span> <span data-start="481.55" data-end="487.239">It's protected by trick glass so the guard can see out, but the prisoners cannot see</span> <span data-start="487.239" data-end="488.239">in.</span> <span data-start="488.239" data-end="493.509">And this mechanism, this is the most ideal and efficient use of this power.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.509" data-end="499.059">Because this possibility of always being watched will imbue the prisoner with an anxiousness</span> <span data-start="499.059" data-end="501.479">to behave well.</span> <span data-start="501.479" data-end="509.159">Which should, by the power of the panopticon, lead to the development of our own selfmonitoring</span> <span data-start="509.159" data-end="512.55">for good behavior.</span> <span data-start="512.55" data-end="514.37">The panopticon is polyvalent.</span> <span data-start="514.37" data-end="518.81">Means that the guard could be changed for anybody.</span> <span data-start="518.81" data-end="523.899">Your school teacher, your parents, your sibling, your friend, that guy on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="523.899" data-end="524.98">Anyone.</span> <span data-start="524.98" data-end="528.69">And it would still function without interruption.</span> <span data-start="528.69" data-end="534.36">Each node in this network can be swapped out and replaced at any given time, which is what</span> <span data-start="534.36" data-end="538.09">makes it so pervasive and powerful.</span> <span data-start="538.09" data-end="543.69">With the perception that everyone or anyone could be watching you, you must fulfill your</span> <span data-start="543.69" data-end="544.899">social contract.</span> <span data-start="544.899" data-end="550.779">And the panopticon rests on this power of observation to form good habits.</span> <span data-start="550.779" data-end="560.769">So by definition, Foucault's panopticon is just a way to enforce a specific behavior.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="560.769" data-end="562.529">It can take many forms.</span> <span data-start="562.529" data-end="569.55">So, for example, school welcomes hospitals, prisons, the new language, ten ways to make</span> <span data-start="569.55" data-end="573.449">yourself more productive, social networks, et cetera.</span> <span data-start="573.449" data-end="576.759">It sounds a little scary, but it's not.</span> <span data-start="576.759" data-end="581.639">It's actually meant to condition onesself for selfdiscipline.</span> <span data-start="581.639" data-end="590.089">So using this and combining it with Pavlov's dog, which I'm sure all of you know the classical</span> <span data-start="590.089" data-end="592.22">conditioning mechanism.</span> <span data-start="592.22" data-end="596.41">It's just the saliva and the trigger and the response.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="596.41" data-end="602.24">You have a really good recipe to improve one's life.</span> <span data-start="602.24" data-end="613.25">And combining this with� with heart rate variability, it's a very nice slide� I created</span> <span data-start="613.25" data-end="614.98">an app.</span> <span data-start="614.98" data-end="616.1">Anyways.</span> <span data-start="616.1" data-end="619.35">So the panopticon itself is just an amplifier for things that already exist.</span> <span data-start="619.35" data-end="620.35">It's not scary.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.35" data-end="629.11">It's not so much like Sauron, but Cerebro from XMen.</span> <span data-start="629.11" data-end="630.88">It can be exploitative, but also used for good.</span> <span data-start="630.88" data-end="632.56">Which is what we're going to do.</span> <span data-start="632.56" data-end="634.329">Getting into the technical stuff.</span> <span data-start="634.329" data-end="635.98">Heart rate variability.</span> <span data-start="635.98" data-end="643.45">When you inhale, your heart rate increases, and while you exhale, your heart rate decreases.</span> <span data-start="643.45" data-end="647.47">And if you plot this on a time function you get a really nice line.</span> <span data-start="647.47" data-end="649.62">And it's very distinct.</span> <span data-start="649.62" data-end="656.36">And just an FYI, the Y axis is your interbeat interval, the time in between each beat.</span> <span data-start="656.36" data-end="661.8">This is not to be mistaken for BPM which is beats per minute.</span> <span data-start="661.8" data-end="666.149">And it's just an approximation.</span> <span data-start="666.149" data-end="672.49">So one of the reasons why I got started with this project was, A, my anxiety got pretty</span> <span data-start="672.49" data-end="673.49">bad.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="673.49" data-end="679.66">B, I was actually doing an internship through Node with Outreachy, and we were working on</span> <span data-start="679.66" data-end="681.18">Node's serial port.</span> <span data-start="681.18" data-end="689.6">So I wanted to do a fun little project to figure out how this code base worked at all.</span> <span data-start="689.6" data-end="692.38">And I settled on something that was beneficial for me.</span> <span data-start="692.38" data-end="698.899">I wanted to do a live demo, but my pulse sensor didn't work really well, so in short what</span> <span data-start="698.899" data-end="705.339">I did was I just used Node serial port, a bunch of npm node packages and I designed</span> <span data-start="705.339" data-end="711.56">this little heart rate monitor on my CLI.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="711.56" data-end="713.87">And read in my heart rate.</span> <span data-start="713.87" data-end="722.439">So I'm sorry if you can't see that line really well, but this is me breathing at a resting</span> <span data-start="722.439" data-end="723.439">heart rate.</span> <span data-start="723.439" data-end="726.819">So this is� this is me not doing anything at all.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="726.819" data-end="731.73">And you can kind of see, naturally, as we know, as you breathe in and exhale, your heart</span> <span data-start="731.73" data-end="734.68">rate goes up and down, plot that, it goes up and down.</span> <span data-start="734.68" data-end="736.249">It's not really predictable.</span> <span data-start="736.249" data-end="741.449">And there's no way to really put this into an equation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="741.449" data-end="747.149">However, if you breathe really deeply and regularly, you can increase� you can create</span> <span data-start="747.149" data-end="751.699">these really beautiful sinusoidal wave lines.</span> <span data-start="751.699" data-end="757.579">And this increase in amplitude and the consistency of the graph is sort of the heart of this</span> <span data-start="757.579" data-end="758.66">project.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="758.66" data-end="760.79">And this is called heart rate variability.</span> <span data-start="760.79" data-end="766.56">You can see the heart rate is higher than before.</span> <span data-start="766.56" data-end="772.509">The greater the heart rate variability, the greater the physical health, and leads to</span> <span data-start="772.509" data-end="781.839">psychological well-being, stress management, anxiety management, cardiac health.</span> <span data-start="781.839" data-end="791.11">So this is just a video of me� whoops� doing some breathing exercises.</span> <span data-start="791.11" data-end="793.17">As you can see here, with a metronome.</span> <span data-start="793.17" data-end="804.17">This is six cycles per minute which is what is called a resonance frequency.</span> <span data-start="804.17" data-end="810.529">Resonance frequency is basically just the most efficient rate that you can breathe to</span> <span data-start="810.529" data-end="813.069">really flex your breathing systems.</span> <span data-start="813.069" data-end="816.529">Also known as your autonomic nervous system.</span> <span data-start="816.529" data-end="817.74">This is a simple graph.</span> <span data-start="817.74" data-end="825.019">You can determine your resonance frequency by going through different cycles.</span> <span data-start="825.019" data-end="830.12">You can breathe at 4 cycles a minute, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6.</span> <span data-start="830.12" data-end="833.8">And you can see on the plot line, 6 is the highest.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="862.72" data-end="865.379">So what can we do with this?</span> <span data-start="865.379" data-end="874.18">We can basically just exercise our breathing mechanism to really flex our A and S or automatic</span> <span data-start="874.18" data-end="876.75">nervous system.</span> <span data-start="876.75" data-end="881.759">If you do this� this has been done multiple times through a lot of different studies through</span> <span data-start="881.759" data-end="884.8">different groups.</span> <span data-start="884.8" data-end="888.93">Healthy functioning athletes to depressed individual.</span> <span data-start="888.93" data-end="895.709">Do this resonance frequency breathing 20 minutes a day, maybe 40 minutes a day with some intermittent</span> <span data-start="895.709" data-end="900.819">biofeedback training and it can improve your mood regulation, your anxiety, et cetera,</span> <span data-start="900.819" data-end="901.819">et cetera.</span> <span data-start="901.819" data-end="902.879">Very, very cool.</span> <span data-start="902.879" data-end="908">But one of the biggest and most important factors, I find, is that through this training,</span> <span data-start="908" data-end="910.1">the effects are chronic.</span> <span data-start="910.1" data-end="911.24">And persistent.</span> <span data-start="911.24" data-end="913.41">So say you do this for a few weeks.</span> </p>
