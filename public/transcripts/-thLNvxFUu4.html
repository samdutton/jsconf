<p><span data-start="1.64" data-end="27.079"Audience member: Lena Reinhard I'm specializing in marketing, community care and project management in tech.</span> <span data-start="27.079" data-end="33.261">I'm committed to the Open Source project hoodie and apatch key couch DB and co‑founder at</span> <span data-start="33.261" data-end="40.94">the neighborhoodie a software consulting company. What you can see behind me is a acre in southern</span> <span data-start="40.94" data-end="47.699">Germany close to village where I grew up. And this is where this talk begins, this achier</span> <span data-start="47.699" data-end="55.23">in southern Germany this land is cultivated land, this is culture. The leg rich term culture</span> <span data-start="55.23" data-end="61.539">evolved in the mid‑15th century and meant the tilling of land, it's about who cared</span> <span data-start="61.539" data-end="67.229">for which parts of land, who did the work on it, and who brought in the harvest. There's</span> <span data-start="67.229" data-end="71.89">also a figtive sense of culture which leads us to the main case and which we refer to</span> <span data-start="71.89" data-end="80.71">today. Our modern term culture is the expression of the way we act and refers to community</span> <span data-start="80.71" data-end="87.799">or group which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.799" data-end="93.05">I work in the tech world, and I contribute to Open Source. And I love what I do, because</span> <span data-start="93.05" data-end="98.93">I found amazing people there and great projects which have become near and dear to me. Still,</span> <span data-start="98.93" data-end="104.07">the future of Open Source is in danger, this is why, in this talk, I want us to take a</span> <span data-start="104.07" data-end="109.5">look at culture in the world of free, liberal and Open Source software today, and to make</span> <span data-start="109.5" data-end="114.56">it a bit easier for both you and me, I'll just refer oit as Open Source from now on.</span> <span data-start="114.56" data-end="118.89">Even if you're not contributing to Open Source projects yourself, most of these topics are</span> <span data-start="118.89" data-end="126.119">applicable to general tech culture and human interaction in general, today.</span> <span data-start="126.119" data-end="132.34">Technologywise Open Source is highly relevant, mobile, social media, Cloud services and big</span> <span data-start="132.34" data-end="137.98">data, for very important technologies of our time rely heavily on Open Source. Open Source</span> <span data-start="137.98" data-end="144.93">is also relevant for business, it contributes 450\hbillion Euros per year, only to the European</span> <span data-start="144.93" data-end="153.87">economy. So, things are going great in Open Source, right. Let me show you one thing first.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="153.87" data-end="163.04">The amazing people from geek feminism Wikk ‑‑ technologye Open Source software, gaming</span> <span data-start="163.04" data-end="169.909">and more. This is the number of sexist incidents per year, starting in the year 2000. Today,</span> <span data-start="169.909" data-end="178.651">on September\h14, 2014, the number of sexist incidents, only this year is 52. Although</span> <span data-start="178.651" data-end="183.739">this graphic does not only display incidents in Open Source software it depicts one thing</span> <span data-start="183.739" data-end="189.799">clearly, a lot of things are going terribly wrong in our communities and their culture.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="189.799" data-end="195.95">And here's why. Often when you talk about Open Source projects people quickly refer</span> <span data-start="195.95" data-end="203.59">to the community, and are very excited about it. Let's take a closer look at communities.</span> <span data-start="203.59" data-end="210.01">Dianeal Harrelson an an authorpologyist did research on the Fedora project, 75\hpercent</span> <span data-start="210.01" data-end="218.439">of the respondents to her questions felt that the Fedorra project is a community. The community</span> <span data-start="218.439" data-end="227.7">is the project, and, without the community, we're lost. But when we're talking about the</span> <span data-start="227.7" data-end="231.56">community, and even if we're appreciating it, there's one essential point that we must</span> <span data-start="231.56" data-end="233.02">not miss.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="233.02" data-end="241.29">As Joseph Raz phrased it, if a culture is decaying or if it's discripple fated against,</span> <span data-start="241.29" data-end="247.599">the options and opportunities open to it's members will shrink. Community is not just</span> <span data-start="247.599" data-end="252.36">about building nice stuff and hanging around with nice people and chat rooms mailing lists</span> <span data-start="252.36" data-end="258.79">or conferences like this one today. Every troll, every sexist comment, every harassment</span> <span data-start="258.79" data-end="266.19">toward one single community member will directly harm this person, the entire community, the</span> <span data-start="266.19" data-end="270.67">product that you're building, and finally Open Source in general. It's values, it's</span> <span data-start="270.67" data-end="280.9">ideas,e and it's existence. One major deterministic of culture is language. Mars climate or by</span> <span data-start="280.9" data-end="292.17">tore was launched by NASA in 1998 to study the atmospheric changes on mars. It got lost</span> <span data-start="292.17" data-end="296.39">in space, it dissinty grated due to atmospheric stresses.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.39" data-end="303.23">What was the reason for this robot's death. It was caused by human communication failure,</span> <span data-start="303.23" data-end="309.61">four pieces of software producing and expecting data in different units to navigators in the</span> <span data-start="309.61" data-end="315.6">teams involved pointed out the issues but the concerns had been dismissed what happened</span> <span data-start="315.6" data-end="325.1">to mars climate orbiter is described by Conway's Law, a computer programmer,. Conway's Law</span> <span data-start="325.1" data-end="331.21">states that organizations which design systems produce designs which are copies of their</span> <span data-start="331.21" data-end="338.68">communication structures. Open Source carries Conway's Law to extremes, as a scientist phrased</span> <span data-start="338.68" data-end="344.66">it. In Open Source there's a hybridism of dialogue and code where the dialogue is directly</span> <span data-start="344.66" data-end="351.79">embedded in the code. They called Open Source a network of people and things that is constructed</span> <span data-start="351.79" data-end="358.24">through the materiallization of language. In other words, all communications in an Open</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.24" data-end="363.09">Source project will have direct impact on the product, like the software that you're</span> <span data-start="363.09" data-end="368.53">building. All communications, no matter if there are any, if there are none, if they're</span> <span data-start="368.53" data-end="376.261">peaceful or violent. I want to show you part of the endangered languages project. Every</span> <span data-start="376.261" data-end="387.95">dot represents over 3,000 languages that are currently becoming extinct. If a few of the</span> <span data-start="387.95" data-end="393.12">languages disappear large parts of the world's population could still talk, so why should</span> <span data-start="393.12" data-end="399.71">we care if languages are lost? Let me ask you two things first, who of you has ever</span> <span data-start="399.71" data-end="406.94">contributed to a free liberal or Open Source project? Oh, that's plenty. And who of you</span> <span data-start="406.94" data-end="411.27">is a programmer or has ever done anything related programming like editing a bit of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="411.27" data-end="421.17">HTML or CSS? Okay. Huge overlaps, I see that. As people who can deal with programming languages,</span> <span data-start="421.17" data-end="427.41">you know that one of the core functionalities is that language shapes reality. One change</span> <span data-start="427.41" data-end="432.7">in an expression in the source code of an application can affect everything. And, break</span> <span data-start="432.7" data-end="436.419">everything, I guess so much of you have heard of that.</span> <span data-start="436.419" data-end="441.47">Language is an essential part of our culture and it shapes the way we express ourselves,</span> <span data-start="441.47" data-end="447.73">and this is why when one language disappears into oblivion we are all diminished. Thus,</span> <span data-start="447.73" data-end="452.76">silencing people and their voices and Open Source destables and endangers each and every</span> <span data-start="452.76" data-end="457.86">one of us. We in each source have to stop silencing people when they speak out about</span> <span data-start="457.86" data-end="465.44">threats, mobbing, sexism and other topics that show our broken culture. Open Source</span> <span data-start="465.44" data-end="471.65">is the materialtion of language and our community culture influence every one of us. This is</span> <span data-start="471.65" data-end="475.961">why we have to take even more care of the culture in Open Source communities. Because</span> <span data-start="475.961" data-end="482.22">the future of Open Source will be mainly determined its culture. \h‑‑ by its culture. Let's</span> <span data-start="482.22" data-end="487.13">see what other aspects we have to care for in our communities and have a short excursion</span> <span data-start="487.13" data-end="495.41">to biology. As Charles Elton, an ecologist argued simple, non‑diverse communities are</span> <span data-start="495.41" data-end="502">more easily upset than richer ones, that is they're more vulnerable. And biology there's</span> <span data-start="502" data-end="507.58">a special research field for this topic, and part of it is the so‑called stability diversity</span> <span data-start="507.58" data-end="513.72">hypothesis. In short, this hypothesis states that the more diverse a community is, the</span> <span data-start="513.72" data-end="520.19">more stable and productive it is. Great example for space, which is diverse by default are</span> <span data-start="520.19" data-end="528.34">rain forests. Typically, they posess a great deal of species diversity. Around 40‑75\hpercent</span> <span data-start="528.34" data-end="533.15">of all biotic species are native to the rain forests.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="533.15" data-end="540.11">Same goes with Coral reefs, they occupy less than 0.1\hpercent of the world's ocean service,</span> <span data-start="540.11" data-end="549.32">that is around the size of France, yet they provide a home for 25 of all marine species.</span> <span data-start="549.32" data-end="554.51">Diversity means variety and dissimilarity. It is a state and process of involving people</span> <span data-start="554.51" data-end="561.66">who are different from each other in to a group and aims to create an inclusive culture.</span> <span data-start="561.66" data-end="566.81">Diversity in natural setting, usually nothing we have to impresent or fix, diversity is</span> <span data-start="566.81" data-end="572.78">the default. In artificial settings like Open Source communities are, we have to cake care</span> <span data-start="572.78" data-end="578.42">for diversity ourselves. And first and over all, because I did vsty is just the right</span> <span data-start="578.42" data-end="585.09">thing to do. As various studies show I did vsty also enables us to solve complex problems</span> <span data-start="585.09" data-end="592.01">better and faster, be more creative and stimulated through persistent exposure to minority perspective,</span> <span data-start="592.01" data-end="599.36">make better decisions and generate more innovation this means if a community is not diverse,</span> <span data-start="599.36" data-end="608.45">it's broken. Diversity includes, age, ability, ethnicity, social economic class, personal</span> <span data-start="608.45" data-end="615.28">background, gender and far more. Still, people do not fit into single boxes, all of us fall</span> <span data-start="615.28" data-end="621.36">into a variety of dimensions, every one of us has had a different life experience and</span> <span data-start="621.36" data-end="626.8">perceives the world differently, thus, we need to take care as well about the intersections</span> <span data-start="626.8" data-end="636.33">of these groups. Let's take a look at some examples. According to the 2013\h‑‑ 89\hpercent</span> <span data-start="636.33" data-end="643.15">of contributors to Open Source are men. 11\hpercent are women. But this is not just about binary</span> <span data-start="643.15" data-end="649.78">gender system here. Currently, there's so little space for LGBTIQ people in Open Source</span> <span data-start="649.78" data-end="654.52">that they are not even numbers. And it's worse for people who are margin naturalized twice</span> <span data-start="654.52" data-end="661.82">or even more like, for example, women of color. We also needy versety, and ethnicity, white</span> <span data-start="661.82" data-end="666.13">people are still forming the major mass in Open Source, and we urgently need to get people</span> <span data-start="666.13" data-end="673.22">of all ethnicities into our project. We also need to aim for diversity and skills and get</span> <span data-start="673.22" data-end="677.97">non‑coding people, like designers, writer, people with organization skills and many more</span> <span data-start="677.97" data-end="684.67">on board. And we needy versety and ideas and back beyonde grounds, the broader the amount</span> <span data-start="684.67" data-end="692.18">of ideas, backgrounds and experiences in our communities, the further we can go. And we</span> <span data-start="692.18" data-end="697.85">need to aim for more. Working on diversity in our communities should be a daily task</span> <span data-start="697.85" data-end="705.71">for every one of us. Or to phrase it like Hartwig did recently on Twitter, when everyone</span> <span data-start="705.71" data-end="713.22">is making technology, the technology they make will be for everybody. Community means</span> <span data-start="713.22" data-end="717.42">the appreciation of diversity and variety.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="717.42" data-end="722.871">Community culture is our daily answer to the question who, which people, and what, which</span> <span data-start="722.871" data-end="731.32">kind of contributions are being welcomed and value in the our Open Source projects. Of</span> <span data-start="731.32" data-end="736.11">their strong values and goals behind Open Source development which is the reason why</span> <span data-start="736.11" data-end="742.99">it exists and it is kept alive. Some of these values are for example providing alternatives</span> <span data-start="742.99" data-end="749.38">for closed software enabling independence and driving innovation, but there's one more</span> <span data-start="749.38" data-end="756.01">reason why Open Source software is built. Software, in general, is built to perform</span> <span data-start="756.01" data-end="761.94">useful work, run a computer system, solve problems, offer solutions, make things better</span> <span data-start="761.94" data-end="771.65">and more. But, make things better for whom? Software is built for people. It's built for</span> <span data-start="771.65" data-end="782.25">users, any software exists for being used by someone. Of the number of developers in</span> <span data-start="782.25" data-end="788.46">this world is 18\hmillion people in total. That already includes lobbyists who are coding</span> <span data-start="788.46" data-end="797.62">as a hobby, and 18\hmillion in total is in comparison to the world population 0.26\hpercent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="797.62" data-end="802.68">Which means for every software developer out there there are 399 people who have other</span> <span data-start="802.68" data-end="807.98">professions or just don't code. Now, let me just give those 399 people a few more colors</span> <span data-start="807.98" data-end="814.53">to get them closer to reality, and there we go. When we're talking about software, we</span> <span data-start="814.53" data-end="820.09">can't have this conversation without talking about users. Software is built for them and</span> <span data-start="820.09" data-end="826.23">each of those 399 people have their very own individual needs. And even our software developer</span> <span data-start="826.23" data-end="833.29">themselves will also be a software user. This means that building software is an act of</span> <span data-start="833.29" data-end="839.01">representation (Audience: Yeah) many of us, the people that are here today are very privileged</span> <span data-start="839.01" data-end="844.751">and our realities are very far from those of millions of people on this planet. The</span> <span data-start="844.751" data-end="851.08">users of our software are very diverse group and representation means responsibility. As</span> <span data-start="851.08" data-end="856.7">people who work on software, we have this representation role to act according to. And</span> <span data-start="856.7" data-end="863.301">this is why non‑diverse communities working on software can just not be justified. Only</span> <span data-start="863.301" data-end="871.279">moving beyond self referential mode enable us to develop infratruck structure processes</span> <span data-start="871.279" data-end="874.45">and work that resonate with the broader population.</span> <span data-start="874.45" data-end="882.831">Misrep reseasonnation leads to serious issues, one of these illustrated here by J Katz. The</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="882.831" data-end="888.91">JavaScript community loves "good enough" solutions where good enough means horribly broken except</span> <span data-start="888.91" data-end="896.13">for my case. We already have representation problem in our community itself, and it's</span> <span data-start="896.13" data-end="901.2">not getting better outside this community. We have to fulfill our representation roles</span> <span data-start="901.2" data-end="908.05">properly in our communities, so we can finally enable people to really trust the software</span> <span data-start="908.05" data-end="914.11">we're building. Of I want to give you an example which depicts the trust issues by exposing</span> <span data-start="914.11" data-end="922.94">our user to far too often. The queer chorus, the group group in Austin, Texas had a Facebook</span> <span data-start="922.94" data-end="928.82">group for its choir members, the president of this chorus added two members of the group</span> <span data-start="928.82" data-end="935.16">to the Facebook group, what the president didn't know, Facebook automatically told all</span> <span data-start="935.16" data-end="941.49">their friends that they were now members of the queer chorus Facebook group. Thing is,</span> <span data-start="941.49" data-end="947.57">both those people had decided to not inform their friends and families about being queer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="947.57" data-end="953.21">It was Facebook that did that for them. By inadvertently exposing this information to</span> <span data-start="953.21" data-end="961.3">their friends and families. Facebook made a choice, instead of leaving it up to them.</span> <span data-start="961.3" data-end="966.17">Many more people have been stung by accidentally revealing secrets on‑line that were easier</span> <span data-start="966.17" data-end="972.29">kept in the past. We need to keep examples like this in mind and build software that</span> <span data-start="972.29" data-end="980.88">respects its users. The topic of proper user representation is also linked with one of</span> <span data-start="980.88" data-end="987.83">the core values and goals of Open Source. Freedom. Freedom is the idea of giving users</span> <span data-start="987.83" data-end="993.58">choices, power and control over the tools they use. It's often stated that users are</span> <span data-start="993.58" data-end="998.68">enabled to see how the apps they use work, check if they're secure and change them if</span> <span data-start="998.68" data-end="1005.18">they want to. So, let me ask you another question. And I'd ask you to raise your hands again.</span> <span data-start="1005.18" data-end="1012.339">Who, of you, has at least once read the source code of your mail server that your e‑mail</span> <span data-start="1012.339" data-end="1023.201">provider runs for you? Oh, one person\h‑‑ two\h‑‑ Kudos. So, we have to ask, how</span> <span data-start="1023.201" data-end="1028.92">many people actually can do this? How many people have not only the interest, but also</span> <span data-start="1028.92" data-end="1035.02">the resources and knowledge to check the source code of their software? How close do people's</span> <span data-start="1035.02" data-end="1041.96">actual realities can this idea of freedom actually be. The idea of long‑term freedom</span> <span data-start="1041.96" data-end="1046.73">for users through Open Source is a great goal, which we have to perceive. But we have to</span> <span data-start="1046.73" data-end="1052.42">take care to not make this a patron nicing ideal that forgets about people's realities.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1052.42" data-end="1059.17">Instead, we have to build products that understand people's needs and their capabilities and</span> <span data-start="1059.17" data-end="1064.28">we have to build them in diverse communities. So we can make this ideal of freedom a thing</span> <span data-start="1064.28" data-end="1070.04">that is closer to people's realities than it is now.</span> <span data-start="1070.04" data-end="1077.4">Another danger is currently facing is shown by what happened to the Mayans, although they</span> <span data-start="1077.4" data-end="1086.73">were highly developed civilization was developed suddenly disappeared around 800‑900 BC,</span> <span data-start="1086.73" data-end="1094.11">some archaeologist say that it was merely a collapse of the ruling elites, this theory</span> <span data-start="1094.11" data-end="1099.02">can't be proven a hundred percent, but the Maya show us that it's neither change nor</span> <span data-start="1099.02" data-end="1107.46">technology that threaten the integrity of a culture. They had enough culture change</span> <span data-start="1107.46" data-end="1115.97">and technology, it wasn't that that threatened them, it was power. The cruel face of domination.</span> <span data-start="1115.97" data-end="1120.77">If the needs of individuals in one culture are continually suppressed social systems</span> <span data-start="1120.77" data-end="1128.07">can become unstable. One person in the Fedora study project, which I mentioned before said,</span> <span data-start="1128.07" data-end="1133.88">"I used to believe this this project was a community, but it seems more like a grouping</span> <span data-start="1133.88" data-end="1141.39">of various anarchists and monarchists who think everyone else is like them." We rally</span> <span data-start="1141.39" data-end="1146.66">have to take care to avoid clicks and elites that exclude community members and enforce</span> <span data-start="1146.66" data-end="1153.37">those unhealthy power structures which destabilize our communities. We have to stop the marginalizelization</span> <span data-start="1153.37" data-end="1160.41">of people, the worshiping of heros, rock stores, code unicorns and people that cannot be criticized</span> <span data-start="1160.41" data-end="1167.809">anymore because of their status. This leads us to two other core concepts and goals of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1167.809" data-end="1175.01">Open Source which is decentralize and democracy. Data shows that Open Source software is not</span> <span data-start="1175.01" data-end="1181.77">quite as democratic and de‑centralized as it claims to be. Analysis shows of 5\hbillion</span> <span data-start="1181.77" data-end="1192.74">bytes of source code 74\hpercent was written by the most active users. Democracy and decentrallization</span> <span data-start="1192.74" data-end="1199.29">of Open Source will require diverse communities to enable more stable democratic processes</span> <span data-start="1199.29" data-end="1208.28">and achieving real decentraltion. Open Source project often also proudly refer to their</span> <span data-start="1208.28" data-end="1212.81">Meritocracy, the belief that those with merit throw to the top that they should be given</span> <span data-start="1212.81" data-end="1224.549">more opportunities and rewards, sadly the term Meritocracy was negatively coined for</span> <span data-start="1224.549" data-end="1232.1">a system with highly critical approaches. Slater cently described it as a sort of meter</span> <span data-start="1232.1" data-end="1237.65">story which we repeat to each other and which we use to construct other stories that then</span> <span data-start="1237.65" data-end="1243.66">explain things, for example, while people are included or excluded from our projects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1243.66" data-end="1249.21">Per tot crazies often sell\h‑‑\h‑‑ celebrated as objectives the, home general</span> <span data-start="1249.21" data-end="1261.47">nosty of Open Source it exacerbates institutional liesed I believe equality\h‑‑\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1261.47" data-end="1267.13">we have to find new models to value contribution. When you're thinking about building the few</span> <span data-start="1267.13" data-end="1272.679">lure of Open Source, we have to include those who have less opportunity, less time, and</span> <span data-start="1272.679" data-end="1279.1">less money that would allow them to freely contribute. We need to rethink what is being</span> <span data-start="1279.1" data-end="1283.78">valued in Open Source projects, especially with the needs of mar Nan naturalized people</span> <span data-start="1283.78" data-end="1294.15">in our minds (Mganilized) and our main question should always be, two we care for? Do we care</span> <span data-start="1294.15" data-end="1301.64">for contributors who contribute or do we care for people? This question is an essential</span> <span data-start="1301.64" data-end="1307.88">one and a topic that is near and dear to me. People in our Open Source communities experience</span> <span data-start="1307.88" data-end="1313.78">not only good times, they experience bad times, burnouts, mental health issues like depression</span> <span data-start="1313.78" data-end="1315.81">and much more.</span> <span data-start="1315.81" data-end="1320.19">These are serious issues which we can't ignore. And some of them are even enforced through</span> <span data-start="1320.19" data-end="1327.62">structural inequality, Mertocr averciy and community related issues, we as members of</span> <span data-start="1327.62" data-end="1332.679">Open Source communities have to implement a culture where mental health issues are not</span> <span data-start="1332.679" data-end="1338.45">sigmatized. Where we talk openly about them and lead an open discussion about how to avoid</span> <span data-start="1338.45" data-end="1345.09">people burning out through Open Source contributions. We have to implement a culture in which people</span> <span data-start="1345.09" data-end="1349.82">are heard and they know that there are people who care for them. We have to make sure to</span> <span data-start="1349.82" data-end="1355.299">be there for the people in our projects and communities. Not because we want them to keep</span> <span data-start="1355.299" data-end="1363.861">contributing, but because we care for the people. You know that in our bodies with have</span> <span data-start="1363.861" data-end="1370.26">arteries and veins, both parts of our circulatory system. Arteries are the blood vessels that</span> <span data-start="1370.26" data-end="1377.73">carry blood away from the heart, mostly oxygenated blood. There's a special coronary artery located</span> <span data-start="1377.73" data-end="1383.809">directly at our heart. Its job is to supply blood to the heart muscle and thus keep it</span> <span data-start="1383.809" data-end="1390.41">working. Still, it sometimes happens that there's plaque build up along the inner walls</span> <span data-start="1390.41" data-end="1396.27">of the artery of the heart. This plaque mare rows the artery, reduces blood flow to the</span> <span data-start="1396.27" data-end="1402.51">heart. It can progress without anyone noticing evidence of it for years, and what happens</span> <span data-start="1402.51" data-end="1409.73">there is called coronary artery disease. As it progresses, it leads to lack of rock general</span> <span data-start="1409.73" data-end="1417.98">in the body's cells, can cause chest pain and finally lead to death. In Open Source,</span> <span data-start="1417.98" data-end="1424.559">our communities are our hearts. They neurorich the entire body, our projects, without our</span> <span data-start="1424.559" data-end="1430.37">communities, Open Source is lost. Narrowing those communities by limiting and restricting</span> <span data-start="1430.37" data-end="1436.82">their spaces leads to serious problems. For individuals, communities, the products we're</span> <span data-start="1436.82" data-end="1440.84">building, and finally endangers the future of Open Source in general.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1440.84" data-end="1447.29">There are already many initiatives and individuals in Open Source and tech that are working on</span> <span data-start="1447.29" data-end="1453.05">improving all those topics. These people and their allies are spending a significant amount</span> <span data-start="1453.05" data-end="1459.429">of time on improving the culture we have in Open Source today. Some of them are, for example,</span> <span data-start="1459.429" data-end="1467.82">black girls code, LGBT tech, model view culture, Trans tech and many more. The least we all</span> <span data-start="1467.82" data-end="1475.24">should do is listen to them. Support their work, share what they're saying. And transfer</span> <span data-start="1475.24" data-end="1482.58">this to the communities we're all in. We have to widen our communities, welcome and appreciate</span> <span data-start="1482.58" data-end="1488.01">everyone to ensure that our heart keeps beating and to ensure that Open Source can have a</span> <span data-start="1488.01" data-end="1495.38">future. Because Open Source can only have a future if it does everything to be inclusive.</span> <span data-start="1495.38" data-end="1496.38">Thank you. (Applause) >> Wow! Thank you, Lena. Before we start with</span> <span data-start="1496.38" data-end="1497.38">the next talk, we'll\h‑‑ we get set up and I think we'll have another four minutes</span> <span data-start="1497.38" data-end="1498.38">to catch up with the other tracks, so take your time, we'll start in a little bit. Thank</span> </p>
