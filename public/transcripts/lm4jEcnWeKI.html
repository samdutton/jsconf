data-end="1458.56">you can't in the back but I'll skim</span> <span data-start="1458.56" data-end="1459.79">through it really quick I'm not going to</span> <span data-start="1459.79" data-end="1461.56">dwell on this for too long</span> <span data-start="1461.56" data-end="1463.69">interestingly on the screen it's</span> <span data-start="1463.69" data-end="1465.61">down so I can barely read it so let me</span> <span data-start="1465.61" data-end="1467.5">lean in all right it's cool so we've got</span> <span data-start="1467.5" data-end="1470.259">rules which is an internal array a</span> <span data-start="1470.259" data-end="1472">convenience method of get current rule</span> <span data-start="1472" data-end="1474.879">which just says what M the current what</span> <span data-start="1474.879" data-end="1478.539">rule am I currently working on I have a</span> <span data-start="1478.539" data-end="1481.269">whene method there that that kicks off</span> <span data-start="1481.269" data-end="1483.909">the rules who remember it says when</span> <span data-start="1483.909" data-end="1485.769">internationally when domestically that</span> <span data-start="1485.769" data-end="1487.899">starts off the rule so all I do is I</span> <span data-start="1487.899" data-end="1490.299">just add an empty object there for</span> <span data-start="1490.299" data-end="1492.639">domestically and for internationally I</span> <span data-start="1492.639" data-end="1495.549">grab the current rule and I just tack on</span> <span data-start="1495.549" data-end="1497.259">a property that's a boolean flag of is</span> <span data-start="1497.259" data-end="1498.94">domestic and toggle it appropriately</span> <span data-start="1498.94" data-end="1500.98">true or false and this kicks off any</span> <span data-start="1500.98" data-end="1502.24">rule so you can add as many rules as you</span> <span data-start="1502.24" data-end="1506.23">want then I get into the if you know I</span> <span data-start="1506.23" data-end="1507.82">promised myself in this talk I wouldn't</span> <span data-start="1507.82" data-end="1509.649">use then and then if because it'd be</span> <span data-start="1509.649" data-end="1511.36">confusing but I just did I'm apologized</span> <span data-start="1511.36" data-end="1514.96">so then doing it again you can't use if</span> <span data-start="1514.96" data-end="1517">because it's a it's a reserved word so</span> <span data-start="1517" data-end="1519.21">you just use square brackets to use it</span> <span data-start="1519.21" data-end="1523.029">you grab the current rule if the</span> <span data-start="1523.029" data-end="1525.399">conditions are already there then then</span> <span data-start="1525.399" data-end="1527.44">you use them otherwise you assign them</span> <span data-start="1527.44" data-end="1529.929">to empty array you push that on to the</span> <span data-start="1529.929" data-end="1532.36">conditions etc etc I'm sorry I'm reading</span> <span data-start="1532.36" data-end="1534.46">code but it's very fascinating to me I</span> <span data-start="1534.46" data-end="1538.36">suppose then is just synonym for if so I</span> <span data-start="1538.36" data-end="1539.82">just assign it back to each other</span> <span data-start="1539.82" data-end="1542.95">and then with get current condition</span> <span data-start="1542.95" data-end="1544.48">another convenience method that just</span> <span data-start="1544.48" data-end="1546.669">grabs the nth condition just like we</span> <span data-start="1546.669" data-end="1550.539">grab the nth rule and then for the rest</span> <span data-start="1550.539" data-end="1552.19">of the DSL it's just a simple matter of</span> <span data-start="1552.19" data-end="1554.259">grabbing the current condition adding</span> <span data-start="1554.259" data-end="1556.57">the appropriate properties and then</span> <span data-start="1556.57" data-end="1558.34">returning this as I as we were before so</span> <span data-start="1558.34" data-end="1560.289">we can keep the method chain going and</span> <span data-start="1560.289" data-end="1563.47">then finally we just call build and in</span> <span data-start="1563.47" data-end="1565.45">this particular case our shipping cost</span> <span data-start="1565.45" data-end="1568.179">calculator constructs its own domain and</span> <span data-start="1568.179" data-end="1569.799">all we have to do is just give it the</span> <span data-start="1569.799" data-end="1572.919">the rules array that looks like this</span> <span data-start="1572.919" data-end="1575.409">when you see realize it so it's a very</span> <span data-start="1575.409" data-end="1577.6">consumable thing by something that's</span> <span data-start="1577.6" data-end="1579.96">configuring and constructing a domain</span> <span data-start="1579.96" data-end="1584.62">now one of the the most important thing</span> <span data-start="1584.62" data-end="1586.96">in my opinion the most useful and</span> <span data-start="1586.96" data-end="1590.59">important aspect of all dsls is that as</span> <span data-start="1590.59" data-end="1595.48">time goes on your your actual domain the</span> <span data-start="1595.48" data-end="1596.95">domain model behind the scenes will get</span> <span data-start="1596.95" data-end="1597.36">more</span> <span data-start="1597.36" data-end="1599.49">and more and more complex just happens</span> <span data-start="1599.49" data-end="1602.58">over time but the DSL because it came</span> <span data-start="1602.58" data-end="1604.62">from you know human thinking about the</span> <span data-start="1604.62" data-end="1607.91">problem tends to remain more or less</span> <span data-start="1607.91" data-end="1610.32">consistent if you will because there's a</span> <span data-start="1610.32" data-end="1613.32">limit to how complex humans can think of</span> <span data-start="1613.32" data-end="1614.64">things but there's no limit to how</span> <span data-start="1614.64" data-end="1618.66">complex things can actually be for</span> <span data-start="1618.66" data-end="1621.48">example one day hopefully we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1621.48" data-end="1623.22">have packages that can be delivered with</span> <span data-start="1623.22" data-end="1625.98">drones so when that day comes we will</span> <span data-start="1625.98" data-end="1629.43">have a rich very complicated domain</span> <span data-start="1629.43" data-end="1631.35">model behind the scenes that deal with</span> <span data-start="1631.35" data-end="1632.79">all types of things like weather and</span> <span data-start="1632.79" data-end="1635.16">battery charge and route and you know</span> <span data-start="1635.16"

this when you're</span> <span data-start="1640.71" data-end="1642.24">shipping with drones that the weather is</span> <span data-start="1642.24" data-end="1643.7">favorable and as cheaply as
