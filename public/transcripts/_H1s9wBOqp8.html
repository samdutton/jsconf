<p><span data-start="101.69" data-end="106.61">So before I became a developer, I was convinced that I would become an architect because all</span> <span data-start="106.61" data-end="113.07">of my life, I drew ammunition and I painted things and I really liked making art.</span> <span data-start="113.07" data-end="123.729">But it turns out that art is kind of hard.</span> <span data-start="123.729" data-end="128.659">My kitchen is now covered in, like, tiny little pots because I can't make, like, cups that</span> <span data-start="128.659" data-end="130.53">are human sized yet because I don't know how.</span> <span data-start="130.53" data-end="132.51">So I just have cups for dolls right now.</span> <span data-start="132.51" data-end="136.12">And so art is really hard.</span> <span data-start="136.12" data-end="149.39">And even if you're a really talented painter like van Gogh, even if you're naturally talented.</span> <span data-start="149.39" data-end="155.44">When  —  you start having different problems like my composition is off, my colors are</span> <span data-start="155.44" data-end="156.44">off.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.44" data-end="158.41">It doesn't express the thing that I really want.</span> <span data-start="158.41" data-end="165.79">This time at Christmas, like, 15 years ago, I came home and my mom was, like, oh, I gotta</span> <span data-start="165.79" data-end="171.76">show you this thing that I discovered and she shows me this amazing painting of a landscape,</span> <span data-start="171.76" data-end="177.549">or a street in Paris, I don't remember.</span> <span data-start="177.549" data-end="178.81">Not a talented person.</span> <span data-start="178.81" data-end="179.999">She's not an artistic person.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="179.999" data-end="180.999">She can draw.</span> <span data-start="180.999" data-end="183.25">And I said, how have you managed to produce this?</span> <span data-start="183.25" data-end="185.31">And as it turns out, it was a paint by numbers.</span> <span data-start="185.31" data-end="190.67">And that's what I realized was that people really enjoy making art, even if they're not</span> <span data-start="190.67" data-end="192.989">good at it if you give them the right tools.</span> <span data-start="192.989" data-end="196.739">So in this case, paint by numbers is really good if you're not talented.</span> <span data-start="196.739" data-end="202.689">It restricts the problem to something really small and in the end you get this awesome</span> <span data-start="202.689" data-end="206.489">thing that looks pretty and then you get to show it to people.</span> <span data-start="206.489" data-end="207.489">Because art is fun.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.489" data-end="212.05">You get to make things, you get to spend a little bit of time and produce something.</span> <span data-start="212.05" data-end="213.349">And sharing art is really fun.</span> <span data-start="213.349" data-end="217.419">She didn't, like, make this painting and, like, hide it away in the basement.</span> <span data-start="217.419" data-end="220.769">She showed it to me and said, look at this thing I made I'm awesome.</span> <span data-start="220.769" data-end="222.299">I'm van Gogh.</span> <span data-start="222.299" data-end="223.459">She's not.</span> <span data-start="223.459" data-end="229.159">And we know sharing art is fun because who here has  —  raise your hand if you've never</span> <span data-start="229.159" data-end="232.43">taken a photo and put it on the Internet.</span> <span data-start="232.43" data-end="237.209">Yeah, nobody  —  everybody takes photos and you put them on the Internet so all your friends</span> <span data-start="237.209" data-end="238.209">see them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="238.209" data-end="241.659">There's a whole industry of apps that put filters on your Instagram photos so that they're</span> <span data-start="241.659" data-end="242.779">pretty and artsy.</span> <span data-start="242.78" data-end="247.22">Last year, this, like, app came out that was called Prisma, and it made everything look</span> <span data-start="247.22" data-end="250.02">like a painting and it was super popular for three weeks.</span> <span data-start="250.02" data-end="255.86">Because we like making shit and saying, look at what I made, look at my artistic talent.</span> <span data-start="255.86" data-end="260.03">And do you know what's good about sharing?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="260.03" data-end="264.19">All of these things are on the web on this fantastic cloud we have, we don't print them</span> <span data-start="264.19" data-end="268.3">out and give them to people anymore, we put them on the website.</span> <span data-start="268.3" data-end="276.05">So I'm going to show you some things that I've put on the web.</span> <span data-start="276.05" data-end="278.94">So the first thing one is something called Octopus Holdings.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.94" data-end="284.99">So John and I'm going to butcher his last name, Hergenrother, basically made this thing</span> <span data-start="284.99" data-end="293.9">where you could represent words in an URL, so this is cat using a necktie with pants</span> <span data-start="293.9" data-end="301.65">on an elephants and it's really easy to share because you can show people what you made.</span> <span data-start="301.65" data-end="308.47">And it's very easy to understand because the problem of you making art is very simple.</span> <span data-start="308.47" data-end="310.83">You can only, like, use emoji and it's really amazing.</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="315.259">It's kind of fun, you get to make fun things.</span> <span data-start="315.259" data-end="318.34">The reason that it's called An Octopus Holdings is because if you don't make anything, it's,</span> <span data-start="318.34" data-end="320.639">like, an octopus holding a trophy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="320.639" data-end="322.77">It's awesome.</span> <span data-start="322.77" data-end="339.169">Jen Schiffer made think project, pixels are easier, there's fewer of them.</span> <span data-start="339.169" data-end="341.57">You can increase the resolution.</span> <span data-start="341.57" data-end="345.449">The colors are more limited and you get to, like  —  this is my attempt to draw a cat and</span> <span data-start="345.449" data-end="346.96">it's terrible.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346.96" data-end="350.18">But the reason why I know it's really fun and people really like it, and, again, people</span> <span data-start="350.18" data-end="354.931">really like sharing this art, is that a lot of people will tweet at her and say, look</span> <span data-start="354.931" data-end="359.639">at this thing, I've made a Make Art to work on a game for a kid who's six.</span> <span data-start="359.639" data-end="367.97">And this is amazing, we're, like, exposing kids to making art with code and technology</span> <span data-start="367.97" data-end="369.97">early on, which is kind of awesome.</span> <span data-start="369.97" data-end="379.169">On a similar vein, my friend Wan made this Mega Emoji, where instead of drawing with</span> <span data-start="379.169" data-end="382.12">art, you do it with emoji.</span> <span data-start="382.12" data-end="385.34">So that takes another real world thing like tracing.</span> <span data-start="385.34" data-end="390.02">Sometimes you'll trace it on a piece of paper.</span> <span data-start="390.02" data-end="391.27">So this is a lot like that.</span> <span data-start="391.27" data-end="395.65">I had a really bad day once, so I spent an hour making dumb shit.</span> <span data-start="395.65" data-end="399.74">This is a cat that I've made out of emojis using Mega Emoji and it was really fun because</span> <span data-start="399.74" data-end="404.8">it was really simple and I just traced the cat emoji.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="404.8" data-end="409.599">And now and, like, it all circles out, I started out with emojis, and then the drawing, and</span> <span data-start="409.599" data-end="410.729">then back to emoji.</span> <span data-start="410.729" data-end="417.04">This is Emojibrush that Sam Sico made, and it's literally a canvas and you draw with</span> <span data-start="417.04" data-end="419.62">emojis and that's all you do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="419.62" data-end="423.479">And people use it to make dumb things with it.</span> <span data-start="423.479" data-end="432.379">I think Kia, she's @LadyLead on Twitter.</span> <span data-start="432.379" data-end="435.729">And she would say, I made your Twitter on Emoji Brush.</span> <span data-start="435.729" data-end="442.689">And this is really fun because it's a really easy and, like, a joyful project to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="442.689" data-end="448.389">And the reason I'm telling you all of this because I think we're really good at making</span> <span data-start="448.389" data-end="451.8">art more accessible and more friendly by giving them better brushes.</span> <span data-start="451.8" data-end="454.319">We've, like, learned this over the years.</span> <span data-start="454.319" data-end="458.68">We have color by numbers, we have tracing, we have all these other apps that make it</span> <span data-start="458.68" data-end="461.33">really easy for you create things.</span> <span data-start="461.33" data-end="465.5">And so if you believe me that's true, I think the same thing is true for the web, the web</span> <span data-start="465.5" data-end="470.02">can be more accessible, and fun, and by that I mean, making things on the web can be more</span> <span data-start="470.02" data-end="475.659">accessible and fun if you give them better brushes because the same argument can be made</span> <span data-start="475.659" data-end="478.229">for both things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="478.229" data-end="482.389">And by better brushes, it's like making a better div because I like the div because</span> <span data-start="482.389" data-end="488.59">it's like the pen and pencil, you still have to learn how to hold the div, and vertically</span> <span data-start="488.59" data-end="494.77">size it, and how to center it, and all sorts of things like that.</span> <span data-start="494.77" data-end="498.72">So the web is really good at semantics.</span> <span data-start="498.72" data-end="504.18">And in HTML 5, we've got awesome things like header, and nav, and article that tell you</span> <span data-start="504.18" data-end="505.18">what those elements do.</span> <span data-start="505.18" data-end="506.68">They don't look any different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="506.68" data-end="511.449">They just look like, you know, divs of text but at least they tell what they're supposed</span> <span data-start="511.449" data-end="512.449">to do.</span> <span data-start="512.449" data-end="515.219">So if you put a header, that should probably be at the top, and the article somewhere in</span> <span data-start="515.219" data-end="520.21">the middle, and then the footer at the bottom, and the future you is going to read this page.</span> <span data-start="520.21" data-end="526.529">It would be much easier if you had a pile of divs where hopefully you put a class="header"</span> <span data-start="526.529" data-end="530.94">somewhere so that you knew that I meant to put this at the top.</span> <span data-start="530.94" data-end="535.86">The other thing that the web is really good at is encapsulation and this is one of my</span> <span data-start="535.86" data-end="537.68">favorite things about the web.</span> <span data-start="537.68" data-end="542.31">So there are, like, these magical elements in the browser that do magical things, like</span> <span data-start="542.31" data-end="548.04">video, or input, like input has 21 different types and you can do color picking and input</span> <span data-start="548.04" data-end="552.43">different files but you don't have to wonder how they're implemented, they just come to</span> <span data-start="552.43" data-end="557.2">you and you're like, sweet, this is amazing.</span> <span data-start="557.2" data-end="568.44">But if you peek inside of them, if you go on Chrome, and you look at enableShadow Roots,</span> <span data-start="568.44" data-end="572.24">if you look at, it's a content-editable div, that's pretty cool.</span> <span data-start="572.24" data-end="579.57">There's one that lets you put a number on it, a number flicker that goes up and down,</span> <span data-start="579.57" data-end="582.55">it's already more complicated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.55" data-end="597.1">It has some pseudos in it  that can be, like, a bridge that's like, I</span> <span data-start="597.1" data-end="602.58">really need to style this spin button and the reason why this is important because these</span> <span data-start="602.58" data-end="606.27">divs and these styles don't go outside of the input element.</span> <span data-start="606.27" data-end="609.75">That's why you can't reach and style everything in it.</span> <span data-start="609.75" data-end="612.93">You can only style things that, like, that element really wants you to style.</span> <span data-start="612.93" data-end="614.65">And that's why encapsulation is awesome.</span> <span data-start="614.65" data-end="620.12">So something like a video element is actually ginormous and terrifying.</span> <span data-start="620.12" data-end="624.98">It's got, like, ranges and buttons, and a shit ton of divs and yeah.</span> <span data-start="624.98" data-end="629">So cool, encapsulation is really awesome.</span> <span data-start="629" data-end="632.43">So if semantics are awesome and encapsulation are awesome, that means that we can, like,</span> <span data-start="632.43" data-end="635.89">keep waiting and it's going to give us something like a Emoji Brush, it's semantic expressive,</span> <span data-start="635.89" data-end="642">and it's emoji, and it's impressive because it's impressive how God knows how Sam implemented</span> <span data-start="642" data-end="643.53">this.</span> <span data-start="643.53" data-end="651.93">But we can't just put an emoji brush in Chrome, that's not a thing that we can do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="651.93" data-end="653.68">But that's why I like web components.</span> <span data-start="653.68" data-end="660.91">It takes semantics and ability that the browser already has and giving it to you as developers</span> <span data-start="660.91" data-end="662.76">so that you can use them yourselves.</span> <span data-start="662.76" data-end="668.87">And the components are not special by themselves.</span> <span data-start="668.87" data-end="674.23">The reason why web components are really awesome is they're web agnostic.</span> <span data-start="674.23" data-end="681.57">And you can use it in an React dev, or use it in Ember because Thomas is sitting right</span> <span data-start="681.57" data-end="685.23">there and I have to mention Ember.</span> <span data-start="685.23" data-end="687.98">And they're really awesome because they interop with everything.</span> <span data-start="687.98" data-end="689.85">Because they're browser language.</span> <span data-start="689.85" data-end="695.56">Anywhere you can use an input, you can use this and that's awesome.</span> <span data-start="695.56" data-end="697.589">And that's what I work on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="697.589" data-end="703.32">But let's talk about art again as we were already talking about.</span> <span data-start="703.32" data-end="705.18">So we make art with brushes.</span> <span data-start="705.18" data-end="709.94">We, like, paint on things, we, like, trace things and we make apps with components and</span> <span data-start="709.94" data-end="713.94">better our brushes are, the better our art is, or the easier our art is.</span> <span data-start="713.94" data-end="719.47">So the better our components are, the easier our apps are going to be able to built, too.</span> <span data-start="719.47" data-end="724.38">So I just wanted to show you, I built this really dumb app called emojillate.</span> <span data-start="724.38" data-end="732.62">And basically it takes an image and pixelates it, and replaces every pixel with an emoji</span> <span data-start="732.62" data-end="739.821">and you can change the resolution so it has more emoji, less emoji, and you can copy and</span> <span data-start="739.821" data-end="745.04">paste it, and send it to all of your friends manipulated to tell you how I built this out</span> <span data-start="745.04" data-end="748.45">of web components because I thought that was kind of fun.</span> <span data-start="748.45" data-end="754.76">So if you looked at this enormous app, we have an input type="file," which is kind of</span> <span data-start="754.76" data-end="762.62">an OG web component so that's cool and then we also have a paper slider.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="762.62" data-end="767.14">So this is an element that my team works on, and paper is code word for material design</span> <span data-start="767.14" data-end="768.14">at Google.</span> <span data-start="768.14" data-end="771.44">It was a terrible naming choice that now stuck forever.</span> <span data-start="771.44" data-end="776.53">But that's a fancier slider because if you ever try to style a native input type="range"</span> <span data-start="776.53" data-end="782.1">it's, like, 150 lines of CSS and pseudo-elements.</span> <span data-start="782.1" data-end="787.18">That's fancier slider and it looks pretty.</span> <span data-start="787.18" data-end="790.79">And in the middle, I have this giant emojillate element.</span> <span data-start="790.79" data-end="795.77">And it basically collects things from the files.</span> <span data-start="795.77" data-end="799.31">So it collects, like, the file contents and then it collects things from the configuration.</span> <span data-start="799.31" data-end="804.22">So, like, the number of pixels on either side and stuff like that, and every time it gets</span> <span data-start="804.22" data-end="805.22">changed, it gets updated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="805.22" data-end="810.74">And the reason why this is important is because these changes are really easy if you've got,</span> <span data-start="810.74" data-end="814.67">like, a data-binding sort of system and that's where Polymer comes into play because I told</span> <span data-start="814.67" data-end="815.67">you that I worked on Polymer.</span> <span data-start="815.67" data-end="818.62">So Polymer is kind of like jQuery.</span> <span data-start="818.62" data-end="823.08">I'm trying to, like, pitch this sentence about it.</span> <span data-start="823.08" data-end="827.11">So I think Polymer is kind of like jQuery for web components not in the sense that,</span> <span data-start="827.11" data-end="830.24">like, you don't need it anymore and everybody hates it, and includes, like, seven versions</span> <span data-start="830.24" data-end="837.22">of it on their site but in the sense that it sugars the DOM and makes DOM interactions</span> <span data-start="837.22" data-end="841.52">a bit easier while waiting for the DOM to actually get a bit better because 15 years</span> <span data-start="841.52" data-end="846.83">ago, or 12 years ago I didn't write C++, writing jQuery.</span> <span data-start="846.83" data-end="856.73">But writing child nodes and manipulating child nodes and working on the DOM was kind of a</span> <span data-start="856.73" data-end="857.73">pain.</span> <span data-start="857.73" data-end="862.802">Well, Polymer now, web components are kind of new and I secretly hope one day that we're</span> <span data-start="862.802" data-end="869.62">going to get native data binding on the web, and I keep trying to pitch this to the link</span> <span data-start="869.62" data-end="870.62">team.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="870.62" data-end="873.5">But the way that data binding works is if you look at this emojillate element in the</span> <span data-start="873.5" data-end="879.55">middle, it has a file, and a file contents, or whatever, and then of a an input type="file"</span> <span data-start="879.55" data-end="887.11">at the top and we're pretending that the API is actually sane and it does which you want,</span> <span data-start="887.11" data-end="888.48">which it doesn't.</span> <span data-start="888.48" data-end="895.27">But if you had some file like containDataBlob, then you could change it magically and say,</span> <span data-start="895.27" data-end="898.77">whenever this thing changes, teleport it over here.</span> <span data-start="898.77" data-end="904.9">The reason why this is a lie is you need a JavaScript to respond to that input type="file"</span> <span data-start="904.9" data-end="908.87">but, you know, it's nice in our dreams.</span> <span data-start="908.87" data-end="910.44">The resolution is nice, too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="910.44" data-end="915.5">So whenever move that slider and its value changes, then the resolution changes and you</span> <span data-start="915.5" data-end="916.5">can put in a custom element.</span> <span data-start="916.5" data-end="918.61">And at this point I haven't written any JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="918.61" data-end="923.94">I've just written HTML and used data bindings because Polymer have sugared it for me.</span> <span data-start="923.94" data-end="929.46">And I put in a checkbox because one of the things that emojillate can do is help you</span> <span data-start="929.46" data-end="935.59">slow or hide the background image to make it bit prettier.</span> <span data-start="935.59" data-end="938.46">So this emojillate element isn't really that weird.</span> <span data-start="938.46" data-end="942.53">I wanted to show you that it's, like, platformy, and not, like, this weird code that you're</span> <span data-start="942.53" data-end="943.56">not familiar with.</span> <span data-start="943.56" data-end="946.47">There are two parts of defining a web component.</span> <span data-start="946.47" data-end="951.39">You have so sort of provide prototypes, write a class that says what that element does and</span> <span data-start="951.39" data-end="955.29">then you have to tell the browser to associate a particular element with that prototype.</span> <span data-start="955.29" data-end="959.38">So that class is just a normal class that extends an HTML element and then the second</span> <span data-start="959.38" data-end="967.96">part of it is saying, hey, browser, whenever you see emojillate on an element, put it over</span> <span data-start="967.96" data-end="968.96">there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.96" data-end="973.73">And Polymer 2 is something that we're announcing at IO.</span> <span data-start="973.73" data-end="979.45">Polymer is an extension, it extends an HTML element, so basically it takes whatever you</span> <span data-start="979.45" data-end="984.13">would normally do and then adds some sugar to it.</span> <span data-start="984.13" data-end="988.35">And then it wraps it all nicely in what we call a taco because what I really like to</span> <span data-start="988.35" data-end="993.43">do is write my HTML in HTML, and my CSS in CSS, and not JavaScript, I'm sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="993.43" data-end="998.1">And so one of the things that we can do in Polymer is actually provide what this element</span> <span data-start="998.1" data-end="999.96">looks like in html.</span> <span data-start="999.96" data-end="1004.271">So this element has a hidden canvas where I'm rendering this pixelated image and it</span> <span data-start="1004.271" data-end="1013.05">has a hidden image where I've loaded the file that you've given me and the code isn't really</span> <span data-start="1013.05" data-end="1014.05">hard.</span> <span data-start="1014.05" data-end="1015.05">I have a properties block.</span> <span data-start="1015.05" data-end="1019.44">I have some properties that this element cares about like that file in resolution, and that</span> <span data-start="1019.44" data-end="1023.78">checkbox where I was binding and then I have, like, JavaScript functions and then whenever</span> <span data-start="1023.78" data-end="1027.76">that resolution changes, I can just call an observer and then it calls it for me.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1027.76" data-end="1029.36">Now, this isn't very hard.</span> <span data-start="1029.36" data-end="1034.689">You could write this in vanilla JavaScript, it's just a getter and a setter for a thing</span> <span data-start="1034.689" data-end="1036.12">called resolution.</span> <span data-start="1036.12" data-end="1040.079">But you don't need to write it, you don't have to write it, so that's why Polymer does</span> <span data-start="1040.079" data-end="1041.62">it for you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1041.62" data-end="1044.61">It does all the heavy lifting for you.</span> <span data-start="1044.61" data-end="1045.929">That's all the code I'm going to show you.</span> <span data-start="1045.929" data-end="1047.87">So let's talk about art again.</span> <span data-start="1047.87" data-end="1051.21">How does emojillate actually work.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1051.21" data-end="1055.61">So it pixelates and adds emojis to it, and that's why we have this dumb name but the</span> <span data-start="1055.61" data-end="1059.72">really interesting question was should it use a canvas and should it use a span?</span> <span data-start="1059.72" data-end="1063.49">They're both going to look the same in the end but I really wanted to use the span because</span> <span data-start="1063.49" data-end="1065.41">we're going back to this idea of sharing art.</span> <span data-start="1065.41" data-end="1069.96">I want people to be able to share these dumb productions that you make with emojillate</span> <span data-start="1069.96" data-end="1075.97">and then if you share, you can copy and paste it, and send it on Slack to all of your friends,</span> <span data-start="1075.97" data-end="1080.04">and everyone is going to be happy because all your history is going to be blown forever</span> <span data-start="1080.04" data-end="1081.9">and ever.</span> <span data-start="1081.9" data-end="1090.6">My team's name was Voltron, and I think Sarah Edo said this recently that every project,</span> <span data-start="1090.6" data-end="1097.8">and every team has named at some point Voltron, and it's usually an awful combination of things</span> <span data-start="1097.8" data-end="1099.14">being glued together.</span> <span data-start="1099.14" data-end="1101.91">That's my team.</span> <span data-start="1101.91" data-end="1103.4">So how do we actually emojillate?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1103.4" data-end="1105.33">How does it actually work?</span> <span data-start="1105.33" data-end="1109.88">First thing we do is you load your file and I put into a hidden image.</span> <span data-start="1109.88" data-end="1114.36">And this is the image that I'm using, it's got lemons.</span> <span data-start="1114.36" data-end="1121.49">And then each to find the ratio of the canvas so that your image isn't super wobbly.</span> <span data-start="1121.49" data-end="1129.03">So I'm going to widen the canvas and then I'm going to pixelate it.</span> <span data-start="1129.03" data-end="1137.03">It's like something that we take a tiny image and you stretch it out, and it looks like</span> <span data-start="1137.03" data-end="1138.33">an enormous potato.</span> <span data-start="1138.33" data-end="1139.94">So that's how we pixelate.</span> <span data-start="1139.94" data-end="1144.28">So you take an image and bam, pixels.</span> <span data-start="1144.28" data-end="1150.63">Now, if I wanted to pixelate it, I could stop here, but we want to put an emoji on it.</span> <span data-start="1150.63" data-end="1157.17">So I'm going to divide this into a resolution sort of grid because here it's eight chunks</span> <span data-start="1157.17" data-end="1164.69">that I want to split across and for each of these chunks, the canvas API gives you an</span> <span data-start="1164.69" data-end="1172.96">array of every pixel in this file, so all you have to do is go through a subarray of</span> <span data-start="1172.96" data-end="1176.84">the pixels and then pick a color.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1176.84" data-end="1180.56">So I would just pick a color that's closest to the emoji in that blob.</span> <span data-start="1180.56" data-end="1187.07">And here I've done very bad things to the RGB and assumed it's linear  —  it's not.</span> <span data-start="1187.07" data-end="1190.97">So I'm just taking a linear distance  —  it's not correct.</span> <span data-start="1190.97" data-end="1191.97">It's kind of correct.</span> <span data-start="1191.97" data-end="1194.86">It's probably not the best emoji for that but I don't care, it's art.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1194.86" data-end="1196.53">I can get away with this.</span> <span data-start="1196.53" data-end="1202.03">So every single blob for this, I keep doing this and put the spans if the output.</span> <span data-start="1202.03" data-end="1212.34">So in the end, you get a giant pile of spans that contain the emoji that are assorted that</span> <span data-start="1212.34" data-end="1220.64">the colors in that image it's going to be warped because Slack doesn't use monospaced</span> <span data-start="1220.64" data-end="1221.72">fonts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1221.72" data-end="1225.53">So it's like work lemons but it's fine because we've made and you're trying to share that</span> <span data-start="1225.53" data-end="1230.98">with your friends which is exactly what you're trying to do in the first place.</span> <span data-start="1230.98" data-end="1237.24">So all of that was made with web components and because you can make web components you</span> <span data-start="1237.24" data-end="1243">should make like more awesome artsy web components like a WordArt component from, like, Windows</span> <span data-start="1243" data-end="1257.46">95, or Windows 97, I don't remember which of them, you have, like, a foreground emoji</span> <span data-start="1257.46" data-end="1260.04">and a background emoji and it says why your text.</span> <span data-start="1260.04" data-end="1262.53">Good news, my coworker implemented this.</span> <span data-start="1262.53" data-end="1268.091">So this is a custom element that I've made called an emoji picturing and you put your</span> <span data-start="1268.091" data-end="1272.24">emoji and text, and you make awesome things.</span> <span data-start="1272.24" data-end="1277.43">And because it's a web component, it's semantically expressive, and it was called Emoji Art, and</span> <span data-start="1277.43" data-end="1283.12">it's doing what it's supposed to do, and you don't need to know how it works because it's</span> <span data-start="1283.12" data-end="1284.51">scary.</span> <span data-start="1284.51" data-end="1291.91">So I want you to think of web components as apps because that's what they are but in particular</span> <span data-start="1291.91" data-end="1296.91">I want you to think of them as tools to make art and share art on the Internet because</span> <span data-start="1296.91" data-end="1298.72">that's what I really care about.</span> <span data-start="1298.72" data-end="1303.22">So do things, share things, tell people how to pixelate their face and put an emoji on</span> <span data-start="1303.22" data-end="1304.22">it.</span> </p>
