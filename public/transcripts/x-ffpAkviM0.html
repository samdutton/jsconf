<p><span data-start="42.03" data-end="46.96">I think they are technically fascinating but there's an incredible potential in these kind</span> <span data-start="46.96" data-end="52.069">of technologies that haven't been leveraged in the web, so that is what I pursue a lot</span> <span data-start="52.069" data-end="53.579">in my daily life.</span> <span data-start="53.579" data-end="60.299">I was one of the people who helped start the secure scuttlebutt project which is a secure</span> <span data-start="60.299" data-end="64.589">peer-to-peer network.</span> <span data-start="64.589" data-end="67.94">I spend my days now working on the Beaker browser.</span> <span data-start="67.94" data-end="73.58">It is an experimental peer-to-peer web browser.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="73.58" data-end="79.18">We want to see if it is possible to let users publish websites without having to use servers</span> <span data-start="79.18" data-end="80.72">at all.</span> <span data-start="80.72" data-end="85.6">We want to see if you could have a button perhaps if the browser, you can click that,</span> <span data-start="85.6" data-end="90.421">then public the site from your laptop or a mobile device, and then you don't have to</span> <span data-start="90.421" data-end="94.68">worry about operations and things are much easier for you.</span> <span data-start="94.68" data-end="104.98">Curious to hear how that works, you should listen to Tara Vancil's talk tonight.</span> <span data-start="104.98" data-end="110.22">What I'm going to be talking about is a little bit about animates us to work on this project,</span> <span data-start="110.22" data-end="115.17">why we care so much about this idea, and we think it can have a positive effect on the</span> <span data-start="115.17" data-end="116.45">web.</span> <span data-start="116.45" data-end="120.28">Now, we are huge advocate for the open web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.28" data-end="124.32">I think it's incredible that we have this shared platform that's not encumbered by patents</span> <span data-start="124.32" data-end="131.379">or licences, and it isn't owned by any one corps ratings, but lately the web has been</span> <span data-start="131.379" data-end="133.579">struggling with systemic problems.</span> <span data-start="133.579" data-end="139.409">Issues with things like bullying, harassment online, misinformation campaigns that affect</span> <span data-start="139.409" data-end="145.44">our elections, and infringement of personal privacy, and honestly, the list goes on.</span> <span data-start="145.44" data-end="151.15">Now, I think in a way, all of these systemic problems stem or have some kind of relationship</span> <span data-start="151.15" data-end="158.62">to one basic question, and that question is: who is in charge?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.62" data-end="163.319">I don't mean this in a petty sense like who happens to be the market leader from one moment</span> <span data-start="163.319" data-end="169.359">to another, but in a profound sense: who has the authority to govern or communities and</span> <span data-start="169.359" data-end="172.29">our applications, and our online lives?</span> <span data-start="172.29" data-end="176.2">More importantly than that, perhaps, what gives them that right to be the people that</span> <span data-start="176.2" data-end="179.209">govern our experiences?</span> <span data-start="179.209" data-end="183.81">On top of that, I think we also should understand what kind of rights we have as users.</span> <span data-start="183.81" data-end="186.249">What rights do we have to control the software we use?</span> <span data-start="186.249" data-end="190.62">What rights do we have to control the algorithms that affect our perception of the world.</span> <span data-start="190.62" data-end="194.84">What rights do we have to control the moderation policies that affect these issues that affect</span> <span data-start="194.84" data-end="196.599">us every day?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="196.599" data-end="200.639">And so, you can talk about political rights.</span> <span data-start="200.639" data-end="206.939">In fact, there's been amazing work with the GDPR, but there's something else, a kind of</span> <span data-start="206.939" data-end="211.499">right that emerges, I believe, specifically from the technical design of the web, and</span> <span data-start="211.499" data-end="214.33">the architectures of networks in general.</span> <span data-start="214.33" data-end="219.269">And this technical right is derived from what everybody is able to do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="219.269" data-end="223.01">So that is the right that we are going to be talking about here today.</span> <span data-start="223.01" data-end="226.93">Now, I think it is important that we go through some of the stuff that is the problem right</span> <span data-start="226.93" data-end="231.769">now which means we are going to have to go through some offensive content â€” I tried</span> <span data-start="231.769" data-end="232.889">to censor it a little bit.</span> <span data-start="232.889" data-end="236.03">It's kind of annoying.</span> <span data-start="236.03" data-end="237.83">Let's talk about harassment.</span> <span data-start="237.83" data-end="241.84">Well, mostly talk about Twitter, but Twitter of course is not the only community that has</span> <span data-start="241.84" data-end="242.87">this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.87" data-end="246.989">Here is Susan Fowler talking about anti-Semitism filling her notifications.</span> <span data-start="246.989" data-end="250.5">Lately, Jessica had a death threat.</span> <span data-start="250.5" data-end="257.73">She had to struggle a lit bit to get Twitter's moderation teams to take it seriously.</span> <span data-start="257.73" data-end="262.53">You don't have to go far to find this kind of stuff.</span> <span data-start="262.53" data-end="263.83">I don't think this is news to anybody.</span> <span data-start="263.83" data-end="266.89">The internet is full of trolls, right?</span> <span data-start="266.89" data-end="271.34">The running joke at this point is that Twitter is a cesspool.</span> <span data-start="271.34" data-end="275.69">Well, you could say that this is just how it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="275.69" data-end="279.9">We should develop a thick skin, and perhaps this kind of behaviour is just the cost of</span> <span data-start="279.9" data-end="282.42">free speech.</span> <span data-start="282.42" data-end="285.95">Perhaps that's the case, except that I'm beginning to believe that this kind of behaviour is</span> <span data-start="285.95" data-end="288.69">affecting our culture, and our political systems.</span> <span data-start="288.69" data-end="291.28">I don't think I'm the only one to think that.</span> <span data-start="291.28" data-end="296.22">At the end of last year, Reid Hoffman weighed in on this issue, how he would save the problems</span> <span data-start="296.22" data-end="301.62">of hate speech, abuse on our social media platforms.</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="305.84">Reid Hoffman is the co-founder of LinkedIn.</span> <span data-start="305.84" data-end="312.07">In this interview, he gave his prescription, and it was this: these are private businesses.</span> <span data-start="312.07" data-end="315.67">All these social media platforms are private businesses, and they can set policies about</span> <span data-start="315.67" data-end="321.29">what kind of behaviour they expect from their users, from their participants on the platform.</span> <span data-start="321.29" data-end="325.85">The metaphor he uses it's like a hotel or restaurant.</span> <span data-start="325.85" data-end="329">You can set a policy, no shirt, no service.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="329" data-end="331.24">The same thing here.</span> <span data-start="331.24" data-end="337.65">Project a more opinionated view about what kind of speech is permissible on your platform.</span> <span data-start="337.65" data-end="339.07">That's what he is putting out.</span> <span data-start="339.07" data-end="343.75">Now, to some degree, I think he has a fair point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="343.75" data-end="350.44">But what he is suggesting really highlights what I think is kind of a constant probably</span> <span data-start="350.44" data-end="351.75">with how the web works.</span> <span data-start="351.75" data-end="356.92">It kind of highlights how we are stuck between a rock and a hard place on this matter.</span> <span data-start="356.92" data-end="362.49">Because, on the one hand, I'm not the sort of person who is animated by concerns about</span> <span data-start="362.49" data-end="364.27">censorship.</span> </p>
