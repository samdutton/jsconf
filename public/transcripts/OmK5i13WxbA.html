data-end="286.58">we don't we don't apply drawing</span> <span data-start="286.58" data-end="291.25">instructions on on the constructor I</span> <span data-start="291.25" data-end="295.19">will tell about it right now and let's</span> <span data-start="295.19" data-end="298.04">really let's I think it's one of the</span> <span data-start="298.04" data-end="302.99">smallest bonsai scripts possible and in</span> <span data-start="302.99" data-end="304.7">your movie in your bonsai movie you have</span> <span data-start="304.7" data-end="306.95">you have a global stage object and</span> <span data-start="306.95" data-end="311.12">whatever you add to the stage this yeah</span> <span data-start="311.12" data-end="313.49">it's supposed to be drawn on your screen</span> <span data-start="313.49" data-end="320.33">and and you a new movie runs in on</span> <span data-start="320.33" data-end="323.75">sandbox so what does that mean and that</span> <span data-start="323.75" data-end="325.49">means that yes you have actually no</span> <span data-start="325.49" data-end="327.95">access to the rest of your website you</span> <span data-start="327.95" data-end="332.06">don't have access to the dumb but it</span> <span data-start="332.06" data-end="335.41">allows us to take your movie and run it</span> <span data-start="335.41" data-end="337.97">nearly wherever we want so for example</span> <span data-start="337.97" data-end="341.18">an iframe of course okay that's that's</span> <span data-start="341.18" data-end="343.28">fair enough but also in a bad worker for</span> <span data-start="343.28" data-end="348.02">example so and of course on the server</span> <span data-start="348.02" data-end="351.169">but would be possible as well so yes we</span> <span data-start="351.169" data-end="355.039">can execute your movie in these three</span> <span data-start="355.039" data-end="358.78">environments and and still able to draw</span> <span data-start="358.78" data-end="361.55">your drawing instructions to the screen</span> <span data-start="361.55" data-end="365">and there is a way to communicate</span> <span data-start="365" data-end="368.12">between your website which I call the</span> <span data-start="368.12" data-end="372.919">main thread and you your bonsai code</span> <span data-start="372.919" data-end="375.02">there's API for that and I will show you</span> <span data-start="375.02" data-end="378.89">that a little bit later first of all I</span> <span data-start="378.89" data-end="383.36">thought okay how can I show API so let's</span> <span data-start="383.36" data-end="386.09">play pong okay I create a little game</span> <span data-start="386.09" data-end="389.36">and I'm by there to show you the API if</span> <span data-start="389.36" data-end="393.169">bonsai first of all I thought okay we</span> <span data-start="393.169" data-end="395.36">need a background image of course the</span> <span data-start="395.36" data-end="398.72">rejection logo and so we simply create</span> <span data-start="398.72" data-end="401.03">in your bitmap and yeah we add it to the</span> <span data-start="401.03" data-end="404.27">stage and that and that's it so what's</span> <span data-start="404.27" data-end="405.289">next</span> <span data-start="405.289" data-end="407.18">okay so we want to put it in the</span> <span data-start="407.18" data-end="410.029">background so I decided to apply filters</span> <span data-start="410.029" data-end="412.389">wellness opacity the other one is blur</span> <span data-start="412.389" data-end="416.059">the rest remains the same we also have</span> <span data-start="416.059" data-end="418.729">other filters as well for example</span> <span data-start="418.729" data-end="424.669">grayscale or CPR or or invert there are</span> <span data-start="424.669" data-end="429.439">others as well please have a look at the</span> <span data-start="429.439" data-end="433.039">the docs and boxed up bonsly just a</span> <span data-start="433.039" data-end="436.399">torque and yeah you can draw simple</span> <span data-start="436.399" data-end="440.539">shapes I use the wrecked API to draw the</span> <span data-start="440.539" data-end="444.68">pedals for pond and circle API to draw</span> <span data-start="444.68" data-end="449.93">the ball fill them there are more shapes</span> <span data-start="449.93" data-end="452.479">then what let's actually convenient API</span> <span data-start="452.479" data-end="456.77">right so star ellipse polygon we can we</span> <span data-start="456.77" data-end="459.199">could add more you as a user can add</span> <span data-start="459.199" data-end="464.83">more wild plugins the a generic object</span> <span data-start="464.83" data-end="469.389">for drawing shapes path is a path object</span> <span data-start="469.389" data-end="471.86">the cool thing about the path object is</span> <span data-start="471.86" data-end="478.699">it takes SVG like syntax and and</span> <span data-start="478.699" data-end="480.62">something you know from the canvas API</span> <span data-start="480.62" data-end="483.409">the PostScript like operators so what</span> <span data-start="483.409" data-end="484.899">does it mean it means you can actually</span> <span data-start="484.899" data-end="489.649">copy and paste your existing shapes to</span> <span data-start="489.649" data-end="492.83">the path and pass it to the path object</span> <span data-start="492.83" data-end="502.49">and it is supposed to work okay yeah as</span> <span data-start="502.49" data-end="506.749">there's a Calliope I of course but it's</span> <span data-start="506.749" data-end="512.659">kind of rich and and it turns out it</span> <span data-start="512.659" data-end="514.37">solves a communication problem between</span> <span data-start="514.37" data-end="518.959">the designer and the developer and by</span> <span data-start="518.959" data-end="521.06">that I mean in South iterations when a</span> <span data-start="521.06" data-end="523.13">designer says can you please take the</span> <span data-start="523.13" data-end="524.63">following color and in develop a service</span> <span data-start="524.63" data-end="528.29">okay cool I take it and he says oh well</span> <span data-start="528.29" data-end="530.449">it's not exactly color one can you</span> <span data-start="530.449" data-end="533.149">please make a little bit darker okay now</span> <span data-start="533.149" data-end="534.949">that you've all possess will convene</span> <span data-start="534.949" data-end="537.74">please just give them the color and yeah</span> <span data-start="537.74" data-end="538.95">we can help</span> <span data-start="538.95" data-end="543.69">we have lighter darker and midpoint hey</span> <span data-start="543.69" data-end="545.61">what about midpoint and if you just</span> <span data-start="545.61" data-end="549.14">can't agree you can also randomized</span> <span data-start="549.14" data-end="554.13">that's still possible and that is very</span> <span data-start="554.13" data-end="557.7">handy especially for gradients because</span> <span data-start="557.7" data-end="560.22">you now can say okay my first call is</span> <span data-start="560.22" data-end="564.48">blue my second color is also blue but a</span> <span data-start="564.48" data-end="567.09">little bit darker and that makes a</span> <span data-start="567.09" data-end="569.55">beautiful gradient I think I applied</span> <span data-start="569.55" data-end="575.64">those gradients on the pedals bonds are</span> <span data-start="575.64" data-end="583.25">also supports gradients okay utter is</span> <span data-start="583.25" data-end="586.8">the function we need to change any kind</span> <span data-start="586.8" data-end="589.95">of attributes so for example to change</span> <span data-start="589.95" data-end="597.69">the position we take x x and y it was</span> <span data-start="597.69" data-end="599.49">also responsible for any other</span> <span data-start="599.49" data-end="605.52">transformations like scale or rotate and</span> <span data-start="605.52" data-end="610.83">it is also responsible for any styles</span> <span data-start="610.83" data-end="616.23">like colors for example and yep pointing</span> <span data-start="616.23" data-end="622.04">events are built in so that means we</span> <span data-start="622.04" data-end="625.29">abstracted the point events for touch</span> <span data-start="625.29" data-end="631.79">devices and for i say most devices and</span> <span data-start="631.79" data-end="635.7">that should work and it works yep so you</span> <span data-start="635.7" data-end="639.45">listen to the stage the stage is is that</span> <span data-start="639.45" data-end="642.45">what is strong so we abstracted that by</span> <span data-start="642.45" data-end="645.87">by the word stage and then you can</span> <span data-start="645.87" data-end="647.58">listen to those events like pointer you</span> <span data-start="647.58" data-end="654.09">like pointer move just to be able to</span> <span data-start="654.09" data-end="656.61">show you the animation especially</span> <span data-start="656.61" data-end="658.89">nonlinear animations I decided to</span> <span data-start="658.89" data-end="660.84">animate the ball so we never read the</span> <span data-start="660.84" data-end="665.1">game start the ball is like this new you</span> <span data-start="665.1" data-end="670.26">cool so the API looks may be familiar to</span> <span data-start="670.26" data-end="671.769">most of you because</span> <span data-start="671.769" data-end="673.809">is nothing new also used by other</span> <span data-start="673.809" data-end="676.499">graphic libraries so you have a duration</span> <span data-start="676.499" data-end="679.779">you pass all you attributes you want to</span> <span data-start="679.779" data-end="683.41">animate and have some options to also</span> <span data-start="683.41" data-end="687.069">change easing and end stuff we also have</span> <span data-start="687.069" data-end="689.739">you frame animations that's nothing else</span> <span data-start="689.739" data-end="692.589">it's it's just animation where you can</span> <span data-start="692.589" data-end="695.319">decide to change the attribute at a</span> <span data-start="695.319" data-end="698.769">certain time but it's still all about</span> <span data-start="698.769" data-end="700.929">changing attributes and this is really</span> <span data-start="700.929" data-end="703.48">just convenient API it's what we do</span> <span data-start="703.48" data-end="705.91">inside is we change an attribute which</span> <span data-start="705.91" data-end="708.399">is path so what you can do with more</span> <span data-start="708.399" data-end="711.309">tools actually you can switch from Earth</span> <span data-start="711.309" data-end="720.549">to ball by mopping all the shapes yep</span> <span data-start="720.549" data-end="722.649">this is this is a the abstraction layer</span> <span data-start="722.649" data-end="725.579">of the timeout or interval or</span> <span data-start="725.579" data-end="728.35">requestanimationframe you can listen on</span> <span data-start="728.35" data-end="733.509">the tick you can listen and a tick event</span> <span data-start="733.509" data-end="737.589">and and place all your business logic</span> <span data-start="737.589" data-end="740.889">within that callback for example yeah I</span> <span data-start="740.889" data-end="744.249">decided to write a plug-in and now we</span> <span data-start="744.249" data-end="749.049">have walls and the ball yeah I think we</span> <span data-start="749.049" data-end="752.709">can you can play now right so I will do</span> <span data-start="752.709" data-end="759.009">that just to proof it's possible yeah</span> <span data-start="759.009" data-end="765.48">okay go um thank you very much</span> <span data-start="765.49" data-end="768.49">so I think it's much more fun if you</span> <span data-start="768.49" data-end="771.19">have if we would have sound so um the</span> <span data-start="771.19" data-end="773.41">thing is you you create new sound and</span> <span data-start="773.41" data-end="777.149">you edit tools to the stage as if it</span> <span data-start="777.149" data-end="780.01">should be drawn so that's the way we do</span> <span data-start="780.01" data-end="781.66">it and then when it's when it's there</span> <span data-start="781.66" data-end="784">and you can listen on the call back like</span> <span data-start="784" data-end="787.06">load it's alcoholic and then you okay</span> <span data-start="787.06" data-end="789.76">it's available and you can play pause</span> <span data-start="789.76" data-end="793.06">and play whatever you want
