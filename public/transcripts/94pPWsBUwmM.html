<span data-start="666.37" data-end="668.67">far everything is close to the screen</span> <span data-start="668.67" data-end="671.32">but we got some middleware and a lot of</span> <span

data-end="689.47">however you know it's all still C++ but</span> <span data-start="689.47" data-end="691.03">let's take a look at what these cameras</span> <span data-start="691.03" data-end="694.18">do first so if you were talking about a</span> <span data-start="694.18" data-end="698.29">normal web camera playstation I they'll</span> <span data-start="698.29" data-end="700.27">typically use edge detection so if you</span> <span data-start="700.27" data-end="702.04">go to photoshop you can take a look at</span> <span data-start="702.04" data-end="704.26">you can use edge detection on a photo</span> <span data-start="704.26" data-end="705.91">and you can get the edges and that's</span> <span data-start="705.91" data-end="707.74">kind of how these to my understanding</span> <span data-start="707.74" data-end="709.66">that's kind of how these places you know</span> <span data-start="709.66" data-end="712.54">they'll they'll do gestures and object</span> <span data-start="712.54" data-end="713.77">tracking and whatnot they'll get the</span> <span data-start="713.77" data-end="719.92">edges and work from there so but an

data-end="734.89">farther away and you know behind the</span> <span data-start="734.89" data-end="736.54">scenes if you put on infrared goggles</span> <span data-start="736.54" data-end="739.33">you can see tons of beams shooting out</span> <span data-start="739.33" data-end="742.15">at people and that's how they the beams</span> <span data-start="742.15" data-end="743.77">will shoot out at

that's</span> <span data-start="748.51" data-end="750.91">why that's why I like in this slide you</span> <span data-start="750.91" data-end="753.49">know it's not very fine-tuned it's kind</span> <span data-start="753.49" data-end="756.16">of sketchy it's kind of blurry so that's</span> <span data-start="756.16" data-end="757.48">that's that's what's going on there</span> <span data-start="757.48" data-end="759.91">because these aren't very small infrared</span> <span data-start="759.91" data-end="761.44">beams so there's not they're not very</span> <span data-start="761.44" data-end="763.54">fine-tuned for performance here but it</span> <span data-start="763.54" data-end="765.64">still works because you can interpret</span> <span data-start="765.64" data-end="767.65">that depth stream get you know my hand</span> <span data-start="767.65" data-end="768.649">is over here my head</span> <span data-start="768.649" data-end="772.22">over here my torso
