<p><span data-start="154.319" data-end="157.359">HTTP requests right all our hacks are</span> <span data-start="157.359" data-end="162.4">based around this so currently like</span> <span data-start="162.4" data-end="165.73">websites are like this and we want it to</span> <span data-start="165.73" data-end="168.519">be more like turbo right because what is</span> <span data-start="168.519" data-end="170.44">important is for it to be like super</span> <span data-start="170.44" data-end="176.379">fast so currently all of us are using</span> <span data-start="176.379" data-end="180.489">HTTP 1.1 and we are using it but instead</span> <span data-start="180.489" data-end="182.2">of like fixing what's wrong we're using</span> <span data-start="182.2" data-end="184.959">a lot of workarounds so let's go through</span> <span data-start="184.959" data-end="189.909">them first we have sprinting so this is</span> <span data-start="189.909" data-end="192.79">like really bad right it's like putting</span> <span data-start="192.79" data-end="195.37">images together in order to select just</span> <span data-start="195.37" data-end="198.31">one so it's really bad for caching it's</span> <span data-start="198.31" data-end="200.049">really bad when you need to change one</span> <span data-start="200.049" data-end="203.319">it's really bad to access it but still</span> <span data-start="203.319" data-end="209.53">it improve the speed of the website then</span> <span data-start="209.53" data-end="213.97">we have this horrible line which doesn't</span> <span data-start="213.97" data-end="216.4">look like anything you cannot even say</span> <span data-start="216.4" data-end="219.549">what this image is about so it's like</span> <span data-start="219.549" data-end="221.979">super bad but still even like Facebook</span> <span data-start="221.979" data-end="223.84">use it to cook to their website so they</span> <span data-start="223.84" data-end="227.769">must be a reason we also have in lining</span> <span data-start="227.769" data-end="230.379">which is you all know it like really bad</span> <span data-start="230.379" data-end="234.9">but we still use it for some cases and</span> <span data-start="234.9" data-end="236.829">another thing that we have is</span> <span data-start="236.829" data-end="239.199">concatenation okay it's like we have all</span> <span data-start="239.199" data-end="241.93">this javascript file all the CSS file</span> <span data-start="241.93" data-end="244.239">and after we put them all together in</span> <span data-start="244.239" data-end="246.639">order to reduce the number of HTTP</span> <span data-start="246.639" data-end="249.22">requests and we're using a lot of tools</span> <span data-start="249.22" data-end="252.579">in order to make it like all together</span> <span data-start="252.579" data-end="254.979">but the thing is that when you think</span> <span data-start="254.979" data-end="257.229">about it it's like when you download one</span> <span data-start="257.229" data-end="259.269">page you need to download the whole</span> <span data-start="259.269" data-end="262.57">website coding right so it's not really</span> <span data-start="262.57" data-end="264.52">efficient and when you think about</span> <span data-start="264.52" data-end="265.49">caching it's like</span> <span data-start="265.49" data-end="267.979">you update just one line of code you</span> <span data-start="267.979" data-end="271.099">need to refresh everything so actually</span> <span data-start="271.099" data-end="276.74">we're not using like what HTTP really</span> <span data-start="276.74" data-end="279.74">have to offer always TCP have to offer</span> <span data-start="279.74" data-end="283.25">as well it's really inefficient and when</span> <span data-start="283.25" data-end="286.55">we learn to code even as learning it's</span> <span data-start="286.55" data-end="289.099">like okay you learn to do this so it's</span> <span data-start="289.099" data-end="291.139">part of web development all these</span> <span data-start="291.139" data-end="295.94">workarounds then we have Charlotte so</span> <span data-start="295.94" data-end="298.61">basically with HTTP is like we're going</span> <span data-start="298.61" data-end="300.8">to limit the number of requests</span> <span data-start="300.8" data-end="304.099">connection that you can do but as it's</span> <span data-start="304.099" data-end="306.949">not fast enough we increase the number</span> <span data-start="306.949" data-end="310.31">of hosts so everything that we do is</span> <span data-start="310.31" data-end="313.13">just hacks and when you're looking at</span> <span data-start="313.13" data-end="316.069">the data which is the other graph the</span> <span data-start="316.069" data-end="319.039">green one that you see is that all the</span> <span data-start="319.039" data-end="320.99">unnecessary data that you are actually</span> <span data-start="320.99" data-end="324.08">downloaded to websites because you want</span> <span data-start="324.08" data-end="326.389">to make it faster so it's not also</span> <span data-start="326.389" data-end="328.34">server friendly because you're using a</span> <span data-start="328.34" data-end="330.83">lot of them with that you actually don't</span> <span data-start="330.83" data-end="336.08">need so yeah when you think about it</span> <span data-start="336.08" data-end="341.389">it's bad it's just super bad so what can</span> <span data-start="341.389" data-end="346.449">we do so they said okay let's fix HTTP</span> <span data-start="346.449" data-end="349.31">so they're what they're trying to do is</span> <span data-start="349.31" data-end="355.34">to make a protocol that is rdt sensitive</span> <span data-start="355.34" data-end="358.099">less already sensitive obviously and</span> <span data-start="358.099" data-end="362.229">also to fix a head of line blocking and</span> <span data-start="362.229" data-end="365.33">to stop the needs to making that many</span> <span data-start="365.33" data-end="370.099">requests and also to keep everything</span> <span data-start="370.099" data-end="373.25">because obviously as HTTP is the most</span> <span data-start="373.25" data-end="376.25">used protocol they cannot change it and</span> <span data-start="376.25" data-end="378.289">change the way it works right it's more</span> <span data-start="378.289" data-end="380.03">about changing how it proceeds the data</span> <span data-start="380.03" data-end="382.25">because we need to keep like the same</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="382.25" data-end="384.68">API the same everything the same URL</span> <span data-start="384.68" data-end="387.319">like nothing needs to change for the</span> <span data-start="387.319" data-end="389.63">user it's just for the web developers</span> <span data-start="389.63" data-end="396.68">that it needs to change so 2015 16 years</span> <span data-start="396.68" data-end="397.65">later</span> <span data-start="397.65" data-end="402.08">welcome to http too so what is it about</span> <span data-start="402.08" data-end="406.46">so who is behind basically it's like the</span> <span data-start="406.46" data-end="412.38">IETF which is HTTP beast group so a lot</span> <span data-start="412.38" data-end="414.389">of developer and other type of people</span> <span data-start="414.389" data-end="417.889">and where does HTTP to come from</span> <span data-start="417.889" data-end="421.949">actually in 2012 Google decided to</span> <span data-start="421.949" data-end="424.5">relieve speedy so speedy was a way to</span> <span data-start="424.5" data-end="429.06">download like faster and it got actually</span> <span data-start="429.06" data-end="433.169">a lot of traction so the IETF decided to</span> <span data-start="433.169" data-end="437.22">base HTTP two on speedy but it's not</span> <span data-start="437.22" data-end="439.229">done by like Google anymore it's really</span> <span data-start="439.229" data-end="441.03">independent because people like kind of</span> <span data-start="441.03" data-end="445.56">worried about this and in may 2015</span> <span data-start="445.56" data-end="449.729">finally easy RFC was released RFC is</span> <span data-start="449.729" data-end="451.229">kind of a weird word because it means</span> <span data-start="451.229" data-end="453.599">requests for comments but actually it's</span> <span data-start="453.599" data-end="455.88">already released so I find it kind of</span> <span data-start="455.88" data-end="459.81">strange and speedy is actually disabled</span> <span data-start="459.81" data-end="465.24">now so you cannot use it anymore so what</span> <span data-start="465.24" data-end="471.3">is HTTP to HTTPS a binary protocol so at</span> <span data-start="471.3" data-end="473.34">the web developer you might find it</span> <span data-start="473.34" data-end="475.05">really useful that it's only text</span> <span data-start="475.05" data-end="477.63">because it's really easy to check all</span> <span data-start="477.63" data-end="479.52">the answers and everything but when you</span> <span data-start="479.52" data-end="481.53">think about it the fact that it's going</span> <span data-start="481.53" data-end="483.81">to be binary make it's more compact and</span> <span data-start="483.81" data-end="488.729">efficient and it also prevent from like</span> <span data-start="488.729" data-end="493.38">crime attacks on the websites so that's</span> <span data-start="493.38" data-end="496.199">actually good and it reduces also all</span> <span data-start="496.199" data-end="498.93">the errors due to the text that it can</span> <span data-start="498.93" data-end="500.4">brings because you have a lot of space</span> <span data-start="500.4" data-end="502.47">coma and all these kind of things so</span> <span data-start="502.47" data-end="504.87">it's actually difficult to parse and to</span> <span data-start="504.87" data-end="507.15">know like when it ends and when it</span> <span data-start="507.15" data-end="509.849">finish so with the binary it's going to</span> <span data-start="509.849" data-end="514.62">be more efficient now we are talking</span> <span data-start="514.62" data-end="517.68">about header compression when you're</span> <span data-start="517.68" data-end="519.659">looking at the header that you have</span> <span data-start="519.659" data-end="521.55">actually you have a lot of redundant</span> <span data-start="521.55" data-end="526.13">data so now you have edge back and this</span> <span data-start="526.13" data-end="529.55">will actually reduce the header for like</span> <span data-start="529.55" data-end="532.07">sixty six percent which is really huge</span> <span data-start="532.07" data-end="534.53">because now you don't have any</span> <span data-start="534.53" data-end="538.22">compression at all so it's actually very</span> <span data-start="538.22" data-end="541.88">good so and as you can see it's even</span> <span data-start="541.88" data-end="543.86">better than than speedy so it's really</span> <span data-start="543.86" data-end="546.08">based on it but they really improve it</span> <span data-start="546.08" data-end="549.44">after it like zoom one or two years have</span> <span data-start="549.44" data-end="553.91">been working on top of it so now also</span> <span data-start="553.91" data-end="556.67">you're going to have priorities in the</span> <span data-start="556.67" data-end="561.05">requests using weights and dependency so</span> <span data-start="561.05" data-end="564.35">basically you're requesting for websites</span> <span data-start="564.35" data-end="566.78">what it can do is that it can identify</span> <span data-start="566.78" data-end="570.08">where you are on the dome and depending</span> <span data-start="570.08" data-end="572.39">on where you are it requesting priority</span> <span data-start="572.39" data-end="576.17">what you can see so basically it's going</span> <span data-start="576.17" data-end="579.38">to ask for HTML first then CSS sends the</span> <span data-start="579.38" data-end="582.53">images and you can put weights on each</span> <span data-start="582.53" data-end="584.81">of these requests and based on this</span> <span data-start="584.81" data-end="587.27">you're going to receive them in advance</span> <span data-start="587.27" data-end="590.63">and this will also remove the head of</span> <span data-start="590.63" data-end="593.54">line blocking because you won't need to</span> <span data-start="593.54" data-end="596">wait for the request to be finished in</span> <span data-start="596" data-end="598.46">order to have the rest basically it's</span> <span data-start="598.46" data-end="603.8">like you you're ordering something and</span> <span data-start="603.8" data-end="607.1">it gets much much faster and also the</span> <span data-start="607.1" data-end="610.76">thing is that you can also stop the</span> <span data-start="610.76" data-end="615.32">request even when you have it so now you</span> <span data-start="615.32" data-end="616.76">have something that is actually very</span> <span data-start="616.76" data-end="620.48">cool which is the server push it's like</span> <span data-start="620.48" data-end="623.57">you at you ask your server for requests</span> <span data-start="623.57" data-end="626.63">and then the server will anticipate what</span> <span data-start="626.63" data-end="628.4">you need afterwards and it will give it</span> <span data-start="628.4" data-end="630.86">to you so when you think about an</span> <span data-start="630.86" data-end="632.99">analogy it's like imagine you're in a</span> <span data-start="632.99" data-end="635.6">restaurant okay so yours a brother and</span> <span data-start="635.6" data-end="640.13">then the kitchen is the server and then</span> <span data-start="640.13" data-end="642.71">your protocol are the wetter so in the</span> <span data-start="642.71" data-end="644.78">first version of HTTP you would order a</span> <span data-start="644.78" data-end="646.19">sandwich and then you will have your</span> <span data-start="646.19" data-end="648.8">waiter com go to the kitchen come back</span> <span data-start="648.8" data-end="650.84">with the bread go to the kitchen come</span> <span data-start="650.84" data-end="653.18">back with a ham and then you know with</span> <span data-start="653.18" data-end="655.39">the cheese and everything then you have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="655.39" data-end="657.18">HTTP 1.1</span> <span data-start="657.18" data-end="659.01">and then instead of having like one</span> <span data-start="659.01" data-end="661.98">wetter you could have for waiters okay</span> <span data-start="661.98" data-end="664.8">so each one of them will go and come</span> <span data-start="664.8" data-end="666.63">with something and they will stay at</span> <span data-start="666.63" data-end="668.97">your table until everything is there</span> <span data-start="668.97" data-end="670.86">when you think about like the number of</span> <span data-start="670.86" data-end="672.06">weathers you need that's not very</span> <span data-start="672.06" data-end="676.53">efficient so now with HTTP two it's like</span> <span data-start="676.53" data-end="678.69">you asked for a sandwich you have one</span> <span data-start="678.69" data-end="680.37">waiter because you only have one</span> <span data-start="680.37" data-end="682.59">connection it goes to the kitchen she</span> <span data-start="682.59" data-end="684.54">comes back with your sandwich and she</span> <span data-start="684.54" data-end="687.51">even brings you the coffee it's awesome</span> <span data-start="687.51" data-end="690.33">right and you can even say no I don't</span> <span data-start="690.33" data-end="692.16">want the coffee and it's like you don't</span> <span data-start="692.16" data-end="695.37">have to pay for it so it's really really</span> <span data-start="695.37" data-end="702.12">powerful then you have multiplexing so</span> <span data-start="702.12" data-end="704.58">multiplexing is like this little train</span> <span data-start="704.58" data-end="707.7">but that you see so all the streams are</span> <span data-start="707.7" data-end="712.38">divided into like headers and data so</span> <span data-start="712.38" data-end="715.08">you send the streams and when it comes</span> <span data-start="715.08" data-end="716.76">back it comes it can come back in</span> <span data-start="716.76" data-end="719.07">different order and your browser will</span> <span data-start="719.07" data-end="722.22">know where to put it and to reassemble</span> <span data-start="722.22" data-end="725.25">dips so it's great because if something</span> <span data-start="725.25" data-end="727.38">is blocking or is taking more bands with</span> <span data-start="727.38" data-end="729.87">it can actually get the other one in</span> <span data-start="729.87" data-end="732.45">priority so that's all the problem that</span> <span data-start="732.45" data-end="738.3">we use to have with HTTP 1.1 so in terms</span> <span data-start="738.3" data-end="741.27">of implementation actually most of us</span> <span data-start="741.27" data-end="744">didn't know it but it's already there in</span> <span data-start="744" data-end="746.69">terms of browser and in terms of server</span> <span data-start="746.69" data-end="751.19">for Firefox and Chrome it's actually</span> <span data-start="751.19" data-end="754.89">enabled by default so you might already</span> <span data-start="754.89" data-end="757.92">use it without knowing to and in terms</span> <span data-start="757.92" data-end="759.78">of server a lot of them are supporting</span> <span data-start="759.78" data-end="764.34">it so when you look at the web actually</span> <span data-start="764.34" data-end="766.41">you have more requests that have been</span> <span data-start="766.41" data-end="769.68">that are done in HTTP to right now</span> <span data-start="769.68" data-end="773.04">rather than HTTP 1.0 so it's getting</span> <span data-start="773.04" data-end="779.49">there really fast so basically for</span> <span data-start="779.49" data-end="782.73">normal humans it's really good it's</span> <span data-start="782.73" data-end="785.31">going to be faster which means a better</span> <span data-start="785.31" data-end="786.36">user experience</span> <span data-start="786.36" data-end="789.029">which means like more attention on your</span> <span data-start="789.029" data-end="791.04">website you know everything that comes</span> <span data-start="791.04" data-end="793.47">with it everything that we want and for</span> <span data-start="793.47" data-end="796.079">developers that's going to change a</span> <span data-start="796.079" data-end="798.45">little bit first of all we'll need to</span> <span data-start="798.45" data-end="800.79">like unlearn everything that we've</span> <span data-start="800.79" data-end="802.649">learned to do we will need to rebuild</span> <span data-start="802.649" data-end="804.57">our website to change how it's made to</span> <span data-start="804.57" data-end="806.79">make it more functional because actually</span> <span data-start="806.79" data-end="808.829">the thing is that all the hacks that</span> <span data-start="808.829" data-end="811.529">we've been doing when you're using HTTP</span> <span data-start="811.529" data-end="815.04">two it's actually slowing it so you</span> <span data-start="815.04" data-end="817.32">actually really need to remove it and to</span> <span data-start="817.32" data-end="820.2">stop all this concatenation sharding and</span> <span data-start="820.2" data-end="823.38">everything that we say before so you</span> <span data-start="823.38" data-end="827.31">really need to remove it and maybe what</span> <span data-start="827.31" data-end="829.589">we will need to do is to have a special</span> <span data-start="829.589" data-end="832.05">request for HTTP one and a special one</span> <span data-start="832.05" data-end="836.579">for HTTP to the thing is that HTTP two</span> <span data-start="836.579" data-end="839.13">works like a different language what</span> <span data-start="839.13" data-end="840.839">will happen it's like the server will</span> <span data-start="840.839" data-end="842.85">come back and say hey do you speak HTTP</span> <span data-start="842.85" data-end="845.339">two and if the browser saying no then it</span> <span data-start="845.339" data-end="848.22">will just give you the default one so</span> <span data-start="848.22" data-end="850.769">actually you don't really need to notice</span> <span data-start="850.769" data-end="860.19">it so go and explore HTTP to thank you</span> <span data-start="860.19" data-end="867.75">very much hey my name is Jacques dodgy</span> <span data-start="867.75" data-end="869.82">so i have a question like when browser</span> <span data-start="869.82" data-end="872.37">makes a request so you say the server</span> <span data-start="872.37" data-end="875.82">will anticipate and even if i ask for a</span> <span data-start="875.82" data-end="877.8">sangwich it will bring me a coffee right</span> <span data-start="877.8" data-end="881.459">so how it is guessing that what else I</span> <span data-start="881.459" data-end="884.88">might require with that request how is</span> <span data-start="884.88" data-end="887.22">it guessing that it's a HTTP to know how</span> <span data-start="887.22" data-end="891.089">it is give like if I asked for HTML but</span> <span data-start="891.089" data-end="893.61">you said that it might anticipate that I</span> <span data-start="893.61" data-end="896.19">might require the CSS file as well and</span> <span data-start="896.19" data-end="898.829">it will send the CSS together yeah it</span> <span data-start="898.829" data-end="901.5">will so how it will guess that what else</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="901.5" data-end="903.6">I require because you will set it up</span> <span data-start="903.6" data-end="905.13">actually you will have all your</span> <span data-start="905.13" data-end="907.11">priorities and everything so the circle</span> <span data-start="907.11" data-end="908.73">will know so that's how it's going to be</span> <span data-start="908.73" data-end="911.01">able to anticipate it so you kind of</span> <span data-start="911.01" data-end="913.74">need to configure it how much is</span> <span data-start="913.74" data-end="915.279">deployed now and what</span> <span data-start="915.279" data-end="917.41">that kind of time frame for uptake do</span> <span data-start="917.41" data-end="920.889">you think so basically in in terms of</span> <span data-start="920.889" data-end="924.85">browser I think about sixty percent of</span> <span data-start="924.85" data-end="928.959">the bra so supported right now and in</span> <span data-start="928.959" data-end="932.61">terms of deployment among the top ten</span> <span data-start="932.61" data-end="936.399">thousand websites it's supported around</span> <span data-start="936.399" data-end="939.749">I think it's fifteen or twenty percent</span> <span data-start="939.749" data-end="945.55">so it's actually pretty big yeah you say</span> <span data-start="945.55" data-end="947.92">that we need to remove some of the hacks</span> <span data-start="947.92" data-end="950.829">that we're executing today to speed up</span> <span data-start="950.829" data-end="953.199">things in HTTP one can you give some</span> <span data-start="953.199" data-end="955.749">specific examples of the actual hacks</span> <span data-start="955.749" data-end="958.149">that that you would expect us to remove</span> <span data-start="958.149" data-end="960.009">all the ones that I said at the</span> <span data-start="960.009" data-end="961.12">beginning it's Friday like</span> <span data-start="961.12" data-end="963.069">congratulations browserify anymore don't</span> <span data-start="963.069" data-end="965.8">use concatenation yeah yes so so that's</span> <span data-start="965.8" data-end="967.779">where it comes like kind of complicated</span> <span data-start="967.779" data-end="969.819">because you also need to check on your</span> <span data-start="969.819" data-end="972.16">website if your user are using HTTP two</span> <span data-start="972.16" data-end="974.62">or HTTP one in order to kind of guess</span> <span data-start="974.62" data-end="975.999">which one you need to implement as well</span> <span data-start="975.999" data-end="977.74">right you need to run a test to see what</span> <span data-start="977.74" data-end="979.99">your users are are doing right now if</span> <span data-start="979.99" data-end="981.61">you're mainly implemented in China and</span> <span data-start="981.61" data-end="984.91">they are using IA for like old version</span> <span data-start="984.91" data-end="986.949">you obviously won't be implementing it</span> <span data-start="986.949" data-end="990.339">so I read a lot about the discussions</span> <span data-start="990.339" data-end="992.05">that's been going on is how do you</span> <span data-start="992.05" data-end="994.809">actually set up something how do you</span> <span data-start="994.809" data-end="997.3">load your project being able to respond</span> <span data-start="997.3" data-end="1000.12">in HTTP 1.1 with all the hacks that</span> <span data-start="1000.12" data-end="1002.279">we've been doing and how to upload it to</span> <span data-start="1002.279" data-end="1006.569">be able to do HTTP to and that's not</span> <span data-start="1006.569" data-end="1009.899">really clear gotcha okay when do you</span> <span data-start="1009.899" data-end="1012.149">think HTTP you will be like the major</span> <span data-start="1012.149" data-end="1015.319">thing and the way like a pacing 1.1</span> <span data-start="1015.319" data-end="1018.029">because of meeting at it's like not</span> <span data-start="1018.029" data-end="1020.91">supported by a lot of still not</span> <span data-start="1020.91" data-end="1024.569">supported by like tom cat oh yeah i</span> <span data-start="1024.569" data-end="1026.459">think there are a lot of developments to</span> <span data-start="1026.459" data-end="1028.079">be made but when you think about the</span> <span data-start="1028.079" data-end="1030.12">fact that it's only being released in</span> </p>
