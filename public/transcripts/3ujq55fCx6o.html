data-end="142.17">programming is that the syntax is</span> <span data-start="142.17" data-end="144.96">actually closer to what to the notation</span> <span data-start="144.96" data-end="147.57">that

data-end="171.87">practically well it's all functions</span> <span data-start="171.87" data-end="173.549">functions all the way down so your</span> <span data-start="173.549" data-end="176.069">program is running a function which runs</span> <span data-start="176.069" data-end="180.81">functions and that's it there is no</span> <span data-start="180.81" data-end="184.409">global states or no global variables so</span> <span data-start="184.409" data-end="186.9">obviously like all good JavaScript</span> <span data-start="186.9" data-end="188.73">programmers you'll northern say are we</span> <span data-start="188.73" data-end="190.59">don't use global variables that's very</span> <span data-start="190.59" data-end="194.28">bad except we kind of do because when we</span> <span data-start="194.28" data-end="196.709">use console or we use documents or we</span> <span data-start="196.709" data-end="198.659">use window we're obviously using</span> <span data-start="198.659" data-end="201.03">something that is not explicitly in the</span> <span data-start="201.03" data-end="206.639">context of our function really no side</span> <span data-start="206.639" data-end="209.51">effects so basically you're not</span> <span data-start="209.51" data-end="213.87">technically allowed to do a console log</span> <span data-start="213.87" data-end="215.37">in your function because that's like</span> <span data-start="215.37" data-end="218.25">kind of veering away from the like</span> <span data-start="218.25" data-end="220.53">straight path from input to output</span> <span data-start="220.53" data-end="222.359">switch your function is supposed to</span> <span data-start="222.359" data-end="228.75">follow and no destructive updates which</span> <span data-start="228.75" data-end="230.489">may prove to be the hardest thing to</span> <span data-start="230.489" data-end="234.06">work with because it means you cannot</span> <span data-start="234.06" data-end="239.43">change any variables I guess you can</span> <span data-start="239.43" data-end="243.979">return something different but yep</span> <span data-start="243.979" data-end="247.76">basically that's it so who can point out</span> <span data-start="247.76" data-end="252.56">what's not functional about this example</span> <span data-start="252.56" data-end="264.659">not good enough yes so the side effects</span> <span data-start="264.659" data-end="266.639">console.log is obviously wrong but also</span> <span data-start="266.639" data-end="269.34">the facts that in the say gender</span> <span data-start="269.34" data-end="274.71">function you're using data that comes</span> <span data-start="274.71" data-end="278.25">from outside your function so you</span> <span data-start="278.25" data-end="279.979">shouldn't actually be using that</span> <span data-start="279.979" data-end="282.21">obviously this is not</span> <span data-start="282.21" data-end="287.19">a functional programming so some</span> <span data-start="287.19" data-end="293.13">patterns so actually javascript is</span> <span data-start="293.13" data-end="296.449">pretty good because it's got obviously</span> <span data-start="296.449" data-end="298.65">functions as first orders the</span> <span data-start="298.65" data-end="301.41">first-class citizens and so you can</span> <span data-start="301.41" data-end="302.699">create them and pass them around and</span> <span data-start="302.699" data-end="305.19">everything so everyone uses higher-order</span> <span data-start="305.19" data-end="306.93">functions whether they realize it or not</span> <span data-start="306.93" data-end="309.78">one form of higher order function is</span> <span data-start="309.78" data-end="314.9">taking a function as arguments and</span> <span data-start="314.9" data-end="321.539">obviously we'll do that callbacks of any</span> <span data-start="321.539" data-end="324.3">kind event handlers this is all taking</span> <span data-start="324.3" data-end="329.28">functions as arguments then there's</span> <span data-start="329.28" data-end="332.789">returning functions so we have functions</span> <span data-start="332.789" data-end="335.34">that we turn functions and actually if</span> <span data-start="335.34" data-end="337.02">you've been doing JavaScript for a</span> <span data-start="337.02" data-end="339.06">little bit you're probably doing that as</span> <span data-start="339.06" data-end="344.069">well this is like loosely based on a</span> <span data-start="344.069" data-end="347.94">project I worked on and like one of the</span> <span data-start="347.94" data-end="350.43">things we did was define like a more</span> <span data-start="350.43" data-end="354.99">general validate function which would</span> <span data-start="354.99" data-end="359.19">then call which would then get passed in</span> <span data-start="359.19" data-end="361.5">the actual thing to validate actual</span> <span data-start="361.5" data-end="366.87">function to validate and and so you</span> <span data-start="366.87" data-end="368.759">could define more more precise</span> <span data-start="368.759" data-end="371.99">validation functions by passing in</span> <span data-start="371.99" data-end="374.19">functions that will would actually check</span> <span data-start="374.19" data-end="378.479">your values later on so you can see</span> <span data-start="378.479" data-end="385.6">required fields gets a function in and</span> <span data-start="385.61" data-end="390.599">sorry I'm a bit confused and returns</span> <span data-start="390.599" data-end="394.02">whether there's an error or not so that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="394.02" data-end="398.13">X that's an example of validates outputs</span> <span data-start="398.13" data-end="399.719">a function which you can then use later</span> <span data-start="399.719" data-end="406.59">on so utilities things you'll use quite</span> <span data-start="406.59" data-end="409.469">a lot when you're doing functional</span> <span data-start="409.469" data-end="414.75">programming map so when you do map on a</span> <span data-start="414.75" data-end="415.86">collection or</span> <span data-start="415.86" data-end="420.96">filter on a collection or reduce on the</span> <span data-start="420.96" data-end="425.669">collection so out of the box javascript</span> <span data-start="425.669" data-end="428.34">doesn't have anything very functional as</span> <span data-start="428.34" data-end="430.11">such because what you've got is</span> <span data-start="430.11" data-end="433.319">basically something defined on the air a</span> <span data-start="433.319" data-end="436.77">prototype but there are libraries out</span> <span data-start="436.77" data-end="438.629">there which will express things in a</span> <span data-start="438.629" data-end="440.909">more functional way like underscore.js</span> <span data-start="440.909" data-end="444.719">or slightly more esoteric ones like</span> <span data-start="444.719" data-end="449.849">dysfunctional one I found so basically</span> <span data-start="449.849" data-end="452.009">you can start throwing out some some</span> <span data-start="452.009" data-end="454.11">things you may use on a daily basis out</span> <span data-start="454.11" data-end="455.879">of the window like for instance the for</span> <span data-start="455.879" data-end="462.93">loop so for is actually it's not very</span> <span data-start="462.93" data-end="465.75">functional and it's also fairly clumsy</span> <span data-start="465.75" data-end="469.68">because it actually combines three</span> <span data-start="469.68" data-end="473.25">things so you could use a for loop to go</span> <span data-start="473.25" data-end="475.919">over a collection and that's basically</span> <span data-start="475.919" data-end="479.31">the same thing as wingham up or you</span> <span data-start="479.31" data-end="482.789">could do a for loop to basically only</span> <span data-start="482.789" data-end="486.15">change certain elements as basically</span> <span data-start="486.15" data-end="490.74">like doing a filter and then you might</span> <span data-start="490.74" data-end="493.68">want to calculate an end results by</span> <span data-start="493.68" data-end="496.05">going over collection and that's just</span> <span data-start="496.05" data-end="499.639">like doing reduce or left fold like the</span> <span data-start="499.639" data-end="504.3">functional types call it so yeah the for</span> <span data-start="504.3" data-end="507.449">loop is is is already pretty ugly to</span> <span data-start="507.449" data-end="509.43">start with because it's like straight</span> <span data-start="509.43" data-end="514.529">out of C but it's a it's also not super</span> <span data-start="514.529" data-end="517.529">good functionally so we're ramping up</span> <span data-start="517.529" data-end="519.779">slowly the difficulty started with very</span> <span data-start="519.779" data-end="523.64">easy and going a little bit harder so</span> <span data-start="523.64" data-end="527.37">currying so currying originally in</span> <span data-start="527.37" data-end="530.16">haskell is like the concept of you take</span> <span data-start="530.16" data-end="531.93">a function with several parameters and</span> <span data-start="531.93" data-end="533.899">you can kind of decompose it in</span> <span data-start="533.899" data-end="536.97">functions that take one parameter each</span> <span data-start="536.97" data-end="540.06">so you run your particular function with</span> <span data-start="540.06" data-end="541.86">the first parameter and then you had</span> <span data-start="541.86" data-end="543.54">your second parameter and every time you</span> <span data-start="543.54" data-end="545.699">output a function until you have the</span> <span data-start="545.699" data-end="547.26">function you actually basically want to</span> <span data-start="547.26" data-end="549.34">use</span> <span data-start="549.34" data-end="556.24">and well toy example here so yes I see</span> <span data-start="556.24" data-end="560.92">actually I have a bug already but so say</span> <span data-start="560.92" data-end="563.08">you have a very simple function called</span> <span data-start="563.08" data-end="566.41">phone listing if you try to run that</span> <span data-start="566.41" data-end="568.57">with just one parameter you'll get</span> <span data-start="568.57" data-end="571.33">in Haskell this would actually</span> <span data-start="571.33" data-end="574.24">work you can just take a function pass</span> <span data-start="574.24" data-end="575.83">it one parameter and it will know you</span> <span data-start="575.83" data-end="577.78">want to function back to to actually</span> <span data-start="577.78" data-end="582.28">continue working you can kind of fake</span> <span data-start="582.28" data-end="584.41">this in JavaScript as well by for</span> <span data-start="584.41" data-end="587.49">instance defining a partial function</span> <span data-start="587.49" data-end="590.83">which will take your original function</span> <span data-start="590.83" data-end="592.99">and any any number of arguments you want</span> <span data-start="592.99" data-end="595.3">to pass it and with a little bit of</span> <span data-start="595.3" data-end="599.62">magic it will return a function that has</span> <span data-start="599.62" data-end="601.87">already applied those first parameters</span> <span data-start="601.87" data-end="605.55">so again to go back to the toy example</span> <span data-start="605.55" data-end="608.86">say that some actually changes this</span> <span data-start="608.86" data-end="611.59">phone every month you can decide that</span> <span data-start="611.59" data-end="614.05">basically you want a function for just</span> <span data-start="614.05" data-end="618.49">some Sam's phone number I see actually</span> <span data-start="618.49" data-end="621.48">my original example involved girlfriends</span> <span data-start="621.48" data-end="624.61">some girlfriends so I know it's some</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="624.61" data-end="628.51">Sam's phone number and you can define a</span> <span data-start="628.51" data-end="630.4">function for just Sam's phone numbers</span> <span data-start="630.4" data-end="634.63">and just use that does that make any</span> <span data-start="634.63" data-end="637.72">sense to you yeps not too not too hard I</span> <span data-start="637.72"

data-end="740.01">story around yogurt and mo nuts is that</span> <span data-start="740.01" data-end="742.69">things are named pretty badly so it's</span> <span data-start="742.69"
