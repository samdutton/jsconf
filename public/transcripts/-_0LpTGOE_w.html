data-end="635.13">to the problem of vertical centering</span> <span data-start="635.13" data-end="637.68">it's you're not gonna believe that this</span> <span data-start="637.68" data-end="640.5">works but it does so that's just really</span> <span data-start="640.5" data-end="642.69">it and it gets pretty clean centered</span> <span data-start="642.69" data-end="643.589">sure thing</span> <span data-start="643.589" data-end="647.04">lovely so that's pretty much how you do</span> <span data-start="647.04" data-end="649.23">a vertical centering you just do a</span> <span data-start="649.23" data-end="652.08">margin on the item or the other way is</span> <span data-start="652.08" data-end="655.68">you can also modify</span> <span data-start="655.68" data-end="657.18">container instead of the item to have</span> <span data-start="657.18" data-end="659.37">more control this is a property called</span> <span data-start="659.37" data-end="661.92">justified content there's actually more</span> <span data-start="661.92" data-end="665.16">possible values for this but the ones</span> <span data-start="665.16" data-end="666.27">you're probably going to be using the</span> <span data-start="666.27" data-end="668.88">most is space around which means even at</span> <span data-start="668.88" data-end="672.18">the spacing vertically and there's</span> <span data-start="672.18" data-end="674.94">pretty much two of them justified</span> <span data-start="674.94" data-end="677.82">content is like vertical and a line</span> <span data-start="677.82" data-end="681.63">items is horizontal and that would also</span> <span data-start="681.63" data-end="684.029">get you a vertical Center and if you</span> <span data-start="684.029" data-end="685.11">notice this one you're styling a</span> <span data-start="685.11" data-end="687.24">container and set it there instead of</span> <span data-start="687.24" data-end="690.089">the box instead of the item it's telling</span> <span data-start="690.089" data-end="692.61">a parent instead and that would be</span> <span data-start="692.61" data-end="694.5">enough to get you to a vertical</span> <span data-start="694.5" data-end="698.55">centering just like that and essentially</span> <span data-start="698.55" data-end="701.61">thing about this is it's actually right</span> <span data-start="701.61" data-end="702.959">now it kind of looks like how you would</span> <span data-start="702.959" data-end="705.66">expect tables to work or something but</span> <span data-start="705.66" data-end="707.7">the really interesting things happen is</span> <span data-start="707.7" data-end="710.22">what if you combined that with media</span> <span data-start="710.22" data-end="712.74">queries so what could how could you make</span> <span data-start="712.74" data-end="714.66">something that would work as well on a</span> <span data-start="714.66" data-end="718.709">desktop and a tablet and a phone and the</span> <span data-start="718.709" data-end="721.56">thing is since these are all just really</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="721.56" data-end="723.39">CSS properties and you could just</span> <span data-start="723.39" data-end="726.75">restyle them anytime you need to say put</span> <span data-start="726.75" data-end="729.42">a media query for a tablet and just want</span> <span data-start="729.42" data-end="731.52">to change the Flex direction from column</span> <span data-start="731.52" data-end="734.75">which is to make things vertical to row</span> <span data-start="734.75" data-end="738">you just it's just really one little</span> <span data-start="738" data-end="740.85">property right there and that's really</span> <span data-start="740.85" data-end="743.58">perfect for things like you know when</span> <span data-start="743.58" data-end="746.43">you're switching from tablet to mobile</span> <span data-start="746.43" data-end="749.029">and another thing is you could even</span> <span data-start="749.029" data-end="752.49">reorder things without changing the dump</span> <span data-start="752.49" data-end="755.01">order so you just go through that icon</span> <span data-start="755.01" data-end="757.47">just went from right to left and you</span> <span data-start="757.47" data-end="759.779">just really have to change order this</span> <span data-start="759.779" data-end="762.329">little CSS property called order and you</span> <span data-start="762.329" data-end="764.19">could just set an order for any one of</span> <span data-start="764.19" data-end="765.57">those property if any one of those</span> <span data-start="765.57" data-end="767.31">elements and you can just reorder them</span> <span data-start="767.31" data-end="770.64">depending on your media query so if you</span> <span data-start="770.64" data-end="772.5">put all these things together and you</span> <span data-start="772.5" data-end="773.91">just put a little media courier right</span> <span data-start="773.91" data-end="779.04">here and basically it says that whenever</span> <span data-start="779.04" data-end="781.86">you're on a we're on a phone you're</span> <span data-start="781.86" data-end="783.6">going to make it vertical and you're</span> <span data-start="783.6" data-end="785.76">going to reorder the a bike</span> <span data-start="785.76" data-end="789.03">so in reap and practice this is what</span> <span data-start="789.03" data-end="793.71">it's probably going to look like and</span> <span data-start="793.71" data-end="796.38">that's it you were able to make a menu</span> <span data-start="796.38" data-end="799.38">with very very little modifications to</span> <span data-start="799.38" data-end="803.73">your CSS and uh if anyone wants to</span> <span data-start="803.73" data-end="806.79">follow along this this example is</span> <span data-start="806.79" data-end="810.63">actually posted over at github and old</span> <span data-start="810.63" data-end="813.35">flat sheet paper URL later on and</span> <span data-start="813.35" data-end="817.02">basically this entire thing is built out</span> <span data-start="817.02" data-end="820.41">of flex box just really every just like</span> <span data-start="820.41" data-end="823.68">all the macro layout is all made out of</span> <span data-start="823.68" data-end="825.66">flex box and the fantastic thing is it's</span> <span data-start="825.66" data-end="829.08">you could also nest your flex boxes so</span> <span data-start="829.08" data-end="832.32">you can have like three elements for</span> <span data-start="832.32" data-end="834.48">your main columns their main panes and</span> <span data-start="834.48" data-end="837.24">that's just your regular flex box kind</span> <span data-start="837.24" data-end="840.63">of properties so this one is on 20% 80%</span> <span data-start="840.63" data-end="842.61">of the other puts like min and Max with</span> <span data-start="842.61" data-end="844.38">just to make sure it doesn't collapse</span> <span data-start="844.38" data-end="847.41">too far and that's pretty much it you're</span> <span data-start="847.41" data-end="850.08">going to have like perfect columns on a</span> <span data-start="850.08" data-end="852.93">desktop but please by the way right if</span> <span data-start="852.93" data-end="854.49">anyone wants to follow along I tweeted</span> <span data-start="854.49" data-end="855.9">the link you can just check out my</span> <span data-start="855.9" data-end="860.99">twitter and link is over there and and</span> <span data-start="860.99" data-end="873.19">so this is what it looks like play okay</span> <span data-start="873.2" data-end="875.389">so basically just do the same kinds of</span> <span data-start="875.389" data-end="879.23">things wherein you take the take this</span> <span data-start="879.23" data-end="881.389">kinds of flexbox kind of properties and</span> <span data-start="881.389" data-end="882.829">put a little media elements and just</span> <span data-start="882.829" data-end="884.51">change the orientation from horizontal</span> <span data-start="884.51" data-end="887.3">to vertical and you just get a really</span> <span data-start="887.3" data-end="895.76">nice responsive almost effortlessly so</span> <span data-start="895.76" data-end="897.709">again it's just really all nested</span> <span data-start="897.709" data-end="900.05">flexbox so this is how it probably would</span> <span data-start="900.05" data-end="902.149">look like under your typical app where</span> <span data-start="902.149" data-end="904.07">you have like a horizontal kind of setup</span> <span data-start="904.07" data-end="906.98">and it would flatten out to a vertical</span> <span data-start="906.98" data-end="909.88">one whence you shrink your browser and</span> <span data-start="909.88" data-end="912.529">as you notice like you could just hide</span> <span data-start="912.529" data-end="914.329">one of the panes whenever you are in a</span> <span data-start="914.329" data-end="916.519">mobile just display knowing or some</span> <span data-start="916.519" data-end="918.74">things and that would be fine and just</span> <span data-start="918.74" data-end="921.5">nest flex spots within a flex box</span> <span data-start="921.5" data-end="924.41">so even the things inside the delisting</span> <span data-start="924.41" data-end="926.51">is a flex bucks and a flex bucks</span> <span data-start="926.51" data-end="929.3">so the menu you saw that a while ago</span> <span data-start="929.3" data-end="932.72">though and that listing is actually</span> <span data-start="932.72" data-end="935.329">pretty simple just like that and then</span> <span data-start="935.329" data-end="936.529">the pastor would probably do something</span> <span data-start="936.529" data-end="938.06">like this in like position absolute</span> <span data-start="938.06" data-end="940.76">position fixed with like top left bottom</span> <span data-start="940.76" data-end="943.01">right and fixed pixels but now at least</span> <span data-start="943.01" data-end="945.079">there's something more flexible and and</span> <span data-start="945.079" data-end="947">the thing is you can the wonderful thing</span> <span data-start="947" data-end="949.25">here is if you want to add like say a</span> <span data-start="949.25" data-end="951.89">search bar or something just right under</span> <span data-start="951.89" data-end="953.87">it it's pretty easy just insert another</span> <span data-start="953.87" data-end="956.089">dumb element and put like another flex</span> <span data-start="956.089" data-end="958.43">thing over there and that's it you could</span> <span data-start="958.43" data-end="960.5">you can pretty much change your eye up</span> <span data-start="960.5" data-end="965.39">any time you want and if you notice this</span> <span data-start="965.39" data-end="967.85">is actually it turns out to be something</span> <span data-start="967.85" data-end="970.279">that could actually work and here it is</span> <span data-start="970.279" data-end="973.01">like I don't know like 40 additional</span> <span data-start="973.01" data-end="975.68">lines of JavaScript so you make it kind</span> <span data-start="975.68" data-end="977.839">of do its thing and that's it we</span> <span data-start="977.839" data-end="982.24">actually we're able to make a pure CSS</span> <span data-start="982.24" data-end="985.069">approach to this whole responsive deal</span> <span data-start="985.069" data-end="988.31">and there's no fancy JavaScript to like</span> <span data-start="988.31" data-end="990.5">what happens when you size it down you</span> <span data-start="990.5" data-end="992.329">need to hide this and that just pretty</span> <span data-start="992.329" data-end="995.48">much that and all that was able to be</span> <span data-start="995.48" data-end="997.01">accomplished with Flex box by the way</span> <span data-start="997.01" data-end="1000.88">right here here is the Twitter and you</span> <span data-start="1000.88" data-end="1002.319">can just check out the link over there</span> <span data-start="1002.319" data-end="1005.54">if you want to look at the source so</span> <span data-start="1005.54" data-end="1008.389">trying to say is right now what temp cui</span> <span data-start="1008.389" data-end="1011.42">layout problems it's pretty much solved</span> <span data-start="1011.42" data-end="1013.009">when it comes to something that would be</span> <span data-start="1013.009" data-end="1016.1">on mobile and it's something that really</span> <span data-start="1016.1" data-end="1018.41">makes you lets you integrate things</span> <span data-start="1018.41" data-end="1021.41">really really fast because if you really</span> <span data-start="1021.41" data-end="1023.269">want to rearrange things or just want to</span> <span data-start="1023.269" data-end="1026.03">add and subtract and add you panels new</span> <span data-start="1026.03" data-end="1028.669">layouts you just really have to just add</span> <span data-start="1028.669" data-end="1031.339">another element and flex buckles take</span> <span data-start="1031.339" data-end="1033.079">care of trying to lay that out for you</span> <span data-start="1033.079" data-end="1036.709">and if you try to go through like you</span> <span data-start="1036.709" data-end="1039.709">know different websites out there a</span> <span data-start="1039.709" data-end="1042.079">couple of them can be solved but flexbox</span> <span data-start="1042.079" data-end="1044.78">really so they're a couple of there's a</span> <span data-start="1044.78" data-end="1047.66">lot of scene in the properties he could</span> <span data-start="1047.66" data-end="1050.09">also use for flex bucks it like say for</span> <span data-start="1050.09" data-end="1052.52">example align cell flex and is something</span> <span data-start="1052.52" data-end="1053.929">you would probably use a set of</span> <span data-start="1053.929" data-end="1057.679">float:right which while it goes pretty</span> <span data-start="1057.679" data-end="1060.44">much said that floats are evil so flex</span> <span data-start="1060.44" data-end="1062.44">logs is another way to get around it and</span> <span data-start="1062.44" data-end="1066.169">if you go to like content area it's</span> <span data-start="1066.169" data-end="1067.79">pretty much the same kind of deal and</span> <span data-start="1067.79" data-end="1070.33">you can even use a shorter flex box</span> <span data-start="1070.33" data-end="1073.73">syntax just flex 5 and flex 3 so</span> <span data-start="1073.73" data-end="1075.47">basically if you just specified the</span> <span data-start="1075.47" data-end="1077.96">growth parameter it's kind of trying to</span> <span data-start="1077.96" data-end="1079.94">figure out which one's bigger and which</span> <span data-start="1079.94" data-end="1082.159">one smaller and you know based on each</span> <span data-start="1082.159" data-end="1086.15">one's relative growth parameter and yeah</span> <span data-start="1086.15" data-end="1089.9">say this one — could be salt it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1089.9" data-end="1092.99">much everything is just really a grit</span> <span data-start="1092.99" data-end="1095.69">everything is just a something that can</span> <span data-start="1095.69" data-end="1097.49">be solved with nested layouts and</span> <span data-start="1097.49" data-end="1099.2">fantastic thing is if you if you're able</span> <span data-start="1099.2" data-end="1101.84">to do it if you could implement like a</span> <span data-start="1101.84" data-end="1104.179">layout like slack over something like</span> <span data-start="1104.179" data-end="1106.22">this it can be responsive down to tablet</span> <span data-start="1106.22" data-end="1109.28">so imagine like you could just say hide</span> <span data-start="1109.28" data-end="1114.35">the sidebar or no go to your under</span> <span data-start="1114.35" data-end="1116.45">sidebars to make sure that it could also</span> <span data-start="1116.45" data-end="1119.48">work in its head what so most of them</span> <span data-start="1119.48" data-end="1121.64">for the most part it's something that is</span> <span data-start="1121.64" data-end="1124.76">pretty much solved right now and if you</span> <span data-start="1124.76" data-end="1127.97">go to can I use comm the only thing that</span> <span data-start="1127.97" data-end="1130.04">really is slowing down the adoption of</span> <span data-start="1130.04" data-end="1131.179">flex bucks right now</span> <span data-start="1131.179" data-end="1134.659">is ie because the minimum thing the</span> <span data-start="1134.659" data-end="1136.85">minimum version that really supports</span> <span data-start="1136.85" data-end="1138.56">flex bucks for real as I</span> <span data-start="1138.56" data-end="1142.78">ie 11 so but as far as like the mobile</span> <span data-start="1142.78" data-end="1146.03">mobile adaptation even some of the older</span> <span data-start="1146.03" data-end="1147.65">iPhones older androids are able to</span> <span data-start="1147.65" data-end="1149.93">support it so it's something that is</span> <span data-start="1149.93" data-end="1151.49">actually pretty usable when it comes to</span> <span data-start="1151.49" data-end="1152.36">mobiles</span> <span data-start="1152.36" data-end="1154.82">so and if you're gonna do something like</span> <span data-start="1154.82" data-end="1156.77">mobile do I suggest you give it a try</span> <span data-start="1156.77" data-end="1161.84">and that's it for me so that's me Rico</span> <span data-start="1161.84"
