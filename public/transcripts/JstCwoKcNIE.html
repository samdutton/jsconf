data-start="1314.749" data-end="1317.659">is that javascript is executed on the</span> <span data-start="1317.659" data-end="1320.69">server so what just is possible with</span> <span data-start="1320.69" data-end="1324.559">opera mini is that you can can write</span> <span data-start="1324.559" data-end="1327.349">code that is using click events or mouse</span> <span

data-end="1332.36">but if you want to have more like</span> <span data-start="1332.36" data-end="1335.36">animations and dynamic staff that</span> <span data-start="1335.36" data-end="1337.73">doesn't

<span data-start="1351.5" data-end="1354.71">also funny they brought out windows</span> <span data-start="1354.71" data-end="1358.45">mobile 6.5 about half a year ago and</span> <span data-start="1358.45" data-end="1361.04">they have a strange mixture in the</span> <span data-start="1361.04" data-end="1363.95">browser they have a rendering engine of</span> <span

data-start="1371.51" data-end="1376.07">is then used and what I've heard the new</span> <span data-start="1376.07" data-end="1379.1">windows mobile seven will have an IE</span> <span data-start="1379.1" data-end="1381.73">seven so at least a little bit better</span> <span data-start="1381.73" data-end="1385.01">but I don't know what they will do but</span> <span data-start="1385.01" data-end="1387.08">at least the Opera runtime is always</span> <span data-start="1387.08" data-end="1390.38">running on on windows mobile so you can</span> <span
