DENIS: Good morning, guys.</span> <span data-start="34.96" data-end="36.98">I hope you have had a nice breakfast and that you're filled out with energy enough to make</span> <span data-start="36.98" data-end="42.94">this mental shift on applying NASA coding standards to JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="42.94" data-end="49.76">This talk is actually composed of two talks I have given before, so the first talk is</span> <span data-start="49.76" data-end="55.829">about exploring what boundaries of JavaScript could be, and then the second talk is about</span> <span data-start="55.829" data-end="61.9">why they're not there and how to get there, how to ensure more trust in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="61.9" data-end="65.7">My name is Denis Radin.</span> <span data-start="65.7" data-end="72.03">You will find me on the network as an open source commander.</span> <span data-start="72.03" data-end="75.859">I'm a mobile developer.</span> <span data-start="75.859" data-end="82.96">Before talking about JavaScript guidelines, let's talk about the guidelines for this universe.</span> <span data-start="82.96" data-end="91.07">One of the fundamental tendencies of this universe is a tendency to unification.</span> <span data-start="91.07" data-end="96.829">This universe respects unification — the shape of planets, the laws of physics are constant</span> <span data-start="96.829" data-end="101.319">every, will be unified in this universe.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="101.319" data-end="110.249">According to Wikipedia unification is to place elements in particular order built on strict</span> <span data-start="110.249" data-end="112.899">systems which is comfortable to use.</span> <span data-start="112.899" data-end="116.31">Increase the diversity, comfortable to use, strict system.</span> <span data-start="116.31" data-end="119.81">Yes there are standardised in this universe.</span> <span data-start="119.81" data-end="125.97">They very similar, a bit different, very individual but they tend to be standardised and then</span> <span data-start="125.97" data-end="130.619">humanity adopted this tending to standardisation also.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="130.619" data-end="135.96">Every time we start something new, we start on some new field, a technology field, industry,</span> <span data-start="135.96" data-end="142.22">or whatever, we start with whole variety of possible solutions.</span> <span data-start="142.22" data-end="151.3">It works for politics, for economics, for art, for engineering, and, yes, today, we're</span> <span data-start="151.3" data-end="153.87">going to talk about engineering first of all.</span> <span data-start="153.87" data-end="160.26">As I said, in the beginning, we do the whole lot of possible solutions whatever is the</span> <span data-start="160.26" data-end="165.02">best — but only the best, most sufficient survive.</span> <span data-start="165.02" data-end="166.31">You see a plan in the background.</span> <span data-start="166.31" data-end="168.94">- you see a plane in the background.</span> <span data-start="168.94" data-end="175.09">Can you distinguish if it is a Boeing or Airbus?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.09" data-end="176.44">Maybe someone can?</span> <span data-start="176.44" data-end="180.18">Maybe maybe not, to be honest.</span> <span data-start="180.18" data-end="183.51">This one, it's very similar.</span> <span data-start="183.51" data-end="186.76">They're really only specialist can distinguish Boeing or Airbus.</span> <span data-start="186.76" data-end="191.58">If you go to the plane, you can see if it is a Boeing or an Airbus, but it was not like</span> <span data-start="191.58" data-end="198.87">that in the beginning, some crazy constructions.</span> <span data-start="198.87" data-end="202.35">The same kind of story we see in software development.</span> <span data-start="202.35" data-end="209.54">We develop software for 60 years, but such a common thing as defining a UI is not standardised</span> <span data-start="209.54" data-end="210.57">yet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="210.57" data-end="218.42">It's not standardised yet, so it still looks like the early ages of aviation, so let's</span> <span data-start="218.42" data-end="226.53">try to compare early ages of aviation with our current state of what we recently had</span> <span data-start="226.53" data-end="242.41">in a front-end, developer, and compare solutions from ten development, the solutions — okay.</span> <span data-start="242.41" data-end="244.69">The early ages of aviation, I welcoming with it.</span> <span data-start="244.69" data-end="245.69">I don't think it works.</span> <span data-start="245.69" data-end="246.69"> —  I connect with it.</span> <span data-start="246.69" data-end="247.69">I don't think it works.</span> <span data-start="247.69" data-end="248.69">Can you help me with that?</span> <span data-start="248.69" data-end="249.69">I can connect to Wi-Fi.</span> <span data-start="249.69" data-end="250.69">Yes, Wi-Fi's good.</span> <span data-start="250.69" data-end="251.69">Should I put the show password?</span> <span data-start="251.69" data-end="252.69">You don't have the password.</span> <span data-start="252.69" data-end="253.69">Oh, really ..

<p><span data-start="405.79" data-end="413.12">UI was then UI innovation is going to be standardised with the UI development, so, why not to build</span> <span data-start="413.12" data-end="417.81">your aircraft instrument with HTML JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="417.81" data-end="418.81">Why not.</span> <span data-start="418.81" data-end="419.99">There is a motivation for that.</span> <span data-start="419.99" data-end="424.03">There is a motivation in terms of unification, liability and accessibility.</span> <span data-start="424.03" data-end="429.49">First of all, we live in the age of drones, unmanned drones, then access to a state of</span> <span data-start="429.49" data-end="435.62">a flight mission, where HTTP, for example, is a pretty good thing to have, then unification</span> <span data-start="435.62" data-end="440.71">means we have a lot of developers developing with JavaScript and web technologies, and</span> <span data-start="440.71" data-end="445.139">it's not that hard to develop flight instrument, to be honest.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.139" data-end="446.86">I mean, displaying interfaces.</span> <span data-start="446.86" data-end="448.76">It is good unified technology.</span> <span data-start="448.76" data-end="452.979">Also, if you think about the web platform, it is amazingly reliable.</span> <span data-start="452.979" data-end="457.43">The billions of users daily opens billions of pages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.43" data-end="465.71">And they constantly contribute to a safety and a reliability of a platform.</span> <span data-start="465.71" data-end="470.69">And also, once we have unified technology to general instruments, we can establish a</span> <span data-start="470.69" data-end="474.92">components market for our products and some of you can develop aircraft instruments and</span> <span data-start="474.92" data-end="477.169">sell them to Boeing, for example.</span> <span data-start="477.169" data-end="479.74">For example, why not?</span> <span data-start="479.74" data-end="485.79">Once I saw that there is a motivation, let's try to do that, it was not hard, to be honest.</span> <span data-start="485.79" data-end="493.94">There were some caveats, but then we ended up by a real, real flight on a real planet</span> <span data-start="493.94" data-end="505.5">was — Flying around Amsterdam around 1,000 metres here, a real HTML thing and we will</span> <span data-start="505.5" data-end="508.08">flying and relying on it.</span> <span data-start="508.08" data-end="514.87">Yes, maybe it was cool, actually.</span> <span data-start="514.87" data-end="523.159">First ever flight with HTML/JavaScript instrument, but then, okay would be we did it.</span> <span data-start="523.159" data-end="527.42">The considerations there to consider was of course reliability.</span> <span data-start="527.42" data-end="540.45">Of course, we need, if you have problems with your instruments, fuck -</span> <span data-start="540.45" data-end="547.19">less responsive instrument and it's better than can make fresh, then resources can — efficiency</span> <span data-start="547.19" data-end="552.07">also to think about maybe for this you can use GPU accelerated pass or alternative rendering</span> <span data-start="552.07" data-end="554.61">members of rendering on canvas.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.61" data-end="563.03">Now, you can imagine, you can take your place in an aeroplane and someone says to you, "Hey,</span> <span data-start="563.03" data-end="570.26">with man, flight commander have a JavaScript-driven instrument in his cabin."</span> <span data-start="570.26" data-end="575.279">You're going to fly it on a Boeing, on a JavaScript-driven Boeing.</span> <span data-start="575.279" data-end="581.59">The web developer, JavaScript developer dropped fuel lines and you're going to fly with that.</span> <span data-start="581.59" data-end="586.06">You're going to be scared definitely, or not?</span> <span data-start="586.06" data-end="589.33">Who will fly this plane?</span> <span data-start="589.33" data-end="592.49">Yes, it was quick.</span> <span data-start="592.49" data-end="594.86">I get back.</span> <span data-start="594.86" data-end="595.86">Yes.</span> <span data-start="595.86" data-end="600.12">But just let's think why you're not going to fly this plane.</span> <span data-start="600.12" data-end="604.959">It is basically your perception of yourself, your perception of web development, and your</span> <span data-start="604.959" data-end="606.59">perception of JavaScript development.</span> <span data-start="606.59" data-end="613.209">It is basically your trust in yourself, your trust in the web platform, it is your trust</span> <span data-start="613.209" data-end="615.92">in guidelines in what is normal for JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="615.92" data-end="621.83">Of course, it is easy to understand why it happened because the price, the price of mistake,</span> <span data-start="621.83" data-end="625.48">of error, is very cheap in a JavaScript roll.</span> <span data-start="625.48" data-end="631.92">Just reload the page, everything starts again, you're safe, but then the rest of the missions,</span> <span data-start="631.92" data-end="634.21">when it's not like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="634.21" data-end="641.57">And that was a web platform, JavaScript language, we have more and more of such missions.</span> <span data-start="641.57" data-end="648.83">And we need to rethink our guidelines and rethink what's normal for JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="648.83" data-end="655.31">And change the way people perceive JavaScript and how we trust ourselves.</span> <span data-start="655.31" data-end="660.5">So, we need more guidelines, probably, to change the way what's normal.</span> <span data-start="660.5" data-end="663.38">Let's have a look at Jet Propulsion Laboratory which is the institution.</span> <span data-start="663.38" data-end="671.5">It is a NASA kind of branch which works on projects like Curiosity Mars Rover and the</span> <span data-start="671.5" data-end="681.5">Voyager, which is amazing because it is 36 years flying in deep space without any bucks.</span> <span data-start="681.5" data-end="685.48">Can JavaScript do that?</span> <span data-start="685.48" data-end="686.8">No.</span> <span data-start="686.8" data-end="692.82">We have a similar problem, when I used to work for Unity Media on a set-top boxes.</span> <span data-start="692.82" data-end="700.74">We had the set-top boxes, half a million lines of code, and the stability and performance</span> <span data-start="700.74" data-end="705.55">were pretty high-priority, so one month without reset was pretty challenging.</span> <span data-start="705.55" data-end="708.6">We tried to adopt this NASA guidelines.</span> <span data-start="708.6" data-end="714.36">It is not — it is not some weird thing.</span> <span data-start="714.36" data-end="720.18">It is really guidelines which GPLU and NASA use and they're published online.</span> <span data-start="720.18" data-end="721.339">You can check them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="721.339" data-end="722.71">Yes, let's try.</span> <span data-start="722.71" data-end="728.97">Rule number 1: no function should be longer than what can be printed on a sheet of paper.</span> <span data-start="728.97" data-end="733.06">It comes from all times.</span> <span data-start="733.06" data-end="735.32">You may have seen this photo.</span> <span data-start="735.32" data-end="742.35">It is Margaret Hamilton with the author of Apollo mission source code, staying with the</span> <span data-start="742.35" data-end="747.279">source code, basically, and it's easy to understand why they were talking about sheets of paper</span> <span data-start="747.279" data-end="757.149">at that time, but now — it means higher readability compared to what you have written altogether,</span> <span data-start="757.149" data-end="760.39">you can impose your functions better.</span> <span data-start="760.39" data-end="764.32">Better at composibility, also.</span> <span data-start="764.32" data-end="770.05">Then, yes, in if you don't do it, it is obvious.</span> <span data-start="770.05" data-end="772.18">It's really obvious to adopt this rule.</span> <span data-start="772.18" data-end="781.38">Rule number 2 constructs do not use go-to statements and indirect recursion.</span> <span data-start="781.38" data-end="784.79">Go-to is easy to understand but what about recursion?</span> </p>
