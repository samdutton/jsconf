Jordan Santo and so a quick</span> <span data-start="44.339" data-end="46.71">introduction the Web Audio it's a</span> <span data-start="46.71" data-end="49.89">relatively new API all major browsers</span> <span data-start="49.89" data-end="52.17">support this except ie but they just</span> <span data-start="52.17" data-end="53.519">announced this week that they will</span> <span data-start="53.519" data-end="54.96">support this in the next version which</span> <span data-start="54.96" data-end="59.42">is awesome so this Audio API is a</span> <span data-start="59.42" data-end="62.909">modular routing API use for manipulating</span> <span data-start="62.909" data-end="66.509">audio it's using games synthesizers and</span> <span data-start="66.509" data-end="68.729">audio production tools so what is the</span> <span data-start="68.729" data-end="72">signal processing component of this so</span> <span data-start="72" data-end="74.509">signal processing is the theory of</span> <span data-start="74.509" data-end="77.399">manipulating and analyzing a signal in</span> <span data-start="77.399" data-end="80.34">the case of Web Audio the signal is an</span> <span data-start="80.34" data-end="82.88">audio buffer so just a giant array of</span> <span data-start="82.88" data-end="89.329">data so quick about me I love this gif</span> <span data-start="89.329" data-end="92.25">so I work for Mozilla on the SDK team</span> <span data-start="92.25" data-end="94.71">for the SDK for add-ons and developer</span> <span data-start="94.71" data-end="97.02">tools and also the Web Audio developer</span> <span data-start="97.02" data-end="102.509">tools so the audio API it is a route</span> <span data-start="102.509" data-end="104.7">based audio API for processing audio</span> <span data-start="104.7" data-end="107.31">signals as constructed as a directed</span> <span data-start="107.31" data-end="110.159">acyclic graph so the audio flows from</span> <span data-start="110.159" data-end="113.31">source nodes to the destination node and</span> <span data-start="113.31" data-end="114.929">along the way it gets either transformed</span> <span data-start="114.929" data-end="121.229">or analyzed and manipulated and all the</span> <span data-start="121.229" data-end="123.749">audio nodes are created within a sandbox</span> <span data-start="123.749" data-end="126.63">called the audio context all nodes must</span> <span data-start="126.63" data-end="128.55">live within a context and the context</span> <span data-start="128.55" data-end="130.53">decides things like what's the sample</span> <span data-start="130.53" data-end="134.4">rate of this whole graph</span> <span data-start="134.4" data-end="137.22">so it can be a little confusing because</span> <span data-start="137.22" data-end="142.4">it's unlike most other new web api's so</span> <span data-start="142.4" data-end="144.78">therefore no types these aren't official</span> <span data-start="144.78" data-end="147.36">these are just ways to classify them to</span> <span data-start="147.36" data-end="149.459">better understand the API so there are</span> <span data-start="149.459" data-end="153.45">source nodes and so source nodes emit</span> <span data-start="153.45" data-end="155.64">sound for the origin of some kind of</span> <span data-start="155.64" data-end="158.79">signal we can make a source nodes out of</span> <span data-start="158.79" data-end="162.15">things like the WebRTC audio stream HTML</span> <span data-start="162.15" data-end="168.23">audio element oscillator and a last one</span> <span data-start="168.23" data-end="171.69">something else and so this is where the</span> <span data-start="171.69" data-end="174.989">origin of sound so the sound travels</span> <span data-start="174.989" data-end="177.84">through the directed graph i'm it could</span> <span data-start="177.84" data-end="180.09">possibly either transformer analyzed so</span> <span data-start="180.09" data-end="181.92">transformation audio node would be</span> <span data-start="181.92" data-end="185.25">something like delay filter compression</span> <span data-start="185.25" data-end="187.109">something they'll transform the audio</span> <span data-start="187.109" data-end="189.989">signal to so it sounds differently an</span> <span data-start="189.989" data-end="192.39">animal ization node it doesn't affect</span> <span data-start="192.39" data-end="194.76">the actual signal it just lets us better</span> <span data-start="194.76" data-end="196.59">interpret it and get information about</span> <span data-start="196.59" data-end="198.87">it so we'd do that for something like an</span> <span data-start="198.87" data-end="202.049">audio visualization and finally we have</span> <span data-start="202.049" data-end="204.419">a destination node and anything that we</span> <span data-start="204.419" data-end="206.79">want to hear must ultimately arrive at</span> <span data-start="206.79" data-end="208.889">the destination so in this example we</span> <span data-start="208.889" data-end="211.56">have three sources and they could be</span> <span data-start="211.56" data-end="213.48">anything really and it goes through some</span> <span data-start="213.48" data-end="216.15">filtering distortion panning reverb and</span> <span data-start="216.15" data-end="218.519">ultimately a compressor and the</span> <span data-start="218.519" data-end="220.079">destination node in the Web Audio API is</span> <span data-start="220.079" data-end="223.65">a abstraction for our sound cards so if</span> <span data-start="223.65" data-end="225.54">we want if we have a source node and we</span> <span data-start="225.54" data-end="226.23">want to hear it</span> <span data-start="226.23" data-end="228.78">whether it's a mp3 file or whatever it</span> <span data-start="228.78" data-end="230.579">only has to flow into the the</span> <span data-start="230.579" data-end="232.109">destination node so we can actually hear</span> <span data-start="232.109" data-end="236.639">it so if this still doesn't make sense</span> <span data-start="236.639" data-end="240.389">here's a Viking metal band so you go to</span> <span data-start="240.389" data-end="242.639">a concert the guitarist is setting up</span> <span data-start="242.639" data-end="245.609">and the new thing of the guitar is a</span> <span data-start="245.609" data-end="247.44">source node this is where the sound</span> <span data-start="247.44" data-end="250.59">originates the signal travels from the</span> <span data-start="250.59" data-end="253.919">guitar through the cable into a this is</span> <span data-start="253.919" data-end="255.359">a Viking metal band so they have a lot</span> <span data-start="255.359" data-end="258.06">of distortion so they to transform the</span> <span data-start="258.06" data-end="260.099">clean guitar signal it goes into a</span> <span data-start="260.099" data-end="261.93">distortion pedal makes it heavy much</span> <span data-start="261.93" data-end="263.49">louder you know things like that it</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="265.86">transforms the signal and then</span> <span data-start="265.86" data-end="267.09">ultimately from the</span> <span data-start="267.09" data-end="269.25">you distortion pedal go into an</span> <span data-start="269.25" data-end="271.05">amplifier so we can actually perceive it</span> <span data-start="271.05" data-end="275.35">and you know it'll be a good concert</span> <span data-start="275.36" data-end="278.55">another way to think about this flow</span> <span data-start="278.55" data-end="281.93">this audio context flow is similar to</span> <span data-start="281.93" data-end="285.33">middleware in routing so like expressjs</span> <span data-start="285.33" data-end="288.18">middleware you can think of a request as</span> <span data-start="288.18" data-end="290.58">a source so when someone requests some</span> <span data-start="290.58" data-end="294.72">file from a server that's the origin of</span> <span data-start="294.72" data-end="296.58">this process and then ultimately it</span> <span data-start="296.58" data-end="298.83">could go through several pieces of</span> <span data-start="298.83" data-end="300.36">middleware when this middleware can</span> <span data-start="300.36" data-end="302.61">transform or analyze the requests</span> <span data-start="302.61" data-end="304.68">throughout so if you want to you know</span> <span data-start="304.68" data-end="307.44">have a middleware check make sure the</span> <span data-start="307.44" data-end="309.36">users logged in or something for some</span> <span data-start="309.36" data-end="311.61">resource then the middleware would</span> <span data-start="311.61" data-end="313.77">analyze that and determine whether it</span> <span data-start="313.77" data-end="316.38">should proceed and ultimately you get a</span> <span data-start="316.38" data-end="319.05">response which is the final destination</span> <span data-start="319.05" data-end="324.889">for that so a really simple example</span> <span data-start="324.889" data-end="327.24">first we create the audio context again</span> <span data-start="327.24" data-end="329.19">all nodes and everything must live</span> <span data-start="329.19" data-end="330.6">within audio context and you have to</span> <span data-start="330.6" data-end="332.039">have the context to create these nodes</span> <span data-start="332.039" data-end="334.05">as well so we instantiate an audio</span> <span data-start="334.05" data-end="336.12">context and create an oscillator and a</span> <span data-start="336.12" data-end="339.24">gain node to use the node types I</span> <span data-start="339.24" data-end="340.74">explained before an oscillator is a</span> <span data-start="340.74" data-end="343.08">source node so it creates a for example</span> <span data-start="343.08" data-end="345.33">a sine wave so that's where the sound</span> <span data-start="345.33" data-end="346.83">originates and I can travel through a</span> <span data-start="346.83" data-end="349.349">gain node and gain is a fancy word for</span> <span data-start="349.349" data-end="353.94">how loud something is so it originally</span> <span data-start="353.94" data-end="355.53">it's the signal originates from an</span> <span data-start="355.53" data-end="357.33">oscillator travels through a gain node</span> <span data-start="357.33" data-end="358.86">since we connected our oscillator to our</span> <span data-start="358.86" data-end="360.419">gain node and then the gain node</span> <span data-start="360.419" data-end="361.979">connected to the destination so we can</span> <span data-start="361.979" data-end="363.84">actually hear it and then we have to</span> <span data-start="363.84" data-end="368.31">start the oscillator so here's an</span> <span data-start="368.31" data-end="374.16">example make sure we're quiet so it's a</span> <span data-start="374.16" data-end="378.09">really annoying sound so here's an</span> <span data-start="378.09" data-end="381.24">example of the audio tools in Firefox</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="386.52">which just draws the contacts graph so</span> <span data-start="386.52" data-end="387.599">we can see what node is connected to</span> <span data-start="387.599" data-end="390.03">which node we can also edit things so in</span> <span data-start="390.03" data-end="392.37">the last slide we solved an oscillator</span> <span data-start="392.37" data-end="393.84">node that's connected to the gain node</span> <span data-start="393.84" data-end="395.789">which is connected to the destination of</span> <span data-start="395.789" data-end="398.25">the far right the other two notes the</span> <span data-start="398.25" data-end="399.87">analyzer and script process are just for</span> <span data-start="399.87" data-end="400.41">the demos</span> <span data-start="400.41" data-end="403.74">to display the time domain data so it</span> <span data-start="403.74" data-end="407.13">that's obviously a sine wave very fast</span> <span data-start="407.13" data-end="411.44">so oscillators create these tones with</span> <span data-start="411.44" data-end="414.63">periodic cycles so assignment and their</span> <span data-start="414.63" data-end="416.85">prey by some kind of equation so a sine</span> <span data-start="416.85" data-end="419.49">wave is created by the mathematical sine</span> <span data-start="419.49" data-end="423.78">function and all these waves are</span> <span data-start="423.78" data-end="426.33">periodic waves so they're repeated</span> <span data-start="426.33" data-end="429.98">patterns so let me make sure there's</span> <span data-start="429.98" data-end="432.39">other type of oscillator than sine wave</span> <span data-start="432.39" data-end="438.66">we can have a triangle and it's named</span> <span data-start="438.66" data-end="439.8">that way because it looks like a</span> <span data-start="439.8" data-end="446.75">triangle square wave is that too loud</span> <span data-start="446.75" data-end="451.8">excellent and my favorite you can see</span> <span data-start="451.8" data-end="453.96">what how these waves are named because</span> <span data-start="453.96" data-end="455.55">they actually look like the object that</span> <span data-start="455.55" data-end="459.3">they were named after so if those</span> <span data-start="459.3" data-end="461.64">familiar with electronica music or</span> <span data-start="461.64" data-end="463.59">synthesizers or you know if you ever</span> <span data-start="463.59" data-end="466.35">played a game boy a lot of these sounds</span> <span data-start="466.35" data-end="471.26">are the foundation of any synthesizer</span> <span data-start="471.26" data-end="473.82">synthesizers use these basic waveforms</span> <span data-start="473.82" data-end="476.22">to construct more abstract and complex</span> <span data-start="476.22" data-end="477.84">shapes and we'll do a little bit that in</span> <span data-start="477.84" data-end="482.61">a bit so we can change the type so right</span> <span data-start="482.61" data-end="484.41">now it's a sawtooth and we also changed</span> <span data-start="484.41" data-end="487.83">the frequency so a frequency is measured</span> <span data-start="487.83" data-end="492.48">in hertz and it's a unit that represents</span> <span data-start="492.48" data-end="493.92">how many times per second in this</span> <span data-start="493.92" data-end="497.48">periodic wave cycles so at 440 Hertz</span> <span data-start="497.48" data-end="500.46">this shape is repeated forty times per</span> <span data-start="500.46" data-end="502.38">second and that's what we perceive as</span> <span data-start="502.38" data-end="505.44">pitch so 440 is uh you know concert</span> <span data-start="505.44" data-end="514.11">eight for let's so if I drop this in</span> <span data-start="514.11" data-end="519.57">octave to 220 we can see we actually</span> <span data-start="519.57" data-end="522.539">perceive a lower pitch and the it's a</span> <span data-start="522.539" data-end="524.34">much you can see the cycles are a little</span> <span data-start="524.34" data-end="526.35">bit slower it's still 220 times a second</span> <span data-start="526.35" data-end="528.57">but if we drop this to something</span> <span data-start="528.57" data-end="531.9">inaudible like below 20 Hertz 5 let's</span> <span data-start="531.9" data-end="533.779">say</span> <span data-start="533.779" data-end="536.04">we can actually perceive that because</span> <span data-start="536.04" data-end="540.18">we're not robots right yeah we're</span> <span data-start="540.18" data-end="547.92">scaring all the animals right now so I</span> <span data-start="547.92" data-end="550.77">mean that's a really terrible sound no</span> <span data-start="550.77" data-end="552.589">one wants to listen to pure sine waves</span> <span data-start="552.589" data-end="555.18">all the dogs are angry right now so we</span> <span data-start="555.18" data-end="557.76">can manipulate these signals in a bunch</span> <span data-start="557.76" data-end="560.07">of different ways so one technique is</span> <span data-start="560.07" data-end="562.74">amplitude modulation in which we want to</span> <span data-start="562.74" data-end="566.87">chain an amplitude is the so how high</span> <span data-start="566.87" data-end="570.11">the signal is and which we perceive as</span> <span data-start="570.11" data-end="573.39">volume so if we want a really loud sine</span> <span data-start="573.39" data-end="576.21">wave we would have really large cycles</span> <span data-start="576.21" data-end="577.2">one quiet</span> <span data-start="577.2" data-end="580.56">sine wave would be a really subtle wave</span> <span data-start="580.56" data-end="583.02">so what we can do is and the previous</span> <span data-start="583.02" data-end="585.06">example we connected one audio node to</span> <span data-start="585.06" data-end="586.35">another audio node but we can also</span> <span data-start="586.35" data-end="588.69">connect audio nodes which again is just</span> <span data-start="588.69" data-end="591.74">this pure signal to an audio parameter</span> <span data-start="591.74" data-end="595.68">so in amplitude modulation so we have a</span> <span data-start="595.68" data-end="598.14">carrier signal which this is our pitch</span> <span data-start="598.14" data-end="600.24">same thing we did in the last one so</span> <span data-start="600.24" data-end="603.33">let's assume this is a 440 sine wave we</span> <span data-start="603.33" data-end="605.43">also have a modulating sine wave signal</span> <span data-start="605.43" data-end="609.42">that affects some other property in the</span> <span data-start="609.42" data-end="611.67">audio context so it's modulating sine</span> <span data-start="611.67" data-end="614.49">wave signal is much lower frequency than</span> <span data-start="614.49" data-end="616.29">the carrier signal so we use this</span> <span data-start="616.29" data-end="618.27">modulating sine wave signal to between</span> <span data-start="618.27" data-end="621.63">between a loud sound and a soft sound so</span> <span data-start="621.63" data-end="623.73">if we combine these two signals or have</span> <span data-start="623.73" data-end="626.49">the modulating wave signal affect the</span> <span data-start="626.49" data-end="629.76">subsequent gain we can see in the last</span> <span data-start="629.76" data-end="633.63">image as the modulating sine wave signal</span> <span data-start="633.63" data-end="635.79">approaches negative one the carrier</span> <span data-start="635.79" data-end="640.2">signal gets much quieter so implement</span> <span data-start="640.2" data-end="641.97">something like this similar to the</span> <span data-start="641.97" data-end="645.81">previous one we have a an oscillator or</span> <span data-start="645.81" data-end="647.55">carrier signal connected to our gain</span> <span data-start="647.55" data-end="649.62">node RJ nodes connected to our contacts</span> <span data-start="649.62" data-end="651.36">destination just like we had in the last</span> <span data-start="651.36" data-end="653.459">example we also have another oscillator</span> <span data-start="653.459" data-end="657">our modulator that's connected to the</span> <span data-start="657" data-end="660.99">gain nodes gain Auto audio parameter so</span> <span data-start="660.99" data-end="663.18">as the
