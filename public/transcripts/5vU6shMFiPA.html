data-end="376.12">beat Susan this way and so I started</span> <span data-start="376.12" data-end="377.02">thinking about how this problem is</span> <span data-start="377.02" data-end="379.09">formed and so for a human it's</span> <span data-start="379.09" data-end="381.1">interesting because if you think of the</span> <span data-start="381.1" data-end="383.289">problem in two parts the set making is</span> <span data-start="383.289" data-end="384.94">the hardest part for a human when you</span> <span data-start="384.94" data-end="386.979">you can quickly see these cards and you</span> <span

data-end="392.5">computer it's actually the opposite the</span> <span data-start="392.5" data-end="395.139">set making is super easy and it's the</span> <span data-start="395.139" data-end="396.46">vision part that's the hard part</span> <span data-start="396.46" data-end="398.2">so as you can tell we're going to</span> <span data-start="398.2" data-end="399.61">confuse your vision the crap out of this</span> <span data-start="399.61" data-end="400.05">problem</span> <span data-start="400.05" data-end="404.11">alright here's the plan we I want this</span> <span data-start="404.11" data-end="405.4">to run on my phone so I'm gonna use the</span> <span data-start="405.4" data-end="407.87">camera on my phone get into a browse</span> <span data-start="407.87" data-end="410.39">put on the canvas and then I get pixels</span> <span data-start="410.39" data-end="412.79">from those pixels we're gonna identify a</span> <span data-start="412.79" data-end="416.45">bunch of cards in the thing from there</span> <span data-start="416.45" data-end="419.21">we want to extract out every card and</span> <span data-start="419.21" data-end="420.5">then put each card we want to identify</span> <span data-start="420.5" data-end="422.3">the color number of shading and shape</span> <span data-start="422.3" data-end="423.5">and then eventually we're just going to</span> <span data-start="423.5" data-end="424.85">boot forth and solve for this at the end</span> <span data-start="424.85" data-end="427.24">all right so let's get into it</span> <span data-start="427.24" data-end="430.79">so this is my test image for this for</span> <span data-start="430.79" data-end="433.54">this thing as you can see bunch of cards</span> <span data-start="433.54" data-end="436.1">getting this out the things that you</span> <span data-start="436.1" data-end="437.54">kind of care about are these ones so</span> <span data-start="437.54" data-end="439.37">this get image data is what we care</span> <span data-start="439.37" data-end="441.83">about here we get out this big huge</span> <span data-start="441.83" data-end="443.6">number array so this looks kind of</span> <span data-start="443.6" data-end="448.94">foreboding and creepy it's got one no</span> <span data-start="448.94" data-end="451.94">eleven million pixels in it so let's go</span> <span data-start="451.94" data-end="453.26">over what this image data object is</span> <span data-start="453.26" data-end="456.62">really quickly you can think of images</span> <span data-start="456.62" data-end="459.92">as a series of pixels here we have not</span> <span data-start="459.92" data-end="463.55">six pixels six huge pixels and then each</span> <span data-start="463.55" data-end="466.13">pixel is itself basically four numbers</span> <span data-start="466.13" data-end="468.83">there's a red green blue and a</span> <span data-start="468.83" data-end="470.57">transparency or alpha component or GPA</span> <span data-start="470.57" data-end="473.06">so that's four numbers times six pixels</span> <span data-start="473.06" data-end="475.49">that's 24 numbers so that's our 24</span> <span data-start="475.49" data-end="478.55">numbers that we see here and then it's a</span> <span data-start="478.55" data-end="480.17">flat array so it's one dimensional but</span> <span data-start="480.17" data-end="482">if you know the width that you can you</span> <span data-start="482" data-end="484.67">know basically we wrap it and so this</span> <span data-start="484.67" data-end="487.31">array corresponds to this picture up</span> <span data-start="487.31" data-end="489.44">here and if I change this that trend so</span> <span data-start="489.44" data-end="491.09">that's transparency so that goes away I</span> <span data-start="491.09" data-end="494.15">can bring it back I can make it black I</span> <span data-start="494.15" data-end="498.23">can make this one red so you can see how</span> <span data-start="498.23" data-end="499.97">those think go so we're gonna be using</span> <span data-start="499.97" data-end="501.26">this image data object a lot throughout</span> <span data-start="501.26" data-end="503.21">this talk so I gotta get familiar with</span> <span data-start="503.21" data-end="503.54">it</span> <span data-start="503.54" data-end="506.63">so first step is we want to threshold</span> <span data-start="506.63" data-end="508.46">out we want to simplify this picture a</span> <span data-start="508.46" data-end="511.01">whole bunch when I basically changed</span> <span data-start="511.01" data-end="514.82">into straight black and white and that's</span> <span data-start="514.82" data-end="516.86">to make our job a lot easier later on to</span> <span data-start="516.86" data-end="520.73">do this this is called threshold incan</span> <span data-start="520.73" data-end="523.22">vertebrae are G B value into a gray and</span> <span data-start="523.22" data-end="525.14">then if that gray is over below a</span> <span data-start="525.14" data-end="527.36">certain value I either set it to white</span> <span data-start="527.36" data-end="530.57">55 or black zero and so if I change this</span> <span data-start="530.57" data-end="533.24">this slider you can kind of see how it</span> <span data-start="533.24" data-end="536.69">affects the image and then an</span> <span data-start="536.69" data-end="538.34">entertaining thing to note here is that</span> <span data-start="538.34" data-end="540.32">you'll notice that this is not a linear</span> <span data-start="540.32"
