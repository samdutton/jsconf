we've got a lot to cover</span> <span data-start="29.34" data-end="31.62">here I'm glad we got started pretty</span> <span data-start="31.62" data-end="35.13">quickly so we should be good so I</span> <span data-start="35.13" data-end="36.72">realized that the term static</span> <span data-start="36.72" data-end="38.79">metaprogramming probably requires a</span> <span data-start="38.79" data-end="42.84">little bit of explanation so how many</span> <span data-start="42.84" data-end="47.1">people know what metaprogramming is so a</span> <span data-start="47.1" data-end="48.93">pretty good chunk of you so</span> <span data-start="48.93" data-end="50.67">metaprogramming is basically writing</span> <span data-start="50.67" data-end="53.19">programs that manipulate either</span> <span data-start="53.19" data-end="56.22">themselves or other programs as data and</span> <span data-start="56.22" data-end="58.05">usually when we talk about meta</span> <span data-start="58.05" data-end="59.49">programming we're talking about things</span> <span data-start="59.49" data-end="62.25">like you know hooking getters and</span> <span data-start="62.25" data-end="65.479">setters and customizing method dispatch</span> <span data-start="65.479" data-end="67.979">languages like Ruby and small talk</span> <span data-start="67.979" data-end="70.11">really allow you to kind of reach into</span> <span data-start="70.11" data-end="72.619">the runtime and do some funky things</span> <span data-start="72.619" data-end="74.759">what I want to talk about today is not</span> <span data-start="74.759" data-end="76.979">this kind of meta programming but rather</span> <span data-start="76.979" data-end="80.97">programs that manipulate code so that's</span> <span data-start="80.97" data-end="82.32">kind of a different type of meta</span> <span data-start="82.32" data-end="84.509">programming which some people call</span> <span data-start="84.509" data-end="90.3">static meta programming so a thing that</span> <span data-start="90.3" data-end="92.88">manipulates code a compiler is actually</span> <span data-start="92.88" data-end="96.03">a really good example of that right a</span> <span data-start="96.03" data-end="97.979">compiler is a thing that takes code in</span> <span data-start="97.979" data-end="102.179">and outputs code now normally a compiler</span> <span data-start="102.179" data-end="104.369">is something that takes in some sort of</span> <span data-start="104.369" data-end="106.47">high-level code and outputs something</span> <span data-start="106.47" data-end="109.259">lower-level so a C++ compiler you know</span> <span data-start="109.259" data-end="112.05">spits out machine code and a Java</span> <span data-start="112.05" data-end="115.709">compiler spits out Java byte code but</span> <span data-start="115.709" data-end="117.179">you know you can also compile to another</span> <span data-start="117.179" data-end="119.58">high-level language probably a lot of</span> <span data-start="119.58" data-end="121.229">you familiar with CoffeeScript right</span> <span data-start="121.229" data-end="123.509">which just compiles to JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="123.509" data-end="125.13">there's a ton of other languages that do</span> <span data-start="125.13" data-end="127.649">this people sometimes call these</span> <span data-start="127.649" data-end="130.259">transpilers it's basically just a</span> <span data-start="130.259" data-end="135">compiler it's the same thing so compiler</span> <span data-start="135" data-end="138.47">basically consists of two main parts the</span> <span data-start="138.47" data-end="141.87">first thing is the parser so the parser</span> <span data-start="141.87" data-end="144.87">takes source code and it creates some</span> <span data-start="144.87" data-end="147.09">sort of structured representation of</span> <span data-start="147.09" data-end="149.25">that source code usually we call this a</span> <span data-start="149.25" data-end="154.02">parse tree or an abstract syntax tree</span> <span data-start="154.02" data-end="156.06">and the second main part of a compiler</span> <span data-start="156.06" data-end="158.43">is a code generator so the code</span> <span data-start="158.43" data-end="161.82">generator takes a parse tree you know</span> <span data-start="161.82" data-end="163.71">does some analysis on it walks over it</span> <span data-start="163.71" data-end="167.46">and spits out the object code and of</span> <span data-start="167.46" data-end="169.82">course this is this is a pretty big</span> <span data-start="169.82" data-end="172.56">simplification in particular there's</span> <span data-start="172.56" data-end="174.75">usually a lot of stuff that happens in</span> <span data-start="174.75" data-end="176.61">that middle step there of analysis and</span> <span data-start="176.61" data-end="180.78">optimization those things but like I</span> <span data-start="180.78" data-end="183.78">said you know we don't we we don't</span> <span data-start="183.78" data-end="185.34">always have to compile from a high level</span> <span data-start="185.34" data-end="187.74">language to a low level language we can</span> <span data-start="187.74" data-end="190.83">compile you know to another high level</span> <span data-start="190.83" data-end="192.78">language or we can compile to the same</span> <span data-start="192.78" data-end="194.85">language that we started with and this</span> <span data-start="194.85" data-end="198.66">is what I want to talk about next so I'm</span> <span data-start="198.66" data-end="200.48">going to show you some examples of using</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="200.48" data-end="202.38">JavaScript compiler called</span> <span data-start="202.38" data-end="206.28">s prema prema is a nice simple fast</span> <span data-start="206.28" data-end="209.01">compiler for JavaScript but it's also</span> <span data-start="209.01" data-end="210.69">written in JavaScript which is kind of</span> <span data-start="210.69" data-end="211.11">cool</span> <span data-start="211.11" data-end="213.78">so you can you can dive in and check out</span> <span data-start="213.78" data-end="215.1">the source and understand what it's</span> <span data-start="215.1" data-end="219.99">doing and Esprit m'a also has two</span> <span data-start="219.99" data-end="222.06">related modules</span> <span data-start="222.06" data-end="225.57">yes Traverse and es Co Jen so so es</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="225.57" data-end="228.09">Traverse is a module for traversing the</span> <span data-start="228.09" data-end="229.56">parse trees that are generated by us</span> <span data-start="229.56" data-end="232.02">prima and es Co gen is for doing code</span> <span data-start="232.02" data-end="233.7">generation from the parse trees and</span> <span data-start="233.7" data-end="235.38">we're gonna use both of these in the</span> <span data-start="235.38" data-end="239.79">examples that I'm going to show you so</span> <span data-start="239.79" data-end="241.2">this is a really really simple example</span> <span data-start="241.2" data-end="243.81">of what you can do with this prima has a</span> <span data-start="243.81" data-end="246.45">nice simple API right we require a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.45" data-end="248.72">Suprema or include the source tag and</span> <span data-start="248.72" data-end="252.24">just call the parse function so this is</span> <span data-start="252.24" data-end="254.37">a very very simple JavaScript program</span> <span data-start="254.37" data-end="255.75">here write a single function that</span> <span data-start="255.75" data-end="261.049">returns a value Esprit MA is going to</span> <span data-start="261.049" data-end="264.09">emit a parse tree that looks something</span> <span data-start="264.09" data-end="265.35">like this this is a bit of a</span> <span data-start="265.35" data-end="268.26">simplification but at the top level we</span> <span data-start="268.26" data-end="270.96">have a program the program consists of</span> <span data-start="270.96" data-end="273.24">one thing a function declaration the</span> <span data-start="273.24" data-end="274.79">function declaration has an identifier</span> <span data-start="274.79" data-end="277.5">the name of the function and it has a</span> <span data-start="277.5" data-end="279.66">body the body has one thing which is a</span> <span data-start="279.66" data-end="282.9">return statement and it returns 42 so</span> <span data-start="282.9" data-end="285.27">this is sort of a simplified version if</span> <span data-start="285.27" data-end="287.639">you want to see it in its full glory</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.639" data-end="288.99">I'm not sure if that's big enough to</span> <span data-start="288.99" data-end="291.99">read but you get the picture it's you</span> <span data-start="291.99" data-end="293.43">know there's a lot of detail there to</span> <span data-start="293.43" data-end="297.689">the parse tree so on its own this is a</span> <span data-start="297.689" data-end="299.49">little bit boring right okay so we parse</span> <span data-start="299.49" data-end="301.08">JavaScript and we get a parse tree who</span> <span data-start="301.08" data-end="304.979">cares but it turns out that if we if we</span> <span data-start="304.979" data-end="306.659">actually do stuff to this parse tree we</span> <span data-start="306.659" data-end="308.669">can we can analyze it and do a lot of</span> <span data-start="308.669" data-end="311.43">useful and really interesting things and</span> <span data-start="311.43" data-end="313.59">I'm going to show a basic example here</span> <span data-start="313.59" data-end="316.86">which is to do a style checker so this</span> <span data-start="316.86" data-end="318.3">is sort of an example of how something</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="323.069">like jslint works and so as Brian</span> <span data-start="323.069" data-end="324.539">mentioned I work on the chrome team at</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="324.539" data-end="326.759">Google and on the chromium project we</span> <span data-start="326.759" data-end="329.789">have style guides and we have a C++</span> <span data-start="329.789" data-end="331.59">style guide and a JavaScript style guide</span> <span data-start="331.59" data-end="334.889">and they're not quite the same variables</span> <span data-start="334.889" data-end="336.599">in C++ have underscores and in</span> <span data-start="336.599" data-end="339.12">JavaScript we use camel case so I find</span> <span data-start="339.12" data-end="340.289">myself getting mixed up sometimes</span> <span data-start="340.289" data-end="342.36">between these style guides and you know</span> <span data-start="342.36" data-end="344.039">really wastes a lot of time in code</span> <span data-start="344.039" data-end="346.08">review when you realize that you used</span> <span data-start="346.08" data-end="347.189">underscores when you should have used</span> <span data-start="347.189" data-end="347.999">camel case</span> <span data-start="347.999" data-end="350.789">so I wrote a style checker that can that</span> <span data-start="350.789" data-end="352.56">I can run is a pre-commit hook to</span> <span data-start="352.56" data-end="353.969">prevent me from making these mistakes</span> <span data-start="353.969" data-end="357.12">and I'll show you just how easy it is to</span> <span data-start="357.12" data-end="360.389">do this with a spray map so that's</span> <span data-start="360.389" data-end="361.919">basically the code right there it's</span> <span data-start="361.919" data-end="364.979">about 15 lines of code and it's really</span> <span data-start="364.979" data-end="367.919">pretty simple so the first thing we do</span> <span data-start="367.919" data-end="371.219">is just call the Esprit ml parse</span> <span data-start="371.219" data-end="374.55">function to to parse the parse the code</span> <span data-start="374.55" data-end="378.439">and get back an abstract syntax tree and</span> <span data-start="378.439" data-end="381.93">then we use the es Traverse module to</span> <span data-start="381.93" data-end="385.68">walk over the syntax tree now yes</span> <span data-start="385.68" data-end="387.27">traverse can basically does a</span> <span data-start="387.27" data-end="390">depth-first traversal of a parse tree</span> <span data-start="390" data-end="393.27">and you can visit each node either on</span> <span data-start="393.27" data-end="395.49">the way down before you visit its sub</span> <span data-start="395.49" data-end="398.129">trees or on the way up and and in this</span> <span data-start="398.129" data-end="399.569">case we're doing it on the way down it's</span> <span data-start="399.569" data-end="402">not really relevant but that's just the</span> <span data-start="402" data-end="406.11">meaning of the enter why we're using</span> <span data-start="406.11" data-end="409.05">enter there so this function that we</span> <span data-start="409.05" data-end="410.189">have here is going to be called for</span> <span data-start="410.189" data-end="411.779">every node and we're just looking for</span> <span data-start="411.779" data-end="414.36">nodes that are variable declarations and</span> <span data-start="414.36" data-end="415.56">when we find that node we're going to</span> <span data-start="415.56" data-end="417.839">call the check variable names function</span> <span data-start="417.839" data-end="421.949">and again this is pretty simple</span> <span data-start="421.949" data-end="424.409">so a variable declaration can have more</span> <span data-start="424.409" data-end="426.179">than one variable that it declares right</span> <span data-start="426.179" data-end="427.229">so we're going to iterate through each</span> <span data-start="427.229" data-end="429.239">of those and we're just gonna call a</span> <span data-start="429.239" data-end="431.729">function for every single one and I'm</span> <span data-start="431.729" data-end="433.559">basically just looking to see if the</span> <span data-start="433.559" data-end="435.239">name of the variable has an underscore</span> <span data-start="435.239" data-end="437.669">in it and if it does that's an error</span> <span data-start="437.669" data-end="439.83">that I want to report so I'm just gonna</span> <span data-start="439.83" data-end="442.649">push this errors object to an array and</span> <span data-start="442.649" data-end="444.539">at the end of the script I report all</span> <span data-start="444.539" data-end="448.319">the errors that were found so that's it</span> <span data-start="448.319" data-end="452.459">really really simple and short now have</span> <span data-start="452.459" data-end="454.229">some sample code here that I want to</span> <span data-start="454.229" data-end="455.969">test against and if I run these scripts</span> <span data-start="455.969" data-end="459.149">on that codes lo and behold it detects</span> <span data-start="459.149" data-end="462.419">the errors and and and spits me out a</span> <span data-start="462.419" data-end="467.309">warning so this is just a really simple</span> <span data-start="467.309" data-end="469.379">example of the kind of style checks you</span> <span data-start="469.379" data-end="472.919">can do as I said you know this is</span> <span data-start="472.919" data-end="476.189">basically the way jslint works and so if</span> <span data-start="476.189" data-end="478.589">you have a style guide in your project</span> <span data-start="478.589" data-end="480.119">you know you could imagine writing a</span> <span data-start="480.119" data-end="481.829">style checker that will check every</span> <span data-start="481.829" data-end="483.719">single aspect of your style guide and</span> <span data-start="483.719" data-end="487.669">it's really not that complicated to do</span> <span data-start="487.669" data-end="491.909">so this is an example of analyzing the</span> <span data-start="491.909" data-end="494.069">parse tree right so we read in the code</span> <span data-start="494.069" data-end="496.199">we analyze the parse tree but we left</span> <span data-start="496.199" data-end="499.319">the original code intact so the next</span> <span data-start="499.319" data-end="501.029">thing I want to do is something a little</span> <span data-start="501.029" data-end="502.8">bit more interesting which is to</span> <span data-start="502.8" data-end="506.36">actually rewrite the source code and</span> <span data-start="506.36" data-end="509.849">what I'm going to do is I find so I find</span> <span data-start="509.849" data-end="511.499">often when I'm developing I'm trying to</span> <span data-start="511.499" data-end="513.389">understand the flow of my code and how</span> <span data-start="513.389" data-end="514.86">it flows between functions and</span> <span data-start="514.86" data-end="516.719">especially if I have a lot of callbacks</span> <span data-start="516.719" data-end="519.329">and we can get really complicated and I</span> <span data-start="519.329" data-end="520.949">like to insert logging statements and</span> <span data-start="520.949" data-end="523.56">probably a lot of people do this but</span> <span data-start="523.56" data-end="525.569">sometimes it's super annoying to have to</span> <span data-start="525.569" data-end="527.339">go and insert logging statements in like</span> <span data-start="527.339" data-end="530.61">10 or 15 different places so I wrote</span> <span data-start="530.61" data-end="533.459">this little script that basically adds</span> <span data-start="533.459" data-end="535.769">logging to every single function in a</span> <span data-start="535.769" data-end="539.67">particular source file and again it's</span> <span data-start="539.67" data-end="543.47">actually surprisingly simple to do this</span> <span data-start="543.47" data-end="546.209">so again we we first take the source</span> <span data-start="546.209" data-end="547.68">code and we parse it into an abstract</span> <span data-start="547.68" data-end="551.309">syntax tree then we're going to walk</span> <span data-start="551.309" data-end="553.529">over that tree and look for particular</span> <span data-start="553.529" data-end="555.48">nodes so this time we're look</span> <span data-start="555.48" data-end="557.839">for function declaration nodes and</span> <span data-start="557.839" data-end="560.699">function expressions and when we find</span> <span data-start="560.699" data-end="562.41">one we just call this this function add</span> <span data-start="562.41" data-end="566.67">before code so this function is a little</span> <span data-start="566.67" data-end="568.5">bit more complex than we had before you</span> <span data-start="568.5" data-end="571.5">know we're not just reporting errors so</span> <span data-start="571.5" data-end="572.79">first we figure out the name of the</span> <span data-start="572.79" data-end="575.76">function and then what I do in the</span> <span data-start="575.76" data-end="579.47">second line here is to build up a string</span> <span data-start="579.47" data-end="581.85">that contains the code that I want to</span> <span data-start="581.85" data-end="583.079">insert at the beginning of every</span> <span data-start="583.079" data-end="584.76">function so it's just a console dot log</span> <span data-start="584.76"
