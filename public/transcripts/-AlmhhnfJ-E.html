data-end="339.83">normal desks and we have some standing</span> <span data-start="339.83" data-end="341.3">desk towards the back and these are</span> <span data-start="341.3" data-end="343.31">becoming more and more common in all</span> <span data-start="343.31" data-end="345.37">workplaces which is really good and</span> <span data-start="345.37" data-end="347.81">here's another good example of a sort of</span> <span data-start="347.81" data-end="351.8">similar mixed office the strange thing</span> <span data-start="351.8" data-end="353.24">is though it's more of a

data-end="379.13">when you try to not do it people are</span> <span data-start="379.13" data-end="383.29">really uncomfortable about it so it's a</span> <span data-start="383.29" data-end="385.94">the cultural shift has changed in that</span> <span data-start="385.94" data-end="387.5">we know we should do it so much but it's</span> <span data-start="387.5" data-end="390.04">still seen as an odd thing to do and</span> <span data-start="390.04" data-end="393.77">which is strange and yeah I still</span> <span data-start="393.77" data-end="395.36">challenge whether you can get as much</span> <span data-start="395.36" data-end="396.98">done standing up or sitting down it's</span> <span data-start="396.98" data-end="399.08">slightly harder and you also notice as</span> <span data-start="399.08" data-end="401.66">we'll come to in a minute it's hard to</span> <span data-start="401.66" data-end="403.79">get posture right as well</span> <span data-start="403.79" data-end="406.91">so it's a tough one but we're it's it's</span> <span data-start="406.91" data-end="408.95">something that more people are open to</span> <span data-start="408.95" data-end="410.81">investigating okay let's get a bit more</span> <span data-start="410.81" data-end="419.51">extreme walking disks this is it's</span> <span data-start="419.51" data-end="421.85">actually become a popular as well less</span> <span data-start="421.85" data-end="423.29">so in Europe and these are</span> <span data-start="423.29" data-end="425.3">professionally available ones I've never</span> <span data-start="425.3" data-end="426.62">been to an office like this this is</span> <span data-start="426.62" data-end="428.57">quite incredible and these are very</span> <span data-start="428.57" data-end="432.2">expensive and you can get some more DIY</span> <span data-start="432.2" data-end="436">options like this and there's plenty of</span> <span data-start="436" data-end="438.41">tutorials on this and this is actually a</span> <span data-start="438.41" data-end="440.6">friend of mine in Croatia this is one he</span> <span data-start="440.6" data-end="444.02">has and I know a guy in Friedrichs rain</span> <span data-start="444.02" data-end="446.24">who's done something very similar and as</span> <span data-start="446.24" data-end="448.1">again you can see you can actually add a</span> <span data-start="448.1" data-end="450.23">chair to it and both the people i know</span> <span data-start="450.23" data-end="453.05">who do this are incredibly thin and look</span> <span data-start="453.05" data-end="455.57">like rakes I don't know if that's good</span> <span data-start="455.57" data-end="460.22">or bad but but so but again variety is</span> <span data-start="460.22" data-end="463.13">kind of the spice of life as we say and</span> <span data-start="463.13" data-end="466.69">there's many ways and things to try now</span> <span data-start="466.69" data-end="469.4">so posture we already had a quick look</span> <span data-start="469.4" data-end="472.1">at that this is a very traditional sort</span> <span data-start="472.1" data-end="475.31">of look at bad posture and coding</span> <span data-start="475.31" data-end="476.72">especially is one of those

data-end="493.79">you suddenly think Oh God what about</span> <span data-start="493.79" data-end="496.67">done to myself and it's very hard to not</span> <span data-start="496.67" data-end="499.28">to it's very hard to avoid these habits</span> <span data-start="499.28" data-end="501.38">sometimes and we all know that we should</span> <span data-start="501.38" data-end="504.35">sit straight relax muscles arm 90</span> <span data-start="504.35" data-end="505.46">degrees and things like that but when</span> <span data-start="505.46" data-end="507.23">you're concentrating it's quite</span> <span data-start="507.23" data-end="508.46">difficult to concentrate on anything</span> <span data-start="508.46" data-end="511.88">else and I have a more amusing picture</span> <span data-start="511.88"

data-end="522.7">out there on things to try and</span> <span data-start="522.7" data-end="525.74">especially in Czech workspaces I think</span> <span data-start="525.74" data-end="529.34">we tend to get better setups but often</span> <span data-start="529.34" data-end="531.29">there's also a conscious decision for</span> <span data-start="531.29" data-end="534.88">you to try and sit better as well and</span> <span data-start="534.88" data-end="538.19">again bad posture can</span> <span data-start="538.19" data-end="542">arm things like blood flow back problems</span> <span data-start="542"
