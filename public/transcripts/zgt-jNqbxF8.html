data-start="22.77" data-end="24.96">code collage which is sort of this kind</span> <span data-start="24.96" data-end="27.71">of pretentious artsy thing cut but I</span> <span data-start="27.71" data-end="30.18">mean what I really want to talk about is</span> <span data-start="30.18" data-end="32.94">UNIX philosophy so this is one of my</span> <span data-start="32.94" data-end="35.219">favorite philosophers it's Diogenes of</span> <span data-start="35.219" data-end="39.09">Tonopah this guy's amazing but there</span> <span data-start="39.09" data-end="42.329">really are these sort of um these higher</span> <span data-start="42.329" data-end="44.85">level kind of platonic forms in code</span> <span data-start="44.85" data-end="48.51">that I think are really amazing and so</span> <span data-start="48.51" data-end="50.79">just a little bit this is the company</span> <span data-start="50.79" data-end="53.88">that started browser lane whoops it's</span> <span data-start="53.88" data-end="55.71">just like a cross browser testing site I</span> <span data-start="55.71" data-end="57.63">mean mostly these days is just to</span> <span data-start="57.63" data-end="61.11">subsidize my experiments but it's we do</span> <span data-start="61.11" data-end="64.079">have a lot of great stuff planned so i</span> <span data-start="64.079" data-end="66.479">was just a lisbon and and this guy max</span> <span data-start="66.479" data-end="72.57">ogden gave people a fish it was really</span> <span data-start="72.57" data-end="74.34">it was really excellent but it got me</span> <span data-start="74.34" data-end="79.02">thinking yeah so max Ogden has this</span> <span data-start="79.02" data-end="81.359">really cool website called call back</span> <span data-start="81.359" data-end="84.749">he'll calm and I think it's a really</span> <span data-start="84.749" data-end="87.329">great example to start this sort of this</span> <span data-start="87.329" data-end="89.549">sort of discourse on what makes good</span> <span data-start="89.549" data-end="92.52">code and what makes good art because</span> <span data-start="92.52" data-end="94.02">there's there's a lot of similarity so</span> <span data-start="94.02" data-end="96.719">for instance if we see some code like</span> <span data-start="96.719" data-end="98.939">this right this is sort of the canonical</span> <span data-start="98.939" data-end="100.319">i took this exactly from his website</span> <span data-start="100.319" data-end="102.499">this is the canonical sort of um</span> <span data-start="102.499" data-end="105.029">terrible callback hell where you just</span> <span data-start="105.029" data-end="107.999">like have this this arrow pointing off</span> <span data-start="107.999" data-end="110.909">to the right in the distance it's it's</span> <span data-start="110.909" data-end="113.749">because we we take our state and we just</span> <span data-start="113.749" data-end="116.789">nested and we keep nesting and we go all</span> <span data-start="116.789" data-end="118.349">the way out and it's totally unreadable</span> <span data-start="118.349" data-end="120.929">but so I wrote a piece of software that</span> <span data-start="120.929" data-end="125.219">lets you take whoops take those and put</span> <span data-start="125.219" data-end="127.499">them in a more of a graphical form so</span> <span data-start="127.499" data-end="128.67">we're not really looking at the code</span> <span data-start="128.67" data-end="130.74">anymore we're looking at sort of a</span> <span data-start="130.74" data-end="132.72">graphical representation of avoided</span> <span data-start="132.72" data-end="136.55">entails so for instance in this it this</span> <span data-start="136.55" data-end="141.3">image viewer thingy gives each nested</span> <span data-start="141.3" data-end="143.67">statement a new color so you see like</span> <span data-start="143.67" data-end="145.5">the banding pattern and the more the</span> <span data-start="145.5" data-end="147.33">more of the color you see the probably</span> <span data-start="147.33" data-end="148.89">the worst the code is so it's</span> <span data-start="148.89" data-end="150.569">it's a great way to sort of visualize a</span> <span data-start="150.569" data-end="155.069">code base on a higher level and so if we</span> <span data-start="155.069" data-end="156.78">go just to the rest of this stuff on</span> <span data-start="156.78" data-end="158.25">call back hell I've got a nice little</span> <span data-start="158.25" data-end="163.14">sequence here for that so here we can we</span> <span data-start="163.14" data-end="167.25">can have a just a simple form and you</span> <span data-start="167.25" data-end="168.959">know we can have this on submit thing</span> <span data-start="168.959" data-end="170.49">that's kind of ugly because it's got you</span> <span data-start="170.49" data-end="174.959">know these nested callbacks in it you</span> <span data-start="174.959" data-end="176.52">can rewrite those so that you actually</span> <span data-start="176.52" data-end="178.08">named your functions and then you can</span> <span data-start="178.08" data-end="179.55">split them out which is really nice</span> <span data-start="179.55" data-end="181.92">because you're you're being explicit but</span> <span data-start="181.92" data-end="184.17">really the really beneficial thing about</span> <span data-start="184.17" data-end="186.9">it is when you start doing modules so if</span> <span data-start="186.9" data-end="188.91">we just could require a module we</span> <span data-start="188.91" data-end="190.47">wouldn't have to do any of that we could</span> <span data-start="190.47" data-end="192">sort of push it off to the side and just</span> <span data-start="192" data-end="194.16">make a module that just does one thing</span> <span data-start="194.16" data-end="195.39">and that's a really important thing in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="195.39" data-end="198.92">UNIX philosophy it's just do one thing</span> <span data-start="198.92" data-end="201.57">ideally exactly one thing unless you</span> <span data-start="201.57" data-end="205.43">can't for whatever external constraint</span> <span data-start="205.43" data-end="209.07">but so you you have a module that looks</span> <span data-start="209.07" data-end="211.11">like this and you like exports submit at</span> <span data-start="211.11" data-end="212.82">the end there or you module that exports</span> <span data-start="212.82" data-end="214.89">and it's really amazing like I've really</span> <span data-start="214.89" data-end="216.75">fell in love with this pattern in node</span> <span data-start="216.75" data-end="218.4">because it means that you can just do</span> <span data-start="218.4" data-end="221.489">one thing really well and then you can</span> <span data-start="221.489" data-end="224.37">share it on NPM and what's really cool</span> <span data-start="224.37" data-end="228.06">also is that when you do that you start</span> <span data-start="228.06" data-end="229.739">like this is the first one right we have</span> <span data-start="229.739" data-end="231.45">we have some nesting we have this color</span> <span data-start="231.45" data-end="233.97">pattern we can you know this is where we</span> <span data-start="233.97" data-end="235.47">name it but that's just an incidental</span> <span data-start="235.47" data-end="237.269">step to get to this point where it's all</span> <span data-start="237.269" data-end="239.04">the same color because we're only ever</span> <span data-start="239.04" data-end="243.36">going one indentation level deep but I</span> <span data-start="243.36" data-end="244.98">think the most important thing also is</span> <span data-start="244.98" data-end="247.2">that you know this none of these pieces</span> <span data-start="247.2" data-end="249.12">are very big either it's you know it's</span> <span data-start="249.12" data-end="251.79">15 20 lines tops and I think that that</span> <span data-start="251.79" data-end="253.41">that is really the sweet spot you know</span> <span data-start="253.41" data-end="255.54">maybe maybe all the way up to 100 lines</span> <span data-start="255.54" data-end="258.18">but not much more than that for</span> <span data-start="258.18" data-end="260.43">modularity and so here's here's both of</span> <span data-start="260.43" data-end="262.169">the pieces of code as the final step so</span> <span data-start="262.169" data-end="263.49">we can actually split things up into</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="265.729">separate modules push them on NPM and</span> <span data-start="265.729" data-end="267.72">it's really great because you go from</span> <span data-start="267.72" data-end="272.789">this to this so we can get a little meta</span> <span data-start="272.789" data-end="275.479">here and actually look at the code that</span> <span data-start="275.479" data-end="280.41">generated this so the first thing as I</span> <span data-start="280.41" data-end="282.87">was creating these examples as well I</span> <span data-start="282.87" data-end="284.76">find myself doing this pattern where I</span> <span data-start="284.76" data-end="286.86">where I call child prostitute spawn all</span> <span data-start="286.86" data-end="289.26">over the place but I typically only want</span> <span data-start="289.26" data-end="291.27">to check the exit status to see if it's</span> <span data-start="291.27" data-end="294.42">if it's nonzero and if it is a nonzero</span> <span data-start="294.42" data-end="296.82">then I want to just like make an error</span> <span data-start="296.82" data-end="298.44">message and put all of the standard</span> <span data-start="298.44" data-end="300.54">error into the error message that would</span> <span data-start="300.54" data-end="302.04">be really handy so that is all of that</span> <span data-start="302.04" data-end="304.26">this function does we can actually zoom</span> <span data-start="304.26" data-end="305.73">out a bit to get more of like the higher</span> <span data-start="305.73" data-end="309.03">level what it's doing it's very short</span> <span data-start="309.03" data-end="311.82">it's let's see it's 47 lines total and</span> <span data-start="311.82" data-end="316.53">so the next piece was well maybe I don't</span> <span data-start="316.53" data-end="318">just want to see one piece of code</span> <span data-start="318" data-end="321.45">rendered I want to see the entire get</span> <span data-start="321.45" data-end="324.51">history rendered animated which i will</span> <span data-start="324.51" data-end="326.88">go to in a second so here I've got the</span> <span data-start="326.88" data-end="331.62">second this second module that just uses</span> <span data-start="331.62" data-end="333.87">the git log command and and parses all</span> <span data-start="333.87" data-end="337.95">of the commits and if I can't quite run</span> <span data-start="337.95" data-end="341.49">that but well so when when all this</span> <span data-start="341.49" data-end="344.34">module does it's one thing is that it</span> <span data-start="344.34" data-end="346.59">just takes get log and it just gives you</span> <span data-start="346.59" data-end="348.63">objects instead of like the standard get</span> <span data-start="348.63" data-end="351.72">format it's very simple and the the</span> <span data-start="351.72" data-end="355.74">final thing that I needed was a module</span> <span data-start="355.74" data-end="357.15">to actually render the things with</span> <span data-start="357.15" data-end="359.01">canvas this one is unfortunately the a</span> <span data-start="359.01" data-end="360.96">bit long it's 108 lines but that's</span> <span data-start="360.96" data-end="362.46">that's sort of the upper bound usually</span> <span data-start="362.46" data-end="365.22">for most of the modules that i make you</span> <span data-start="365.22" data-end="367.43">know it's so it uses a two modules</span> <span data-start="367.43" data-end="370.59">canvas and which is by TJ Holloway chuck</span> <span data-start="370.59" data-end="372.51">is just a wrapper in node for the native</span> <span data-start="372.51" data-end="375.51">canvas browser API and falafel is just a</span> <span data-start="375.51" data-end="377.31">small rapper i wrote around ass prima</span> <span data-start="377.31" data-end="378.66">jeaious which is really great because it</span> <span data-start="378.66" data-end="380.7">lets you take JavaScript parse the</span> <span data-start="380.7" data-end="383.67">abstract syntax tree the ast so that you</span> <span data-start="383.67" data-end="385.29">can get all the tokens and that's how i</span> <span data-start="385.29" data-end="388.05">was doing them like having the different</span> <span data-start="388.05" data-end="389.79">colors for the different bands in the</span> <span data-start="389.79" data-end="394.95">code so the next piece is called get</span> <span data-start="394.95" data-end="396.99">file there's this really excellent</span> <span data-start="396.99" data-end="401.79">command and get called get show and all</span> <span data-start="401.79" data-end="403.8">of all that this file does is it's a</span> <span data-start="403.8" data-end="406.74">really simple wrapper around the get</span> <span data-start="406.74" data-end="408.24">show command and all you do is you</span> <span data-start="408.24" data-end="411.03">specify the commit reference so that</span> <span data-start="411.03" data-end="412.62">could just be a commit hash a colon and</span> <span data-start="412.62" data-end="415.08">the file name and that lets you like go</span> <span
