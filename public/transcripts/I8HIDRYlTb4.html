<p><span data-start="123.719" data-end="127.259">I think the most popular was 1024 or</span> <span data-start="127.259" data-end="131.25">1024 but there are also like like this</span> <span data-start="131.25" data-end="132.349">one</span> <span data-start="132.349" data-end="136.04">which is pretty hard to know which one</span> <span data-start="136.04" data-end="137.81">you have to merge and what it's going to</span> <span data-start="137.81" data-end="141.62">be afterwards but I guess it works so</span> <span data-start="141.62" data-end="143.54">but I'm going to be talking about the</span> <span data-start="143.54" data-end="145.28">simplest implementation that's 2048</span> <span data-start="145.28" data-end="147.2">that's just the basic you can check it</span> <span data-start="147.2" data-end="149.389">out on github and it's free and runs in</span> <span data-start="149.389" data-end="152.75">the browser yeah the I think the most</span> <span data-start="152.75" data-end="154.879">the hardest thing actually</span> <span data-start="154.879" data-end="156.98">while working on it was not to get</span> <span data-start="156.98" data-end="158.54">distracted by the game also often</span> <span data-start="158.54" data-end="160.669">because you're gonna just like I'm going</span> <span data-start="160.669" data-end="162.499">to try this out and suddenly like 10</span> <span data-start="162.499" data-end="163.519">minutes later you realize I've been</span> <span data-start="163.519" data-end="165.079">playing this game for 10 minutes now I</span> <span data-start="165.079" data-end="168.139">should really get to work all right</span> <span data-start="168.139" data-end="170.959">um so let's look at the rules click</span> <span data-start="170.959" data-end="172.549">overview just so we are all on the same</span> <span data-start="172.549" data-end="176.239">page we have a four by four grid I've</span> <span data-start="176.239" data-end="179.629">all seen that and each term basically</span> <span data-start="179.629" data-end="181.849">you take an action which I call alpha</span> <span data-start="181.849" data-end="185.54">here and alpha is zero one two or three</span> <span data-start="185.54" data-end="188.329">so it's one of of this set of numbers</span> <span data-start="188.329" data-end="192.409">and so you take this action and after</span> <span data-start="192.409" data-end="195.29">you've moved the new tire a new toy will</span> <span data-start="195.29" data-end="197.93">edit to an empty space and there is a</span> <span data-start="197.93" data-end="199.669">probability distribution so there's a</span> <span data-start="199.669" data-end="201.979">90% chance that the new tile is going to</span> <span data-start="201.979" data-end="204.829">be 2 and there's a 10% probability that</span> <span data-start="204.829" data-end="206.599">the new tile is gonna before so every</span> <span data-start="206.599" data-end="210.979">time you move you get a new tile if you</span> <span data-start="210.979" data-end="214.459">merge two tiles with the same value then</span> <span data-start="214.459" data-end="217.639">you will get one new tile with the value</span> <span data-start="217.639" data-end="220.069">of the sum of those two tiles I think</span> <span data-start="220.069" data-end="222.019">you you've seen that I just written it</span> <span data-start="222.019" data-end="225.799">up once more so remembered all right and</span> <span data-start="225.799" data-end="228.079">then so basically there are three</span> <span data-start="228.079" data-end="230.209">measurements and how how well you're</span> <span data-start="230.209" data-end="233.15">doing you lose when there are no more</span> <span data-start="233.15" data-end="235.009">moves possible because they were borders</span> <span data-start="235.009" data-end="236.75">full and you can move anywhere to merge</span> <span data-start="236.75" data-end="240.739">anything and you win when you have one</span> <span data-start="240.739" data-end="245.78">tile with 2048 present or let 1024 in</span> <span data-start="245.78" data-end="247.79">the other game or like the rainbow dog</span> <span data-start="247.79" data-end="252.019">with the dog game and then there's</span> <span data-start="252.019" data-end="253.909">additional a thing that's called the</span> <span data-start="253.909" data-end="256.669">score and the score is basically every</span> <span data-start="256.669" data-end="260.51">time you merge two tiles then the sum of</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="262.969">those two tiles the added to the score</span> <span data-start="262.969" data-end="264.62">so basically every time you merge</span> <span data-start="264.62" data-end="265.31">something</span> <span data-start="265.31" data-end="268.22">score gets updated at gets higher so</span> <span data-start="268.22" data-end="271.25">these are the basic set of rules and so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.25" data-end="273.26">I basically just started as thinking</span> <span data-start="273.26" data-end="275.15">okay first thing the most important</span> <span data-start="275.15" data-end="278.389">thing is the name after 2048 of course</span> <span data-start="278.389" data-end="280.55">it's the pun it's a reference to alphago</span> <span data-start="280.55" data-end="282.53">they would stick the most important</span> <span data-start="282.53" data-end="283.85">thing and once I got the name I was like</span> <span data-start="283.85" data-end="284.419">okay mo</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="284.419" data-end="288.56">I'm all set now the second thing was</span> <span data-start="288.56" data-end="290.99">that it has to be JavaScript because I</span> <span data-start="290.99" data-end="293.63">really like JavaScript it's easy to</span> <span data-start="293.63" data-end="295.58">setup it just runs you can run it in the</span> <span data-start="295.58" data-end="297.35">browser you can run with notes so it was</span> <span data-start="297.35" data-end="299.72">just just to simplify things basically</span> <span data-start="299.72" data-end="302.45">and then the other thing was that it</span> <span data-start="302.45" data-end="305.06">needs to be supervised and so basically</span> <span data-start="305.06" data-end="306.56">supervised learning means that I'm</span> <span data-start="306.56" data-end="309.5">teaching my machine something where I</span> <span data-start="309.5" data-end="311.57">already know the correct answer I</span> <span data-start="311.57" data-end="313.46">already know what I want my machine to</span> <span data-start="313.46" data-end="316.16">predict for me so I'm gonna I'm telling</span> <span data-start="316.16" data-end="317.57">my machine ok if you get this set of</span> <span data-start="317.57" data-end="320.33">inputs I'm expecting this output the</span> <span data-start="320.33" data-end="322.97">other thing I'm supervised learning you</span> <span data-start="322.97" data-end="324.77">just tell the machine do you see a</span> <span data-start="324.77" data-end="325.97">pattern here but I don't know the</span> <span data-start="325.97" data-end="328.28">pattern so supervised because we know</span> <span data-start="328.28" data-end="332.84">when we get to 2048 we be win all right</span> <span data-start="332.84" data-end="337.13">so I was I started with a library those</span> <span data-start="337.13" data-end="338.78">of you who see me give the talk last</span> <span data-start="338.78" data-end="340.22">year you already know it it's called</span> <span data-start="340.22" data-end="342.94">synaptic and blue because it's the link</span> <span data-start="342.94" data-end="345.95">and kinetic is a neuro Network library</span> <span data-start="345.95" data-end="351.62">for JavaScript oh yeah so I don't know</span> <span data-start="351.62" data-end="352.94">neuro networks I think you've heard of</span> <span data-start="352.94" data-end="354.68">it I'm not going to explain it it's just</span> <span data-start="354.68" data-end="356.72">it's doing machine learning magic that's</span> <span data-start="356.72" data-end="358.21">why I don't know</span> <span data-start="358.21" data-end="364.51">and so the what synaptic does is does</span> <span data-start="364.51" data-end="367.16">classification which means it classifies</span> <span data-start="367.16" data-end="369.979">words in the end you get either either 0</span> <span data-start="369.979" data-end="372.62">or 1 for whatever you want to predict so</span> <span data-start="372.62" data-end="375.86">you can't predict numbers per se that</span> <span data-start="375.86" data-end="377.9">would be called regression so you can't</span> <span data-start="377.9" data-end="379.91">predict like if I make this move what</span> <span data-start="379.91" data-end="381.77">will my score be so it has to be</span> <span data-start="381.77" data-end="383.51">something the thing you want to predict</span> <span data-start="383.51" data-end="386.68">has to be something between 0 or 1 or</span> <span data-start="386.68" data-end="390.47">true or false respectively so yeah and</span> <span data-start="390.47" data-end="393.409">then of course I have prior experience</span> <span data-start="393.409" data-end="396.05">with synaptic that's also linked to the</span> <span data-start="396.05" data-end="398.15">product I showed last year it was</span> <span data-start="398.15" data-end="402.8">a soccer result predictor thing so that</span> <span data-start="402.8" data-end="405.05">was basically the reasons why child with</span> <span data-start="405.05" data-end="407.15">synaptic I already knew everything and</span> <span data-start="407.15" data-end="408.92">then yeah I had a pretty good idea what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="408.92" data-end="415.81">I wanted to so um yeah first iteration</span> <span data-start="415.81" data-end="419.78">so first I'm basically trying to sign</span> <span data-start="419.78" data-end="423.17">out what is it that I want to do</span> <span data-start="423.17" data-end="425.48">actually what is it that I want to teach</span> <span data-start="425.48" data-end="427.79">my machine or what what is the first</span> <span data-start="427.79" data-end="429.08">step I need to do right now</span> <span data-start="429.08" data-end="431.96">so the first step I thought for gather</span> <span data-start="431.96" data-end="435.32">data we I need some kind of data and the</span> <span data-start="435.32" data-end="438.95">idea was that basically you I try to</span> <span data-start="438.95" data-end="442.67">predict the next the best possible move</span> <span data-start="442.67" data-end="446.12">for every turn basically so the way I</span> <span data-start="446.12" data-end="450.41">went to do that was to simulate all</span> <span data-start="450.41" data-end="453.2">actions so if I have a board say let's</span> <span data-start="453.2" data-end="454.7">say that's the first day that I've and</span> <span data-start="454.7" data-end="456.47">starting to play the game then I'm going</span> <span data-start="456.47" data-end="459.5">to simulate all possible actions so four</span> <span data-start="459.5" data-end="462.35">of them and then afterwards I'm going to</span> <span data-start="462.35" data-end="464.72">check dipper score increase so basically</span> <span data-start="464.72" data-end="466.19">when I swipe left with the score</span> <span data-start="466.19" data-end="467.87">increase when I swipe up to the score</span> <span data-start="467.87" data-end="470.75">increase blah blah blah and then after I</span> <span data-start="470.75" data-end="473.96">did that I actually just made a random</span> <span data-start="473.96" data-end="476.21">move for the game so first I simulate</span> <span data-start="476.21" data-end="478.88">and then I just make a random move I</span> <span data-start="478.88" data-end="480.71">could have of course just checked where</span> <span data-start="480.71" data-end="482.24">does the score increase and make that</span> <span data-start="482.24" data-end="483.98">move but I wanted to start random</span> <span data-start="483.98" data-end="486.8">because I wanted to see how well my</span> <span data-start="486.8" data-end="490.7">algorithm basically performed against</span> <span data-start="490.7" data-end="493.04">this randomly moving and you would be</span> <span data-start="493.04" data-end="494.9">surprised if it will random move you</span> <span data-start="494.9" data-end="498.44">will get to like 256 every tenth time so</span> <span data-start="498.44" data-end="500.54">like you can just play it randomly don't</span> <span data-start="500.54" data-end="504.47">look at it it's pretty good so um yeah</span> <span data-start="504.47" data-end="506.24">this is basically what my data set</span> <span data-start="506.24" data-end="509.87">looked like board state was my input</span> <span data-start="509.87" data-end="512.78">that's a serialized state of the board</span> <span data-start="512.78" data-end="516.2">so I just have like I just I count from</span> <span data-start="516.2" data-end="519.35">left upper left to down right basically</span> <span data-start="519.35" data-end="521.12">and then it's zero to zero I don't know</span> <span data-start="521.12" data-end="523.76">one and then just goes on as this is a</span> <span data-start="523.76" data-end="527.24">16 different element of course and the</span> <span data-start="527.24" data-end="530.59">actions those are basically bulls that</span> <span data-start="530.59" data-end="533.17">say if the score has increased after</span> <span data-start="533.17" data-end="535.029">making this value so basically I'm</span> <span data-start="535.029" data-end="536.71">saying I have this board state right now</span> <span data-start="536.71" data-end="540.73">and for each action I took this is what</span> <span data-start="540.73" data-end="542.98">happened to the score zero is the score</span> <span data-start="542.98" data-end="544.87">didn't increase one means that a score</span> <span data-start="544.87" data-end="548.44">increased so I guess that's pretty clear</span> <span data-start="548.44" data-end="552.73">what I mean yes okay all right so I</span> <span data-start="552.73" data-end="554.86">played I like I know I similar they're</span> <span data-start="554.86" data-end="558.94">like 100 games or so and then I was like</span> <span data-start="558.94" data-end="561.13">okay I have I have data now I think</span> <span data-start="561.13" data-end="563.56">that's going to going to give me like a</span> <span data-start="563.56" data-end="567.339">good indicator whether my idea is</span> <span data-start="567.339" data-end="573.19">working on so second iteration this time</span> <span data-start="573.19" data-end="575.589">the goal was to compare the trend</span> <span data-start="575.589" data-end="578.32">network with the unfriend or with a</span> <span data-start="578.32" data-end="581.95">random decision maker and so of course</span> <span data-start="581.95" data-end="583.66">the first thing I need to do is train a</span> <span data-start="583.66" data-end="586.69">neural network and basically the way you</span> <span data-start="586.69" data-end="588.58">go about training a neural network is</span> <span data-start="588.58" data-end="590.2">just give it the input give it the</span> <span data-start="590.2" data-end="592.66">output and then let it run a lot of time</span> <span data-start="592.66" data-end="596.77">so it

<p><span data-start="757.779" data-end="760.27">Markov chain the Markov chain is</span> <span data-start="760.27" data-end="762.91">basically it is a defined chain of</span> <span data-start="762.91" data-end="764.589">states and actions so you have a state</span> <span data-start="764.589" data-end="766.87">and that state has one possible action</span> <span data-start="766.87" data-end="768.79">then it will lead you to another state</span> <span data-start="768.79" data-end="770.89">and that's it will have another possible</span> <span data-start="770.89" data-end="773.14">action it's a stochastic model so</span> <span data-start="773.14" data-end="776.68">there's like the one action that it's</span> <span data-start="776.68" data-end="778.48">going to take is like the one that is</span> <span data-start="778.48" data-end="782.44">probably probable if the higher has the</span> <span data-start="782.44" data-end="784.57">highest probability of being

chain</span> <span data-start="789.49" data-end="790.85">has already existed from</span> <span data-start="790.85" data-end="792.679">from the beginning and the Markov</span> <span data-start="792.679" data-end="794.089">decision process is basically an</span> <span data-start="794.089" data-end="797.239">enhancement of that chain so it if you</span> <span data-start="797.239" data-end="799.939">take if we take a decision process you</span> <span data-start="799.939" data-end="802.759">have the rewards and the end and you</span> <span data-start="802.759" data-end="806.629">have possible directions and the</span> <span data-start="806.629" data-end="808.759">decision process basically decides which</span> <span data-start="808.759" data-end="812.689">action is going to take or if you say</span> <span data-start="812.689" data-end="814.429">the other way around if you take a mark</span> <span data-start="814.429" data-end="817.279">of the certain process and only give the</span> <span data-start="817.279" data-end="820.819">reward 0 and if you only have one action</span> <span data-start="820.819" data-end="822.319">then it's the same as a Markov chain</span> <span data-start="822.319" data-end="827.299">that's basically the the thing then the</span> <span data-start="827.299" data-end="829.459">other nice thing for reinforcement</span> <span data-start="829.459" data-end="830.839">learning is that it can deal with the</span> <span data-start="830.839" data-end="832.579">delayed reward so you can have a lot of</span> <span data-start="832.579" data-end="835.009">states and actions and then give a</span> <span data-start="835.009" data-end="837.199">reward at the end of the of the chain</span> <span data-start="837.199" data-end="839.749">basically that's nice because then you</span> <span data-start="839.749" data-end="841.429">can tell your system that this is like a</span> <span data-start="841.429" data-end="843.829">chain and then in the end the end of</span> <span data-start="843.829" data-end="847.249">that thing that actually matters so this</span> <span data-start="847.249" data-end="849.589">is actually perfect for games or for my</span> <span data-start="849.589" data-end="854.839">case and so the one thing that is</span> <span data-start="854.839" data-end="856.549">basically the the challenge of</span> <span data-start="856.549" data-end="859.789">reinforcement learning is exploration</span> <span data-start="859.789" data-end="862.729">versus exploitation and what that means</span> <span data-start="862.729" data-end="866.769">is that so on the one hand all the</span> <span data-start="866.769" data-end="868.85">experience that your machine gets</span> <span data-start="868.85" data-end="871.489">especially from the machine playing so</span> <span data-start="871.489" data-end="874.879">it plays and while it plays it learns so</span> <span data-start="874.879" data-end="876.319">you want to have a lot of different</span> <span data-start="876.319" data-end="878.509">kinds of datasets so it will learn new</span> <span data-start="878.509" data-end="880.22">stuff we learn different stuff learn</span> <span data-start="880.22" data-end="882.559">different ways to go but on the other</span> <span data-start="882.559" data-end="884.689">hand you also want your machine to do</span> <span data-start="884.689" data-end="886.279">the best possible moves that are knows</span> <span data-start="886.279" data-end="887.809">of so you got to balance those things</span> <span data-start="887.809" data-end="890.779">like just don't be too random but also</span> <span data-start="890.779" data-end="893.029">don't only stick to the stuff you</span> <span data-start="893.029" data-end="898.489">already know all right and then there's</span> <span data-start="898.489" data-end="900.829">some another machine learning method</span> <span data-start="900.829" data-end="903.379">that's more it's like more concrete and</span> <span data-start="903.379" data-end="905.6">also something that is basically perfect</span> <span data-start="905.6" data-end="908.179">for my use case it's called temporal</span> <span data-start="908.179" data-end="912.199">difference learning and the thing about</span> <span data-start="912.199" data-end="913.579">temporal distance learning is basically</span> <span data-start="913.579" data-end="915.949">that is it knows that there is a state</span> <span data-start="915.949" data-end="917.569">in the end and there are states and</span> <span data-start="917.569" data-end="919.43">actions that precede this end</span> <span data-start="919.43" data-end="922.04">and it will slowly learn how those</span> <span data-start="922.04" data-end="925.22">states before can influence the state in</span> <span data-start="925.22" data-end="927.83">the end and also get that maybe he liked</span> <span data-start="927.83" data-end="929.66">the the begins there's a pretty</span> <span data-start="929.66" data-end="931.91">important which moves you make but the</span> <span data-start="931.91" data-end="934.22">the the ones to what the end are not as</span> <span data-start="934.22" data-end="936.74">important anymore so those are things</span> <span data-start="936.74" data-end="938.42">that the temporal difference learning</span> <span data-start="938.42" data-end="942.26">deals with and there's also two</span> <span data-start="942.26" data-end="946.55">basically two strategies you need to</span> <span data-start="946.55" data-end="948.62">understand the first one is dynamic</span> <span data-start="948.62" data-end="951.86">programming so utilize dynamic</span> <span data-start="951.86" data-end="953.42">programming which basically just means</span> <span data-start="953.42" data-end="955.19">dividing your big problem into</span> <span data-start="955.19" data-end="957.38">subproblems so you have like this whole</span> <span data-start="957.38" data-end="958.67">chain and you're dividing it into</span> <span data-start="958.67" data-end="962.2">smaller units of problems to solve and</span> <span data-start="962.2" data-end="964.79">the other thing that it makes use of is</span> <span data-start="964.79" data-end="968.33">called the Monte Carlo method the Monte</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.33" data-end="970.49">Carlo method is is a heuristic search</span> <span data-start="970.49" data-end="973.61">tree more or less you have like a tree</span> <span data-start="973.61" data-end="976.339">where you say okay from this stage I</span> <span data-start="976.339" data-end="978.14">have four different actions and this</span> <span data-start="978.14" data-end="979.85">will lead me to this state and so on and</span> <span data-start="979.85" data-end="981.83">so on and at the end of the tree you</span> <span data-start="981.83" data-end="985.49">have values which are our rewards so</span> <span data-start="985.49" data-end="990.05">every time we tell our algorithm to</span> <span data-start="990.05" data-end="991.97">predict something it will look into the</span> <span data-start="991.97" data-end="994.82">tree and look basically do I have a</span> <span data-start="994.82" data-end="997.31">reward for this exact scenario if not</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="997.31" data-end="999.2">I'm going to choose a scenario that is</span> <span data-start="999.2" data-end="1001.9">close to it and has give me a high value</span> <span data-start="1001.9" data-end="1003.85">so basically what temporal disinterring</span> <span data-start="1003.85" data-end="1007.6">does is it combines a heuristic like</span> <span data-start="1007.6" data-end="1010.87">search algorithm with machine learning</span> <span data-start="1010.87" data-end="1013.42">because it does if it doesn't find the</span> <span data-start="1013.42" data-end="1016.42">exact reward it will approximate it by</span> <span data-start="1016.42" data-end="1019.089">the other data it already has and it's</span> <span data-start="1019.089" data-end="1023.11">also ha alphago did a lot of stuff all</span> <span data-start="1023.11" data-end="1023.32">right</span> <span data-start="1023.32" data-end="1027.13">and so I googled like any good developer</span> <span data-start="1027.13" data-end="1029.949">would do and what I found was a library</span> <span data-start="1029.949" data-end="1031.78">called reinforced days yes there is</span> <span data-start="1031.78" data-end="1034.449">actually a reinforcement library for</span> </p>

that's basically the code so</span> <span data-start="1073.3" data-end="1076.93">you have the state but before it's a</span> <span data-start="1076.93" data-end="1080.02">civilized state then you ask

data-end="1236.629">doesn't I'm sorry okay okay well this</span> <span data-start="1236.629" data-end="1241.429">one working very well so you didn't see</span> <span data-start="1241.429"

data-end="1252.889">just started the game the rating is two</span> <span data-start="1252.889" data-end="1255.529">point five because we have some the some</span> <span data-start="1255.529"

data-end="1270.049">into a 4 and the 4 that I that has a</span> <span data-start="1270.049" data-end="1272.24">green frame is the new 4 so this is a</span> <span data-start="1272.24"

data-end="1280.159">we have now is we have a score of 4</span> <span data-start="1280.159" data-end="1282.679">because we merged those twos and we have</span> <span data-start="1282.679"

data-end="1305.53">the bottom row and the fourth new of</span> <span data-start="1305.53" data-end="1308.08">course and now this time we have a score</span> <span data-start="1308.08" data-end="1310.21">of zero and the ratings two point eight</span> <span data-start="1310.21" data-end="1311.98">so the rating has changed the score</span> <span data-start="1311.98" data-end="1314.98">hasn't changed so that was basically my</span> <span data-start="1314.98" data-end="1317.08">idea was well it's a little bit</span> <span data-start="1317.08" data-end="1320.08">different and so maybe that might be</span> <span data-start="1320.08" data-end="1322.45">better for some reasons I wasn't</span> <span data-start="1322.45" data-end="1324.1">entirely sure I just want to try</span> <span data-start="1324.1" data-end="1327.19">something else also it's thinking if you</span> <span data-start="1327.19" data-end="1329.02">don't win because in the end it's about</span> <span data-start="1329.02" data-end="1330.88">do you win the game until you lose the</span> <span data-start="1330.88" data-end="1335.11">game and if like all the games you play</span> <span data-start="1335.11" data-end="1337.48">are basically all losers then there's</span> <span data-start="1337.48" data-end="1339.49">really no point in giving the reward</span> <span data-start="1339.49" data-end="1341.47">back because always the same reward as</span> <span data-start="1341.47" data-end="1344.11">thinking the next best thing is the</span> <span data-start="1344.11" data-end="1347.5">highest sum of tires but with the lowest</span> <span data-start="1347.5" data-end="1349.33">number of tires that's basically if you</span> <span data-start="1349.33" data-end="1352.45">just look at one single stage one that</span> <span data-start="1352.45" data-end="1355.06">has like a higher value but lowers low</span> <span data-start="1355.06" data-end="1357.22">lower number of tires would be better</span> <span data-start="1357.22" data-end="1359.89">than a board with a lot of numbers that</span> <span data-start="1359.89" data-end="1362.77">they're all like two or four okay so</span> <span data-start="1362.77" data-end="1365.05">this was the idea behind the rating I</span> <span data-start="1365.05" data-end="1367.39">tried it it wasn't that great it kind of</span> <span data-start="1367.39" data-end="1369.22">looked like the score before so I tried</span> <span data-start="1369.22" data-end="1373.06">other things and I came up with this</span> <span data-start="1373.06" data-end="1375.31">where the reward was basically the score</span> <span data-start="1375.31" data-end="1377.23">divided by the ever score times the</span> <span data-start="1377.23" data-end="1379.15">rating divided by the average rating and</span> <span data-start="1379.15" data-end="1382.03">the ever which was taken from the last</span> <span data-start="1382.03"

data-end="1388.92">if there is a tendency so that we can</span> <span data-start="1388.92" data-end="1395.32">use it all right and so then what I was</span> <span data-start="1395.32" data-end="1398.2">seeing there was basically that okay the</span> <span data-start="1398.2" data-end="1401.26">yellow line always looks like it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1401.26" data-end="1404.47">move but that's because the values are</span> <span data-start="1404.47" data-end="1406.48">pretty high up there it goes of five</span> <span data-start="1406.48" data-end="1409.42">point five almost so um but if we look</span> <span data-start="1409.42" data-end="1412">at the average okay I was shaking a</span> <span data-start="1412" data-end="1414.67">little bit because I increase the time</span> <span data-start="1414.67" data-end="1418.12">so it's like one value per hour but that</span> <span data-start="1418.12" data-end="1421.15">was just so I could see does that is</span> <span data-start="1421.15" data-end="1423.49">there anything happening and it looks</span> <span data-start="1423.49" data-end="1425.59">like actually there is some intelligence</span> <span data-start="1425.59" data-end="1427.8">that like the score does go up over time</span> <span data-start="1427.8" data-end="1429.82">which could be an indicator that we're</span> <span data-start="1429.82" data-end="1432.4">getting better but I'm not pretty sure</span> <span data-start="1432.4" data-end="1434.36">because as we've seen before</span> <span data-start="1434.36" data-end="1436.25">sometimes there is like a really high</span> <span data-start="1436.25" data-end="1437.86">peak but then it like drops down</span> <span data-start="1437.86" data-end="1441.62">immensely so I would have to run it even</span> <span data-start="1441.62" data-end="1444.56">longer I used to run during the night I</span> <span data-start="1444.56" data-end="1447.23">thought it would be an ass but I'm not</span> <span data-start="1447.23" data-end="1450.44">entirely sure now so gotta try for a</span> <span data-start="1450.44" data-end="1452.65">longer time maybe train for a few days</span> <span data-start="1452.65" data-end="1455.3">but there was something where I thought</span> <span data-start="1455.3" data-end="1457.28">okay this reward seems to be working</span> <span data-start="1457.28" data-end="1459.23">better than just the score so maybe I</span> <span data-start="1459.23" data-end="1460.82">leave the reward for now and then try</span> <span data-start="1460.82" data-end="1463.28">something else and then see how that</span> <span data-start="1463.28" data-end="1467.53">works and so I did a third iteration</span> <span data-start="1467.53" data-end="1472.34">okay okay I did a third iteration where</span> </p>

<span data-start="1738.659" data-end="1741.269">the low epsilon means not as random high</span> <span data-start="1741.269" data-end="1743.399">as long means very random there's this</span> <span data-start="1743.399" data-end="1746.25">gamma thing that's also some kind of</span> <span data-start="1746.25" data-end="1749.429">greedy so if you're if you have low</span> <span data-start="1749.429" data-end="1752.789">gamma and that means that you try to get</span> <span data-start="1752.789" data-end="1755.61">the best possible reward instantly and</span> <span data-start="1755.61" data-end="1757.59">if you have a higher gamma you'll be</span> <span data-start="1757.59" data-end="1760.649">fine with doing a lot of stuff to get a</span> <span data-start="1760.649" data-end="1762.899">higher reward in the end so that's</span> <span data-start="1762.899" data-end="1764.159">something that you can play around with</span> <span data-start="1764.159" data-end="1766.139">there's a learning rate which you can</span> <span data-start="1766.139" data-end="1768.63">just try an error and try to find the</span> <span data-start="1768.63" data-end="1769.289">best thing</span> <span data-start="1769.289" data-end="1771.179">there's experience that you can make it</span> <span data-start="1771.179" data-end="1775.07">bigger whatever there's all kinds of</span> <span data-start="1775.07" data-end="1777.24">parameters and you can if you want to</span> <span data-start="1777.24" data-end="1779.49">get more into it you can check out</span> <span data-start="1779.49" data-end="1781.889">reinforced yes and they're explained in</span> <span data-start="1781.889" data-end="1785.37">a in a nice mathematical way which I</span> <span data-start="1785.37" data-end="1786.809">didn't include because it's kind of</span> <span data-start="1786.809" data-end="1787.35">complicated</span> <span data-start="1787.35" data-end="1790.919">and what else so I was thinking to</span> <span data-start="1790.919" data-end="1792.899">switch to Python Python has a lot of</span> <span data-start="1792.899" data-end="1795.51">nice machine learning frameworks and I</span> <span data-start="1795.51" data-end="1798.029">would be able to just do more to have</span> <span data-start="1798.029" data-end="1800.13">introduced more layers to try around a</span> <span data-start="1800.13" data-end="1802.44">little bit so that could also be</span> <span data-start="1802.44" data-end="1803.909">possible but then I couldn't run in the</span> <span data-start="1803.909" data-end="1805.59">browser so I haven't really decided on</span> <span data-start="1805.59" data-end="1808.289">that yet but one thing I could do is</span> <span data-start="1808.289" data-end="1810.389">something called convolutional net work</span> <span data-start="1810.389" data-end="1812.19">and the convolutional network is</span> <span data-start="1812.19" data-end="1815.82">basically a way for me to to tackle the</span> <span data-start="1815.82" data-end="1817.35">sled input problem because in a</span> <span data-start="1817.35" data-end="1818.96">convolutional network you could like</span> <span data-start="1818.96" data-end="1822.48">have four different nodes and each node</span> <span data-start="1822.48" data-end="1824.88">gets like one row or we have eight</span> <span data-start="1824.88" data-end="1826.71">different notes and then you have four</span> <span data-start="1826.71" data-end="1828.69">four rows and four four columns and they</span> <span data-start="1828.69" data-end="1831.09">will give all their values that they</span> <span data-start="1831.09" data-end="1832.93">calculated and give it to the net</span> <span data-start="1832.93" data-end="1834.76">network so that you can actually have</span> <span data-start="1834.76" data-end="1838.54">those kinds of relationships in the</span> <span data-start="1838.54" data-end="1840.76">horizontal relationships and vertical</span> <span data-start="1840.76" data-end="1842.35">relationships and the system book will</span> <span data-start="1842.35" data-end="1847.18">learn that yeah that's basically it so</span> <span data-start="1847.18" data-end="1848.98">that's basically what I what I did and</span> <span data-start="1848.98" data-end="1851.23">there are some links if you're</span> <span data-start="1851.23" data-end="1854.32">interested so the first one is open</span> <span data-start="1854.32" data-end="1856.57">source 2048 that's the game then there's</span> <span data-start="1856.57" data-end="1859.69">this unlife I didn't notice</span> <span data-start="1859.69" data-end="1862.39">so this is a paper where someone already</span> <span data-start="1862.39" data-end="1864.76">tried to do debrie enforcement learning</span> <span data-start="1864.76" data-end="1867.61">with Python will for the 2048 game I</span> <span data-start="1867.61" data-end="1871.18">think he just rewarded wins with won and</span> <span data-start="1871.18" data-end="1873.16">lost was with zero and said it didn't</span> <span data-start="1873.16" data-end="1876.22">work so well so you can look into it</span> <span data-start="1876.22" data-end="1877.87">what he did and it's pretty interesting</span> <span data-start="1877.87" data-end="1879.76">actually and then there's this</span> <span data-start="1879.76" data-end="1881.29">introduction to Temple distance learning</span> <span data-start="1881.29" data-end="1884.47">that's that's more of a scientific paper</span> <span data-start="1884.47" data-end="1886.48">but it's pretty it's still you can still</span> <span data-start="1886.48" data-end="1890.17">understand it and just for if I didn't</span> <span data-start="1890.17" data-end="1891.61">explain anything to well then maybe you</span> <span data-start="1891.61" data-end="1894.31">can look it up there and then yeah I can</span> <span data-start="1894.31" data-end="1896.71">presentation review address great</span> <span data-start="1896.71" data-end="1903.25">so um live demo so I will show you stuff</span> <span data-start="1903.25" data-end="1905.38">that I so I will let it run in the</span> <span data-start="1905.38" data-end="1909.04">backend I'm not gonna promise anything I</span> <span data-start="1909.04" data-end="1910.74">don't think it will do anything actually</span> <span data-start="1910.74" data-end="1913.81">but it's very hypnotic and it's it's</span> <span data-start="1913.81" data-end="1919.47">nice so I don't know it won't start</span> <span data-start="1919.47" data-end="1924.94">ok so if you have any questions now's</span> <span data-start="1924.94" data-end="1931.56">the time Thanks</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1931.57" data-end="1940.42">I know yeah it's really hard to actually</span> <span data-start="1940.42" data-end="1941.8">that's like I said it's the hardest</span> <span data-start="1941.8" data-end="1943.72">thing and then you you like you start</span> <span data-start="1943.72" data-end="1946.06">the bot and like prepare for bed and</span> <span data-start="1946.06" data-end="1947.68">then you sit in front of it and just</span> <span data-start="1947.68" data-end="1949.48">like oh yeah move it to the left</span> <span data-start="1949.48" data-end="1954.34">yes came after to the left does anyone</span> <span data-start="1954.34" data-end="1974.169">have any questions well yes</span> </p>
