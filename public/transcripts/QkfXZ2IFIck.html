data-start="689.55" data-end="695.73">to check out another commit and now in</span> <span data-start="695.73" data-end="698.07">our main process code we're also going</span> <span data-start="698.07" data-end="699.96">to use a tray module provided by</span> <span data-start="699.96" data-end="705.3">electron and this this module will place</span> <span data-start="705.3" data-end="709.17">an icon in our menu bar so on Mac it's</span> <span data-start="709.17" data-end="711.18">going to be on the top right if I was on</span> <span data-start="711.18" data-end="712.47">a Windows machine it would be on the</span> <span data-start="712.47" data-end="716.58">bottom right and we're going to use this</span> <span data-start="716.58" data-end="719.16">electron positioner module to place our</span> <span data-start="719.16" data-end="721.82">browser window right underneath the icon</span> <span data-start="721.82" data-end="723.96">what I want to point out about this is</span> <span data-start="723.96" data-end="726.06">this is actually a third-party module is</span> <span data-start="726.06" data-end="728.67">created by someone out in the community</span> <span data-start="728.67" data-end="730.56">it's not created by an electron team</span> <span data-start="730.56" data-end="734.67">member and like Adam is open sourced and</span> <span data-start="734.67" data-end="737.34">has a thriving open source community</span> <span data-start="737.34" data-end="740.46">electron does as well and there are a</span> <span data-start="740.46" data-end="743.31">lot of great packages out there electron</span> <span data-start="743.31" data-end="745.71">actually has over 400 open-source</span> <span data-start="745.71" data-end="749.82">contributors at this point so we're</span> <span data-start="749.82" data-end="753.06">going to use this awesome module I think</span> <span data-start="753.06" data-end="758.1">it's made by yawns and Sweden and now</span> <span data-start="758.1" data-end="760.05">when our app is ready we're instead of</span> <span data-start="760.05" data-end="761.43">creating window we're going to create a</span> <span data-start="761.43" data-end="765">tray icon will pass the path to the icon</span> <span data-start="765" data-end="768.66">and when we click on the the icon we're</span> <span data-start="768.66" data-end="770.1">going to toggle the visibility of our</span> <span data-start="770.1" data-end="773.25">window an electron provides us the tray</span> <span data-start="773.25" data-end="774.93">bounds so that we know exactly where on</span> <span data-start="774.93" data-end="776.31">the screen the icon is and we can</span> <span data-start="776.31" data-end="778.5">position our window accordingly so we'll</span> <span data-start="778.5" data-end="781.08">pass those through down to show window</span> <span data-start="781.08" data-end="784.41">and use the positioner module to</span> <span data-start="784.41" data-end="786.78">calculate the position to set our main</span> <span data-start="786.78" data-end="789.66">window at and then we'll show the window</span> <span data-start="789.66" data-end="794.07">and focus it and now when we create our</span> <span data-start="794.07" data-end="795.84">window in addition to specifying the</span> <span data-start="795.84" data-end="798.24">dimensions we're also going to indicate</span> <span data-start="798.24" data-end="799.77">that we want it to be hidden at first</span> <span data-start="799.77" data-end="803.22">and we want it to be frameless and we</span> <span data-start="803.22" data-end="805.86">won't be allowing the user to fullscreen</span> <span data-start="805.86" data-end="806.86">the window</span> <span data-start="806.86" data-end="811.09">or resize it and when we click away from</span> <span data-start="811.09" data-end="812.41">the window and we get the blur event</span> <span data-start="812.41" data-end="816.13">we're going to hide it and lastly we're</span> <span data-start="816.13" data-end="817.87">going to hide the dock icon that would</span> <span data-start="817.87" data-end="822.64">normally appear on a Mac so let's start</span> <span data-start="822.64" data-end="826.69">this up again and you can see now we</span> <span data-start="826.69" data-end="830.38">have a little bb-8 icon up in our menu</span> <span data-start="830.38" data-end="834.16">bar and we can click on him to toggle</span> <span data-start="834.16" data-end="839.95">the visibility and still the dev tools</span> <span data-start="839.95" data-end="842.56">so you'll notice that i restarted the</span> <span data-start="842.56" data-end="846.07">app entirely and one thing to recognize</span> <span data-start="846.07" data-end="848.5">is when you're working with electron</span> <span data-start="848.5" data-end="850.63">apps if you change any of the code in</span> <span data-start="850.63" data-end="853.42">your main process code you're going to</span> <span data-start="853.42" data-end="856.03">need to restart the app entirely this is</span> <span data-start="856.03" data-end="859.05">because that code is loaded into memory</span> <span data-start="859.05" data-end="861.73">upon initialization when you first start</span> <span data-start="861.73" data-end="864.67">electron or as if we'd only changed code</span> <span data-start="864.67" data-end="867.13">in the renderer process then all we</span> <span data-start="867.13" data-end="869.26">would need to do is refresh to see those</span> <span data-start="869.26" data-end="874.44">changes as is the case with any web page</span> <span data-start="874.44" data-end="878.59">so now we have a menu bar app it's</span> <span data-start="878.59" data-end="881.44">pretty plain so we're going to throw</span> <span data-start="881.44" data-end="884.86">some styles at it and I'll check out</span> <span data-start="884.86" data-end="890.95">another commit and now when we click on</span> <span data-start="890.95" data-end="892.18">the app will see that we've turned our</span> <span data-start="892.18" data-end="897.4">hello world app into a Hello bb-8 app so</span> <span data-start="897.4" data-end="900.64">we want to do bb-8 justice here okay so</span> <span data-start="900.64" data-end="903.01">now the exciting part we're going to</span> <span data-start="903.01" data-end="905.29">hook everything up so that when we click</span> <span data-start="905.29" data-end="908.83">a button on our UI that ultimately ends</span> <span data-start="908.83" data-end="912.85">up and bb-8 here doing a little dance so</span> <span data-start="912.85" data-end="917.08">and if you recall we communicate between</span> <span data-start="917.08" data-end="922.12">processes through IPC so now we've added</span> <span data-start="922.12" data-end="925.93">a button in our index dot HTML and has</span> <span data-start="925.93" data-end="928.33">an ID of dance and in our render process</span> <span data-start="928.33" data-end="933.64">code we add a listener that uses the IPC</span> <span data-start="933.64" data-end="935.05">renderer module that we get from</span> <span data-start="935.05" data-end="938.62">electron and we send a dance message</span> <span data-start="938.62" data-end="940.48">over to the main process</span> <span data-start="940.48" data-end="945.37">and in our main process code once the</span> <span data-start="945.37" data-end="947.079">app is ready now we're going to use the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="947.079" data-end="949.69">APC main module from electron and when</span> <span data-start="949.69" data-end="952.089">we receive the dance message will have</span> <span data-start="952.089" data-end="955.209">bb-8 do a dance so now the question is</span> <span data-start="955.209" data-end="959.5">how do we hook up bb-8 and for that</span> <span data-start="959.5" data-end="963.25">we'll check out another commit so bb-8</span> <span data-start="963.25" data-end="966.94">here is built by Sphero and Sphero has a</span> <span data-start="966.94" data-end="971.29">handy node module that we use it uses a</span> <span data-start="971.29" data-end="975.19">bluetooth library called noble and all</span> <span data-start="975.19" data-end="978.13">we need to do is pass the UID of bb-8</span> <span data-start="978.13" data-end="981.399">and we have this bb-8 object that we can</span> <span data-start="981.399" data-end="984.399">use to control the robot I've also</span> <span data-start="984.399" data-end="987.459">created a separate file bb-8 commands</span> <span data-start="987.459" data-end="988.87">that has all the commands that will be</span> <span data-start="988.87" data-end="991.51">using today and now when the app is</span> <span data-start="991.51" data-end="994.26">ready we're going to connect to bb-8 and</span> <span data-start="994.26" data-end="996.88">put something to console and have them</span> <span data-start="996.88" data-end="998.32">change a random color just so that we</span> <span data-start="998.32" data-end="1002.49">know he's awake and now when we get the</span> <span data-start="1002.49" data-end="1004.5">dance message we're going to call our</span> <span data-start="1004.5" data-end="1007.68">dance command and we'll take a look at</span> <span data-start="1007.68" data-end="1012.87">that so it's pretty simple it just sets</span> <span data-start="1012.87" data-end="1015.569">a couple of intervals and has bb-8 role</span> <span data-start="1015.569" data-end="1018.42">in a random for random distance in a</span> <span data-start="1018.42" data-end="1020.97">random direction and change a random</span> <span data-start="1020.97" data-end="1023.88">color and we also want to play some</span> <span data-start="1023.88" data-end="1027.089">music for bb-8 to dance to so we're</span> <span data-start="1027.089" data-end="1034.26">going to use the Audio API and we're</span> <span data-start="1034.26" data-end="1037.169">going to send a sound message to our</span> <span data-start="1037.169" data-end="1039.63">render process and the name of the file</span> <span data-start="1039.63" data-end="1042.9">the sound file that we want to play so</span> <span data-start="1042.9" data-end="1045.66">again we're using IPC sending sound to</span> <span data-start="1045.66" data-end="1047.549">the main process or the renderer process</span> <span data-start="1047.549" data-end="1051.09">and when we receive that message and the</span> <span data-start="1051.09" data-end="1054.83">name of our audio file we're going to</span> <span data-start="1054.83" data-end="1061.35">play the song okay so now comes the</span> <span data-start="1061.35" data-end="1064.44">moment of truth see if we can get bb-8</span> <span data-start="1064.44" data-end="1067.919">to dance for us but first since bb-8 is</span> <span data-start="1067.919" data-end="1071.33">so small I brought a webcam so that</span> <span data-start="1071.33" data-end="1074.13">everyone can get a better</span> <span data-start="1074.13" data-end="1079.65">you of his dance moves and I have</span> <span data-start="1079.65" data-end="1081.75">another menu bar app that was created</span> <span data-start="1081.75" data-end="1084.42">specifically for this presentation it's</span> <span data-start="1084.42" data-end="1088.98">another electron app that uses WebRTC to</span> <span data-start="1088.98" data-end="1093.54">display the feed from a given webcam so</span> <span data-start="1093.54" data-end="1095.94">hopefully y'all can see you bb-8 better</span> <span data-start="1095.94" data-end="1104.01">now and I'll stick this down here okay</span> <span data-start="1104.01" data-end="1107.43">now for the moment of truth pray to the</span> <span data-start="1107.43" data-end="1112.53">demo gods but this works wait for bb-8</span> <span data-start="1112.53" data-end="1116.25">to connect and there we go and we see</span> <span data-start="1116.25" data-end="1119.37">he's turned a pretty blue and he's ready</span> <span data-start="1119.37" data-end="1125.12">for some dance moves okay so now let's</span> <span data-start="1125.12" data-end="1129.23">we see that we have our dance button and</span> <span data-start="1129.23" data-end="1143.06">when we click it</span> <span data-start="1143.07" data-end="1148.39">thank you haha all right so you can see</span> <span data-start="1148.39" data-end="1151.53">that pretty quickly we were able to</span> <span data-start="1151.53" data-end="1154.45">throw some code together and control</span> <span data-start="1154.45" data-end="1157.809">bb-8 here and we can have them do more</span> <span data-start="1157.809" data-end="1162.61">than just dance so check out another</span> <span data-start="1162.61" data-end="1171">commits and start the app so we can also</span> <span data-start="1171" data-end="1175.03">turn bb-8 into a disco bb-8 ball have</span> <span data-start="1175.03" data-end="1178.299">them change some pretty colors and spin</span> <span data-start="1178.299" data-end="1186.89">around for us</span> <span data-start="1186.9" data-end="1192.58">and we can also use bb-8 as a magic bb-8</span> <span data-start="1192.58" data-end="1194.77">ball and for those of you who aren't</span> <span data-start="1194.77" data-end="1196.9">familiar with magic eight balls they're</span> <span data-start="1196.9" data-end="1199">basically these toys they're kind of for</span> <span data-start="1199" data-end="1202.84">fortune-telling and you can ask them</span> <span data-start="1202.84" data-end="1204.49">simple yes or no questions and shake</span> <span data-start="1204.49" data-end="1207.12">them and they'll give you a response so</span> <span data-start="1207.12" data-end="1211.69">we can ask bb-8 questions like BBA do</span> <span data-start="1211.69" data-end="1214.57">you think that will have any luck seeing</span> <span data-start="1214.57" data-end="1217.72">the northern lights tonight and see if</span> <span data-start="1217.72" data-end="1222.22">he says yes or no oh hello okay he's not</span> <span data-start="1222.22" data-end="1226.35">very optimistic um but we can be helpful</span> <span data-start="1226.35" data-end="1230.29">let's see a let's ask him bb-8 are you</span> <span data-start="1230.29" data-end="1236.86">having fun today oh hello huh um okay</span> <span data-start="1236.86" data-end="1238.45">maybe after this next portion you'll be</span> <span

data-start="1241.6" data-end="1248.37">that yeah okay um so magic bb-8 ball and</span> <span data-start="1248.37" data-end="1250.9">lastly there's a way for you all to</span> <span data-start="1250.9" data-end="1252.85">interact with bb-8 by tweeting at him</span> <span data-start="1252.85" data-end="1256.33">and I'll let you I'll tell you exactly</span> <span data-start="1256.33" data-end="1257.89">how if you want to take out your phones</span> <span data-start="1257.89" data-end="1260.5">tweet out of him one lucky tweeter is</span> <span data-start="1260.5" data-end="1262.15">going to get a free github shirt so a</span> <span data-start="1262.15" data-end="1265.03">little extra incentive there and we're</span> <span data-start="1265.03" data-end="1267.52">going to take a look at this code before</span> <span data-start="1267.52" data-end="1273.22">we do this so we're going to be using</span> <span data-start="1273.22" data-end="1276.42">the twitter api we have it's a twitter</span> <span data-start="1276.42" data-end="1281.02">npm module and i have code that will get</span> <span data-start="1281.02" data-end="1286.24">me a random tweet and if you tweet at</span> <span data-start="1286.24" data-end="1290.62">bb-8 will be looking for tweets with a</span> <span data-start="1290.62"
