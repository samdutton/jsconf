<p><span data-start="54.44" data-end="59.629">I am Panos Astithas and the title of my talk this morning is write</span> <span data-start="59.629" data-end="65.369">once, debug everywhere, from Firefox, and the title came</span> <span data-start="65.369" data-end="68.6">from my previous experiences as a Java developer back</span> <span data-start="68.6" data-end="73.18">in the day when the motto used to be write once, write</span> <span data-start="73.18" data-end="76.12">everywhere, and we used to be so excited about it and</span> <span data-start="76.12" data-end="81.95">jump around, and later we discovered that the actual state</span> <span data-start="81.95" data-end="85.09">of things was write once, debug everywhere.</span> <span data-start="85.09" data-end="87.75">Which wasn't so good.</span> <span data-start="87.75" data-end="92.179">Then as we grew up and moved on to web development, what</span> <span data-start="92.179" data-end="95.2">I discovered was that the reality here is more like</span> <span data-start="95.2" data-end="98.859">write once, debug everywhere, each time with different</span> <span data-start="98.859" data-end="101.439">tools, which is even worse.</span> <span data-start="101.439" data-end="109.429">So in a way my talk today is about how we could make the tools we use</span> <span data-start="109.429" data-end="114.11">talk each other, because tools, as well as people, get</span> <span data-start="114.11" data-end="116.979">better when they communicate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="116.979" data-end="119.719">So just a few words about me.</span> <span data-start="119.719" data-end="123.7">I work on Firefox for the past 4 years, recently as a tech lead</span> <span data-start="123.7" data-end="126.74">for Valence, the project I'm going to be talking about</span> <span data-start="126.74" data-end="127.74">today.</span> <span data-start="127.74" data-end="131.23">Previously, I worked on the network panel, lots of</span> <span data-start="131.23" data-end="134.74">stuff, and even before that, I did things like service</span> <span data-start="134.74" data-end="138.08">site development, mobile development, and I really felt</span> <span data-start="138.08" data-end="143.68">the pain of having to use different development environments for a single project.</span> <span data-start="143.68" data-end="149.94">So this is something that I would like to see fixed.</span> <span data-start="149.94" data-end="155.519">Today we'll talk about the problem, and I'll speak about Valence,</span> <span data-start="155.519" data-end="159.5">the solution we think fits the domain.</span> <span data-start="159.5" data-end="163.48">I'll talk more about how it works, what you can do with it, what kind</span> <span data-start="163.48" data-end="169.9">of debug targets you can use it towards, why we chose</span> <span data-start="169.9" data-end="173.14">to ship it as an add-on instead of bundling it inside</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="173.14" data-end="179.18">Firefox, how do you install it, and as an engineer, I consider</span> <span data-start="179.18" data-end="182.04">it my moral obligation to have at least one slide</span> <span data-start="182.04" data-end="185.099">in my talks with actual code, so we'll get to do that</span> <span data-start="185.099" data-end="187.76">near the end.</span> <span data-start="187.76" data-end="189.53">So the problem.</span> <span data-start="189.53" data-end="197.5">I'm not sure if you have recently seen the desks of web developers who are really</span> <span data-start="197.5" data-end="202.03">passionate about their work, and have to test their code</span> <span data-start="202.03" data-end="206.01">in many different environments from other browsers, from</span> <span data-start="206.01" data-end="212.019">other device form factors, but the ones that I've seen</span> <span data-start="212.019" data-end="215.129">usually look a little bit like this.</span> <span data-start="215.129" data-end="218.049">Which is kind of insane.</span> <span data-start="218.049" data-end="222.36">You know the left one tests Firefox and the other one tests Chrome, and in the middle</span> <span data-start="222.36" data-end="224.81">it is IE, or iPad simulator, or whatever.</span> <span data-start="224.81" data-end="230.17">But what I really want to do and really want to work with is something</span> <span data-start="230.17" data-end="232.38">more like that.</span> <span data-start="232.38" data-end="237.769">Like the serenity of a single laptop, empty desk</span> <span data-start="237.769" data-end="241.81">that has space for notebook, even with espresso on the</span> <span data-start="241.81" data-end="242.81">side.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="242.81" data-end="245.4">This is the dream, right?</span> <span data-start="245.4" data-end="249.14">So let's break the test down.</span> <span data-start="249.14" data-end="255.891">I am your average developer, I have this web app, this excuse of a web app, which is my</span> <span data-start="255.891" data-end="259.829">website, but bear with me, and I want to make sure it works</span> <span data-start="259.829" data-end="265">correctly across all browsers, all form factors.</span> <span data-start="265" data-end="266.05">How do I start?</span> <span data-start="266.05" data-end="269.36">I'm a Firefox fan, I'm most comfortable with the Firefox</span> <span data-start="269.36" data-end="272.1">tools, so I make sure it works on Firefox first.</span> <span data-start="272.1" data-end="278.03">You have to start somewhere, so I use the tools,</span> <span data-start="278.03" data-end="283.69">and I inspect my code, I debug it, I test the</span> <span data-start="283.69" data-end="288.19">performance, I fine tune it around here, so in the end, it's</span> <span data-start="288.19" data-end="289.2">okay, I'm happy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.2" data-end="291.61">I'm done.</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="294.28">And I want to make sure that it works in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="294.28" data-end="300.27">So what I do, I fire up Chrome, I fire up Chrome developer tools, and I'm presented</span> <span data-start="300.27" data-end="303.139">with a slightly different environment.</span> <span data-start="303.139" data-end="306.77">It is not that this is completely different, like an entirely</span> <span data-start="306.77" data-end="311.699">outlandish piece, but more like the layout is slightly</span> <span data-start="311.699" data-end="314.74">weird to what I'm expecting, and maybe the labels are</span> <span data-start="314.74" data-end="320.86">different or are the same, but do something different.</span> <span data-start="320.86" data-end="323.669">I'm an experienced developer, I can manage, put some</span> <span data-start="323.669" data-end="327.75">effort into it, fix the quirks that manifest only</span> <span data-start="327.75" data-end="331.74">in this particular browser, and when I'm done in move</span> <span data-start="331.74" data-end="333.789">on to the next thing, Safari.</span> <span data-start="333.789" data-end="341.55">I start Safari, open the web tools which are again different, and I don't see</span> <span data-start="341.55" data-end="347.61">many labels here, I see more icons, lot of purple, maybe,</span> <span data-start="347.61" data-end="351.639">and perhaps the motivation I have for doing this</span> <span data-start="351.639" data-end="356.91">kind of work starts to diminish, because I get less</span> <span data-start="356.91" data-end="360.89">productive because the tools are not working as I expected</span> <span data-start="360.89" data-end="362.63">them to be.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.63" data-end="364.979">And I'm not even done yet, because next I have to</span> <span data-start="364.979" data-end="368.22">move to IE and use another set of tools which looks</span> <span data-start="368.22" data-end="372.569">entirely different, and to be fair this is not a failure</span> <span data-start="372.569" data-end="373.88">of the tools themselves.</span> <span data-start="373.88" data-end="378.84">They are finely crafted for their particular audiences and do their job</span> <span data-start="378.84" data-end="379.84">well.</span> <span data-start="379.84" data-end="383.129">The problem is that each developer has their own</span> <span data-start="383.129" data-end="386.41">preference, and what they would like to do is use the</span> <span data-start="386.41" data-end="390.379">tool they're most familiar with to debug a web application,</span> <span data-start="390.379" data-end="395.17">a standard web application running on all platforms, all</span> <span data-start="395.17" data-end="396.17">browsers.</span> <span data-start="396.17" data-end="398.91">So let me remind you that we haven't even talked</span> <span data-start="398.91" data-end="400.599">about mobile yet.</span> <span data-start="400.599" data-end="404.55">So things should probably get better.</span> <span data-start="404.55" data-end="407.41">The question I want to pose to you today is: is this as</span> <span data-start="407.41" data-end="412.4">good as it gets, or can we do any better than that?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="412.4" data-end="415.669">And by better, I mean something like this.</span> <span data-start="415.669" data-end="418.62">The tools that I'm comfortable with, at the Firefox developer</span> <span data-start="418.62" data-end="423.86">tools, being able to debug a web app running in Chrome</span> <span data-start="423.86" data-end="426.669">without me having to switch to a different tool set</span> <span data-start="426.669" data-end="429.14">and learn a different paradigm.</span> <span data-start="429.14" data-end="432.48">And I'm sure you won't be surprised to know that Valence provides exactly</span> <span data-start="432.48" data-end="438.15">that, and we'll get to how this works in a minute.</span> <span data-start="438.15" data-end="442.06">So Valence is an add-on that we developed that let's</span> <span data-start="442.06" data-end="446.24">you debug web apps running in other browsers, but before</span> <span data-start="446.24" data-end="450.449">I get to the details of how it works, it will be useful,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="450.449" data-end="454.379">I think, to give you a quick idea of how the developer</span> <span data-start="454.379" data-end="460.07">tools in Firefox are architected, the main one is a</span> <span data-start="460.07" data-end="464.05">tool piece that has the tool user interface, the thing</span> <span data-start="464.05" data-end="470.86">you interact with by pressing buttons, typing in ink forms</span> <span data-start="470.86" data-end="474.61">as the client for it, and that line communicates</span> <span data-start="474.61" data-end="477.84">with the server through the Firefox debugging protocol,</span> <span data-start="477.84" data-end="481.99">which has its own specification which is open, and everything</span> <span data-start="481.99" data-end="483.789">of course is open source, but even the spec is</span> <span data-start="483.789" data-end="485.31">documented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="485.31" data-end="490.139">And the debug server is mostly a container for various</span> <span data-start="490.139" data-end="493.699">actors which are entities that control the individual</span> <span data-start="493.699" data-end="497.34">features of a low-level platform.</span> <span data-start="497.34" data-end="503.31">Things like objects in the JavaScript virtual machine, stylesheets,</span> <span data-start="503.31" data-end="508.24">individual styles, nodes in the mark-up, et cetera.</span> <span data-start="508.24" data-end="513.36">Of course, in the bottom you'll have the browser range in which contains the virtual machine,</span> <span data-start="513.36" data-end="516.25">the rendering edging and stuff like that.</span> <span data-start="516.25" data-end="521.99">So in this architecture, when you introduce Valence,</span> <span data-start="521.99" data-end="526.22">what it does is extends the debugger server with an adaptor</span> <span data-start="526.22" data-end="530.11">that contains new actors that know how to speak</span> <span data-start="530.11" data-end="535.91">to protocols to communicate with external browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="535.91" data-end="538.75">So Valence provides you with the ability to target a</span> <span data-start="538.75" data-end="544.76">remote browser and handle those individual platform features</span> <span data-start="544.76" data-end="551.25">over the protocol.</span> <span data-start="551.25" data-end="554.25">So Valence, what it does is it extends the debugger</span> <span data-start="554.25" data-end="558.22">server, provides an adaptor for external browser back</span> <span data-start="558.22" data-end="562.38">ends, it knows how to speak the WebKit and blink</span> <span data-start="562.38" data-end="567.04">protocols, and in the future we hope even more.</span> <span data-start="567.04" data-end="570.56">And it does that by being asynchronous to a whole</span> <span data-start="570.56" data-end="574.3">new level, and I'll show you a little bit about that,</span> <span data-start="574.3" data-end="576.41">and the way we manage to accomplish that is by making</span> <span data-start="576.41" data-end="581.94">heavy use of ES6 or ES2015, as we heard before, promises</span> <span data-start="581.94" data-end="583.7">and generator functions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="583.7" data-end="590.73">It also includes a third-party open source library called IOS WebKit debug</span> <span data-start="590.73" data-end="594.43">proxy, Google sponsored the Openkit project that</span> <span data-start="594.43" data-end="600.22">provides a thin layer of transport to IOS devices like</span> <span data-start="600.22" data-end="604.31">iPhones, iPads, even the IOS simulator, and we also</span> <span data-start="604.31" data-end="608.61">bundle a windows clone of that project in our windows</span> <span data-start="608.61" data-end="610.29">platform.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="610.29" data-end="615.8">With Firefox, what you can do is debug your web app in</span> <span data-start="615.8" data-end="619.41">any Firefox project like desktop, Firefox on android,</span> <span data-start="619.41" data-end="623.55">and IOS devices, phones, DVDs, etc, and with the</span> <span data-start="623.55" data-end="627.779">addition of Valence you can now communicate running on</span> <span data-start="627.779" data-end="633.89">debug on android and Safari, and IOS and I hope in the</span> <span data-start="633.89" data-end="636.06">future will provide the ability to debug web apps</span> <span data-start="636.06" data-end="638.44">running in Explorer and node.</span> <span data-start="638.44" data-end="643.19">One of the questions I get a lot is: why ship it as</span> <span data-start="643.19" data-end="644.19">an add-on?</span> <span data-start="644.19" data-end="646.8">Why not bundle it inside Firefox?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="646.8" data-end="649.31">And there are a number of reasons for that.</span> <span data-start="649.31" data-end="654.6">One is that Valence, as a project, has some external dependencies</span> <span data-start="654.6" data-end="656.459">that Firefox doesn't have.</span> <span data-start="656.459" data-end="663.15">It depends on the release cadence of other browsers like Chrome or Safari, it</span> <span data-start="663.15" data-end="666.99">depends on changes to the published mode debug protocol</span> <span data-start="666.99" data-end="670.06">of those browsers, and things they might become obsolete</span> <span data-start="670.06" data-end="673.73">or modified or broken, and what we really need</span> <span data-start="673.73" data-end="677.45">to do is be able to iterate rapidly once these things</span> <span data-start="677.45" data-end="681.32">happen, and the release cadence over the Firefox browser,</span> <span data-start="681.32" data-end="684.04">even with the rapid release schedule is not suitable</span> <span data-start="684.04" data-end="687.201">for that purpose.</span> <span data-start="687.201" data-end="690.99">In addition, we found that moving in the code to an</span> <span data-start="690.99" data-end="693.97">add-on makes it easy to host it in a separate github</span> <span data-start="693.97" data-end="697.779">project, so external contributors can find it easier to</span> <span data-start="697.779" data-end="702.61">contribute, fix bugs, provide new features.</span> <span data-start="702.61" data-end="706.37">And it also helps us minimise the development tools footprint</span> <span data-start="706.37" data-end="710.43">inside Firefox for the users who are not interested</span> <span data-start="710.43" data-end="713.31">in developing in debugging their web apps in</span> <span data-start="713.31" data-end="714.68">other browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="714.68" data-end="718.029">So be mindful of that as well.</span> <span data-start="718.029" data-end="721.29">How do we solve this thing?</span> <span data-start="721.29" data-end="723.49">Well, we're all engineers, right?</span> <span data-start="723.49" data-end="725.69">We know how it goes.</span> <span data-start="725.69" data-end="728.82">You go to your terminal, you clone your stuff, you compile,</span> <span data-start="728.82" data-end="729.82">you make, install, you run.</span> <span data-start="729.82" data-end="734.57">That's usually how it happens, but not in Firefox, because because Firefox is</span> <span data-start="734.57" data-end="740.72">about automating the nitty-gritty details for you.</span> <span data-start="740.72" data-end="746.56">So you go to the hamburger menu, click on the developer</span> <span data-start="746.56" data-end="751.17">button and then select web ID. Web ID is our entrance</span> <span data-start="751.17" data-end="754.29">to remote debugging Firefox.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="754.29" data-end="760.49">And in the runtime list, which you'll see then is the Chrome in Safari runtimes,</span> <span data-start="760.49" data-end="763.42">because what has happened is that the first time you try</span> <span data-start="763.42" data-end="767.76">to launch web ID it will go behind the scenes, reach the</span> <span data-start="767.76" data-end="772.93">Mozilla servers, download the add-on, install it,</span> <span data-start="772.93" data-end="777.029">initialise it, so you get your extra runtimes there and</span> <span data-start="777.029" data-end="780.99">if you have an android device connected to the computer</span> <span data-start="780.99" data-end="784.29">via USB, you will even see that in the list of USB</span> <span data-start="784.29" data-end="789.17">devices or the Firefox USB devices or what have you.</span> <span data-start="789.17" data-end="792.05">So pretty simple: you don't have to do anything.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="792.05" data-end="794.88">You already have it, essentially, when you need it.</span> <span data-start="794.88" data-end="798.88">Now, let's get a little bit more technical.</span> <span data-start="798.88" data-end="803.02">Let's talk about how actors are implemented.</span> <span data-start="803.02" data-end="807.87">Firefox actors are pretty standard JavaScript objects, and they</span> <span data-start="807.87" data-end="811.93">contain methods that receive requests from the client</span> <span data-start="811.93" data-end="816.26">side to perform various operations, and these requests</span> <span data-start="816.26" data-end="819.43">are formatted in the standard way that the remote</span> <span data-start="819.43" data-end="821.98">debugging protocol specifies.</span> <span data-start="821.98" data-end="825.56">And a simple one looks like this.</span> <span data-start="825.56" data-end="829.279">This is the function that gets called once you type</span> <span data-start="829.279" data-end="831.769">something in the web console and hit "enter".</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="831.769" data-end="836.38">It is on the evaluate JavaScript function, which is</span> <span data-start="836.38" data-end="841.11"> —  you can see here it is not just entirely removed the</span> <span data-start="841.11" data-end="843.88">error handling and some initialisation stuff, but</span> <span data-start="843.88" data-end="847.73">it is pretty much the code that runs in your Firefox today.</span> <span data-start="847.73" data-end="851.63">So what it does is it takes the request, it extracts</span> <span data-start="851.63" data-end="854.38">the text property that contains the string you tie</span> <span data-start="854.38" data-end="858.86">in the console, it uses a low level debugging PI</span> <span data-start="858.86" data-end="862.43">in SpiderMonkey to make the evaluation of that</span> <span data-start="862.43" data-end="866.54">expression, grabs the return value, makes a few checks</span> <span data-start="866.54" data-end="870.5">about error conditions, et cetera, and extracts the return</span> <span data-start="870.5" data-end="872.95">value and sends it back to the client.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="872.95" data-end="875.36">It is pretty straightforward.</span> <span data-start="875.36" data-end="880.209">Your standard JavaScript method, I suppose.</span> <span data-start="880.209" data-end="883.029">So the difference in the implementation of the</span> <span data-start="883.029" data-end="886.6">Valence actor, he has to do mostly with asynchronicity.</span> <span data-start="886.6" data-end="892.42">So this is the same function that is executed every time</span> <span data-start="892.42" data-end="895.41">you type something in the Firefox web console, hit</span> <span data-start="895.41" data-end="899.17">enter, and that expression gets evaluated in Chrome.</span> <span data-start="899.17" data-end="907.24">If you ignore the async method helper to reduce some</span> <span data-start="907.24" data-end="910.12">of the bugger in our product handling, is that you see</span> <span data-start="910.12" data-end="916.75">that we generator function, star function that receives</span> <span data-start="916.75" data-end="921.62">the expression the user sent, and then the first thing</span> <span data-start="921.62" data-end="925.93">it has to do is go across the Chrome debugging protocol,</span> <span data-start="925.93" data-end="931.81">make request for the evaluation, and yield the execution</span> <span data-start="931.81" data-end="934.69">back to the main thread.</span> <span data-start="934.69" data-end="941.55">Once the result is back, it needs to take the response and make that previewable</span> <span data-start="941.55" data-end="945.36">and it does that by making a new request to load</span> <span data-start="945.36" data-end="950.63">preview, and the reason is to get a more useful representation</span> <span data-start="950.63" data-end="952.36">of the result, so that we can display it in the</span> <span data-start="952.36" data-end="957.75">web console in a colourful, easy to expand way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="957.75" data-end="965.08">This one, another pause until the protocol request returns,</span> <span data-start="965.08" data-end="968.839">and after that, we will then ready to check for errors,</span> <span data-start="968.839" data-end="973.17">we have the result, and return.</span> <span data-start="973.17" data-end="979.029">I would say that the second method is not more verbose than the first</span> <span data-start="979.029" data-end="981.36">one, I would say they're equally concise.</span> <span data-start="981.36" data-end="985.6">I've removed around ten or 20 lines from each that had to do with error</span> <span data-start="985.6" data-end="989.589">handling and details like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="989.589" data-end="994.45">But it is just that the nature of the programming is slightly different,</span> <span data-start="994.45" data-end="998.14">and I think for people who are not used to program with</span> <span data-start="998.14" data-end="1001.819">generator functions and promises, this will look a whole</span> <span data-start="1001.819" data-end="1005.72">lot better.</span> <span data-start="1005.72" data-end="1008.089">How does it feel to work with Valence compared to</span> <span data-start="1008.089" data-end="1009.529">what we have today?</span> <span data-start="1009.529" data-end="1012.17">Let's take a look.</span> <span data-start="1012.17" data-end="1016.279">This is me debugging my web application on Firefox desktop,</span> <span data-start="1016.279" data-end="1017.66">as before.</span> <span data-start="1017.66" data-end="1024.28">But the same tools I used here I can use to debug my web application running on Chrome</span> <span data-start="1024.28" data-end="1029.14">without switching tools or browsers or anything.</span> <span data-start="1029.14" data-end="1031.699">I can make sure, as you can see here, I have highlighted</span> <span data-start="1031.699" data-end="1036.24">the image and that's the margins and paddings were highlighted</span> <span data-start="1036.24" data-end="1040.76">by Chrome's inspector underneath, but what controls</span> <span data-start="1040.76" data-end="1044.1">the Chrome inspector is Firefox through Valence.</span> </p>
