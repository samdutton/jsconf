very fancy so this is an</span> <span data-start="845.35" data-end="846.82">application that we call social traffic</span> <span data-start="846.82" data-end="849.22">occasionally see it now at social

<span data-start="875.98" data-end="880.66">down we see actual twitter names</span> <span data-start="880.66" data-end="883.9">associated with the traffic that they</span> <span data-start="883.9"
