like</span> <span data-start="374.08" data-end="376.33">firing off a whole bunch of times over</span> <span data-start="376.33" data-end="378.4">there so we're we're no longer blocked</span> <span

<p><span data-start="463.77" data-end="467.19">I thought that would be a good play on</span> <span data-start="467.19" data-end="469.65">the hold ojs thing and then look the</span> <span

data-end="594.209">at some point in the future then you</span> <span data-start="594.209" data-end="596.25">render any code that's using this API</span> <span data-start="596.25" data-end="597.07">and

started</span> <span data-start="621.19" data-end="622.87">to think like well this is like really</span> <span data-start="622.87" data-end="625.42">you know loads and D loads yeah perfect</span> <span data-start="625.42" data-end="626.62">it makes sense it's a real world</span> <span data-start="626.62" data-end="628.45">application right you guys do that all</span> <span data-start="628.45" data-end="630.37">the time that's like wait nobody does</span> <span data-start="630.37" data-end="633.43">that like what's a an actual example of</span> <span data-start="633.43" data-end="636.7">what we can do you know to to take</span> <span data-start="636.7" data-end="637.69">advantage of these when we're</span> <span data-start="637.69" data-end="640.42">constructing our

perform</span> <span data-start="643.45" data-end="645.97">later just based on on the logic</span> <span data-start="645.97" data-end="647.35">conditions but they just know it's going</span> <span data-start="647.35" data-end="648.79">to perform the same way every time and</span> <span data-start="648.79" data-end="651.51">this example is the one that I landed on</span> <span data-start="651.51" data-end="655.68">so we have two constructor classes here</span> <span data-start="655.68" data-end="658.66">and they perform entirely different and</span> <span data-start="658.66" data-end="660.46">you probably run into this I would think</span> <span data-start="660.46" data-end="663.91">at some point but the the cigarettes one</span> <span data-start="663.91" data-end="665.95">is really just a constructor and we call</span> <span data-start="665.95" data-end="667.63">that we say hey we want a new sink and</span> <span data-start="667.63" data-end="668.83">it's going to say hey I'm gonna park</span> <span data-start="668.83" data-end="670">some options for that and then I'm going</span> <span data-start="670" data-end="672.34">to initialize and immediately after that</span> <span data-start="672.34" data-end="673.9">it does its initialize things and it</span> <span data-start="673.9" data-end="675.88">says hey I'm going to omit some events</span> <span data-start="675.88" data-end="678.25">and and then I'm going to be done in</span> <span data-start="678.25" data-end="683.71">this example so if we run this block of</span> <span data-start="683.71" data-end="686.14">code here that says hey you know I want</span> <span data-start="686.14" data-end="687.82">a new sink and then I want to listen
