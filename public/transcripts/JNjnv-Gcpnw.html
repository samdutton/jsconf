<p><span data-start="353.32" data-end="356.65">Dom is basically a tiny document that</span> <span data-start="356.65" data-end="359.44">lives inside of a host element and when</span> <span

so yeah browsers already used them</span> <span data-start="374.71" data-end="380.17">and now developers can too so let's</span> <span data-start="380.17" data-end="383.2">create minimal shadow I have this div</span> <span data-start="383.2" data-end="385.27">here I've just put a border on it so you</span> <span data-start="385.27" data-end="387.13">guys can see it but if we go into my</span> <span

data-start="400.169" data-end="414.04">console and let's select spooky</span> <span data-start="414.05" data-end="417.63">okay so we've got spooky and then let's</span> <span data-start="417.63" data-end="419.43">do some voodoo with spooky let's give it</span> <span data-start="419.43" data-end="429.03">a its own shadow root and we passed the</span> <span data-start="429.03" data-end="430.199">argument of spooky because that's the</span> <span data-start="430.199" data-end="431.1">element that we're giving the shadow</span> <span data-start="431.1" data-end="435.78">root 2 and then we insert a shadow root</span> <span data-start="435.78" data-end="438.36">into spooky but that's not very exciting</span> <span data-start="438.36" data-end="439.949">because we don't have anything inside</span> <span data-start="439.949" data-end="443.419">that shadow Dom yet so let's give that</span> <span data-start="443.419" data-end="447.24">some innerhtml let's say we do the</span> <span data-start="447.24" data-end="453.11">classic hello world well let's say hello</span> <span data-start="453.11" data-end="457.84">yes come for you</span> <span data-start="457.85" data-end="460.41">huzzah it appears ok that's not for</span> <span data-start="460.41" data-end="461.85">exciting right great that's just it</span> <span data-start="461.85" data-end="463.289">seems really similar to how we're</span> <span data-start="463.289" data-end="465.12">already doing things just injecting code</span> <span data-start="465.12" data-end="467.28">into the Dom but what's really cool</span> <span data-start="467.28" data-end="469.38">about this is you guys can see that it</span> <span data-start="469.38" data-end="471.45">says hello Jay has come for you if we go</span> <span data-start="471.45" data-end="474.03">into the source and we look for our dev</span> <span data-start="474.03" data-end="478.71">spooky and let me zoom this in here you</span> <span data-start="478.71" data-end="482.03">can see that spooky is still empty and</span> <span data-start="482.03" data-end="484.44">but that's really strange right because</span> <span data-start="484.44" data-end="485.94">we're seeing this text there and I you</span> <span data-start="485.94" data-end="487.65">just saw me insert this shadow Dom so</span> <span data-start="487.65" data-end="491.55">why doesn't it exist in spooky and I'm</span> <span data-start="491.55" data-end="497.3">going to tell you so how this works oh</span> <span data-start="497.3" data-end="499.71">that's kind of cut off don't know what</span> <span data-start="499.71" data-end="507.57">happened there nope okay well let's just</span> <span data-start="507.57" data-end="510.72">keep going so how this works is the</span> <span data-start="510.72" data-end="512.789">shadow root is inserted into the host</span> <span data-start="512.789" data-end="515.039">node and when that happens the rendering</span> <span data-start="515.039" data-end="517.289">of the shadow Dom replaces the rendering</span> <span data-start="517.289" data-end="521.64">of the children of the host nodes so the</span> <span data-start="521.64" data-end="523.529">original nodes in the source aren't</span> <span data-start="523.529" data-end="525.18">altered at all you just replace the</span> <span data-start="525.18" data-end="529.02">rendering of them and so I mean that's</span> <span data-start="529.02" data-end="530.279">all well and good I mean the example we</span> <span data-start="530.279" data-end="533.76">used here is that you know I just</span> <span data-start="533.76" data-end="536.4">inserted some some h1 tag into an empty</span> <span data-start="536.4" data-end="538.02">element but what happens if these</span> <span data-start="538.02" data-end="538.899">elements already</span> <span data-start="538.899" data-end="540.249">have children right I mean we may not</span> <span data-start="540.249" data-end="541.99">necessarily want to totally wipe out the</span> <span data-start="541.99" data-end="548.48">content that's there and so we have a</span> <span data-start="548.49" data-end="552.97">zoom oh hey did I zoom out on that's</span> <span data-start="552.97" data-end="555.339">what happened excellent excellent thank</span> <span data-start="555.339" data-end="555.699">you</span> <span data-start="555.699" data-end="558.399">all right so we have a special tag</span> <span data-start="558.399" data-end="560.05">called the Content tag that will specify</span> <span data-start="560.05" data-end="562.3">the insertion point for the child</span> <span data-start="562.3" data-end="564.069">elements of the host element into our</span> <span

data-start="569.019" data-end="570.819">to mention that there is a shadow tag</span> <span data-start="570.819" data-end="572.679">that will allow you to nest other shadow</span> <span data-start="572.679" data-end="580.549">roots so let's try it</span> <span data-start="580.559" data-end="582.97">okay so I've got an unordered list here</span> <span data-start="582.97" data-end="587.379">and the ID is you with children because</span> <span data-start="587.379" data-end="589.809">we have this some div with the unordered</span> <span data-start="589.809"
