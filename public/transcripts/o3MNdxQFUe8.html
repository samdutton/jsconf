<p><span data-start="9.4" data-end="16.93">Wow. What an amazing couple of days. I've learned a whole ton of stuff, and what an</span> <span data-start="16.93" data-end="23.31">amazing time to live, working on the internet. There is so much cool technology — progressive</span> <span data-start="23.31" data-end="33.73">web apps, WASMs, machine-learnings, information on how to make our sites fast, great things</span> <span data-start="33.73" data-end="44.7">about user experience, we have service workers, the official logo, Google IO last month said</span> <span data-start="44.7" data-end="49.739">that service workers is like the biggest step forward in a decade, and it's given us off</span> <span data-start="49.739" data-end="57.42">line, and push notifications, and our websites could be even more performant, and there are</span> <span data-start="57.42" data-end="62.989">articles, and Twitter, and social media is going on about how fast our websites have</span> <span data-start="62.989" data-end="71.49">to be, and I feel really tired, and it's draining. I want to go back to a better time where things</span> <span data-start="71.49" data-end="81.22">were more old school, a bit more slower, and louder, and uglier. So I'm going to throw</span> <span data-start="81.22" data-end="86.42">all of the cool stuff that you've learned over the last year and try and go back to</span> <span data-start="86.42" data-end="94.24">that awful experience. I have a couple of content warnings. I do have some flashing</span> <span data-start="94.24" data-end="99.62">imagery in my talk. It's not a huge amount on the screen, but you will see the icon up</span> <span data-start="99.62" data-end="106.27">in the corner. There are disorientating sounds. You will see the icon up in the corner before</span> <span data-start="106.27" data-end="112.22">it starts playing. There is some questionable JavaScript, so, judge me all you want, but</span> <span data-start="112.22" data-end="121.56">it won't make it any better! My name is Remy Sharp. Maybe you've seen my work, JS By. I</span> <span data-start="121.56" data-end="134.81">run FFConf in the UK. I've got a couple of projects, NoDemon. And I was a child of the</span> <span data-start="134.81" data-end="142.84">1980s as I'm stressed with Mr T with the beard and the earrings. I grew up in the UK during</span> <span data-start="142.84" data-end="149.549">the 1980s, and there was an explosion of technology happening at that time. I was privileged enough</span> <span data-start="149.549" data-end="155.68">to be in a household where my father was into computers as well, and — like it was a thing</span> <span data-start="155.68" data-end="162.299">that was happening — and we had this machine. This was my childhood machine that I remember</span> <span data-start="162.299" data-end="170.799">using. This is a ZX Spectrum 48k from Sinclair. It is like the kind of Apple or Microsoft</span> <span data-start="170.799" data-end="179.269">of the time. In Europe, I think it was Time X. This came out in 1982. Now, there are couple</span> <span data-start="179.269" data-end="188.68">of machines prior to that. In 1980, the Sinclair released the ZX80 for £50. For a home computer</span> <span data-start="188.68" data-end="196.849">in 1980 was staggeringly cheap compared to the fact that, in the 1970s, there were machines</span> <span data-start="196.849" data-end="204.719">the size of rooms for thousands of pounds. So, all of a sudden, for £50, about EUR200,</span> <span data-start="204.719" data-end="213.699">you could only a computer in your household. This is what I had as a kid. Instead of being</span> <span data-start="213.699" data-end="218.959">parented, I played games on this. Mum and dad, don't watch. I loved that one of the</span> <span data-start="218.959" data-end="225.439">features here is the key is autorepeat, key feature is like the keys autorepeat, and,</span> <span data-start="225.439" data-end="233.409">to load the after the wear on to these machines, you would have a thing called a cassette tape,</span> <span data-start="233.409" data-end="240.089">this is like an old shit USB stick, not anywhere near as robust, and all kinds of things would</span> <span data-start="240.089" data-end="245.159">go wrong with the tapes. You would take your tape, load it into the cassette player, and</span> <span data-start="245.159" data-end="253.699">you would press play. That would wire into your Spectrum. You wired the Spectrum into</span> <span data-start="253.699" data-end="261.93">your television, and you would wait. And you would wait. And, sometimes, the games wouldn't</span> <span data-start="261.93" data-end="266.13">load, and sometimes, the tape would unspool, so all the tape would come out. Sometimes,</span> <span data-start="266.13" data-end="273.539">it would look like Jimi Hendrix here. Often, you would have to wind it all back again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="273.539" data-end="279.08">A canvassed Twitter to ask people for those of you who had these things, what would you</span> <span data-start="279.08" data-end="284.83">do to try and encourage the thing to load? Some people would leave the room so the computer,</span> <span data-start="284.83" data-end="288.49">this God-like thing had to be alone. Some people turned the machines upside-down. I</span> <span data-start="288.49" data-end="294.599">would pray to the thing, please load, please load. To be fair, I still use this technique</span> <span data-start="294.599" data-end="302.669">on my phone. So, in truth, most of my childhood was spent listening to these games loading,</span> <span data-start="302.669" data-end="308.469">so what is what I want to recreate for you and bring back the old school. This is using</span> <span data-start="308.469" data-end="315.189">the only technology I know, which is a browser, obviously. Just to give you full context,</span> <span data-start="315.189" data-end="319.9">this is what it sounded like, and looked like. I've forgotten the content warning, so there</span> <span data-start="319.9" data-end="325.31">will be loud noises here, and I will turn it down as we are going, and it's a bit flashy</span> <span data-start="325.31" data-end="346.52">too. So you want it from the beginning. [Electronic screeching sounds]. If you're a kid of six</span> <span data-start="346.52" data-end="353.539">or seven and waiting for this game. That's what you have to listen to. Okay? And this</span> <span data-start="353.539" data-end="356.74">is just the loading screen. This is just the thing to tell you this is what it might look</span> <span data-start="356.74" data-end="367.169">like. [Laughter]. Assuming the tape wouldn't go bad, and the Spectrums were buggy. I'm</span> <span data-start="367.169" data-end="378.21">going to remake that. So, the Spectrum, that loading experience, one of the key parts is</span> <span data-start="378.21" data-end="384.669">the sound. So, the sound is broken up into three parts: you've got the pilot signal which</span> <span data-start="384.669" data-end="388.479">is like the steady tone that happened at the beginning; then there is a sync signal which</span> <span data-start="388.479" data-end="393.169">is a burst of sound; and then I've got data. What we were list he can to just then was</span> <span data-start="393.169" data-end="402.099">data. Like, I can do this. I know there's a web API for sound. I'm going to get a new</span> <span data-start="402.099" data-end="408.3">audio context and create an oscillator and set the frequency of the oscillator to about</span> <span data-start="408.3" data-end="415.05">830 which is the right frequency. I had a friend open me up in Audacity and tell me</span> <span data-start="415.05" data-end="423.889">what the frequency was. I connected to my destination and I start. [Single electronic</span> <span data-start="423.889" data-end="431.18">tone.]. That solid frequency is the pilot signal. Cool. Next bit. Okay. Next bit is</span> <span data-start="431.18" data-end="437.009">making a distinct sound. And I know how to make white noise. I know that I can chuck</span> <span data-start="437.009" data-end="442.05">random data into audio, but this is distinct, and it needs to sound right otherwise it's</span> <span data-start="442.05" data-end="449.46">just all wrong. So, I didn't work on this — worked on this 12 months on and off, but</span> <span data-start="449.46" data-end="459.039">12 months, learning about sound, learning about tones, and frequencies, and processors,</span> <span data-start="459.039" data-end="466.379">and promptly forgot all of that stuff, and you can just fill buffers with samples. So</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="466.379" data-end="470.979">I didn't need to know anything about how sound works to be able to create this. One amazing</span> <span data-start="470.979" data-end="476.469">part of the web that I absolutely love be I was able to go to a website called worldofspectrum.org</span> <span data-start="476.469" data-end="486.79">and filled with game content, old files, specifications. There are people who have reverse engineered</span> <span data-start="486.79" data-end="492.77">the entire hardware and made it work and documented all of that and shared it on the web. I know</span> <span data-start="492.77" data-end="499.47">that the amplitude of the wave form is completely irrelevant. The way the sound works is that</span> <span data-start="499.47" data-end="505.069">it measures this line as a pulse. The point where it crossed the zero mark and goes down</span> <span data-start="505.069" data-end="513.139">below, that is one pulse. This has a length of 855T state. A T state is one operation</span> <span data-start="513.139" data-end="520.329">that the ZX Spectrum can perform, running at 3.5 megahertz, doing 3.5 million operations</span> <span data-start="520.329" data-end="529.56">a second. This is 855T states. That is a quarter of a millisecond. So to get this right, I</span> <span data-start="529.56" data-end="535.73">have to make a quarter of a millisecond sound. A pair of these pulses is a binary zero, and</span> <span data-start="535.73" data-end="543.3">twice the length is a binary one. I have a bunch of numbers now. I can use a bit of maths.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="543.3" data-end="551.041">I take my sample rate of 44 megahertz, which is like the default audio con text sample</span> <span data-start="551.041" data-end="559.24">rate, and I take my 3.5 megahertz — my T-state length. I want to get the number of samples</span> <span data-start="559.24" data-end="565.1">required to match the T state, the T length, and it's basically the length at 855 multiplied</span> <span data-start="565.1" data-end="570.68">by T, multiplied by sample rate plus a little bit more so they get a whole number. I can't</span> <span data-start="570.68" data-end="580.209">have a half sample. For binary, binary one, I get 22 samples. I'm sure no-one will learn</span> <span data-start="580.209" data-end="584.05">anything from this bit of code. Don't worry if you're not following it at this point.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="584.05" data-end="592.37">I will create a buffer that gives me a binary 1 and a binary 0. Here I basically just have</span> <span data-start="592.37" data-end="598.779">the number of samples 11 for zero, a float array that has twice the length, and I populate</span> <span data-start="598.779" data-end="610.26">with a plus one and a negative one which gives me a binary zero. I can now go and get the</span> <span data-start="610.26" data-end="621.509">JSConf home page, I've got the length of bytes by putting an array in an array. I multiple</span> <span data-start="621.509" data-end="628.279">the bytes by eight bits in a bite because there are — multiplied by the length of</span> <span data-start="628.279" data-end="633.889">one, and I get the number of samples required to create the buffer to be the right size</span> <span data-start="633.889" data-end="642.74">to get a play in JSConf EU HTML. I set an audio context, set the buffer. Populate it</span> <span data-start="642.74" data-end="649.42">with this line here — just magic, okay? I'm going to connect that to my destination.</span> <span data-start="649.42" data-end="660.95">Yes. So this is JSConf as audio. I will put my volume back up so you can hear it clearly.</span> <span data-start="660.95" data-end="681.88">[Rapid electronic screeching]. Yes, this is the JSConf music for next year, I'm telling</span> <span data-start="681.88" data-end="688.279">you. [Applause]. Yeah! Basically just hurt a lot of people's ears, and you're clapping</span> <span data-start="688.279" data-end="694.779">me! Sound done. Next off is the loading bars, the super important part of making awful loud</span> <span data-start="694.779" data-end="702.22">ugly images. So, I think a really cool back story to the loading bars? Spectrum. The original</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.22" data-end="707.81">ZX80 had a chip called the ULA which is the main brain of the computer, and they had a</span> <span data-start="707.81" data-end="713.529">restricted number of chips, so they had — sorry, restricted number of pins on the chip, and</span> <span data-start="713.529" data-end="718.99">they had one pin managed all the display. That same pin dealt with reading all of the</span> <span data-start="718.99" data-end="724.37">audio coming in, so when audio came in, it would disrupt the display. Ever the engineer,</span> <span data-start="724.37" data-end="729.639">this is not a bug, this is a feature, because you can see approximately what the baud rate</span> <span data-start="729.639" data-end="736.33">of the data going over the audio, and the engineers why kind of like, "We can see it's</span> <span data-start="736.33" data-end="742.13">loading" so this is basically like a loading bar from the 1980s. In fact, they coded it</span> <span data-start="742.13" data-end="748.24">into the hardware, and the other computer systems went and coded it into their software.</span> <span data-start="748.24" data-end="752.24">The Commodore, for instance, added this as a feature in their software when you loaded</span> <span data-start="752.24" data-end="759.509">games. So I can't just take the bytes from JSConf and dump it into a canvas and say the</span> <span data-start="759.509" data-end="765.769">zeroes are yellow and the ones are blue because it would do it too quickly. I need to take</span> <span data-start="765.769" data-end="772.94">the audio I just generated, run it through a processor, and then emit bits that I will</span> <span data-start="772.94" data-end="781.37">then render on a canvas. I have three choices for this. I can use an analyser node but that</span> <span data-start="781.37" data-end="785.15">didn't really work for me, it was it wasn't giving me enough of the samples that comes</span> <span data-start="785.15" data-end="791.829">off the audio. And then I've got a script processor node, and the audio worklet. Actually,</span> <span data-start="791.829" data-end="801.16">the script processing node has been deprecated as of August 2014 in favour of the audio worklet,</span> <span data-start="801.16" data-end="805.12">and the audio worklet doesn't really have much support in many of the browsers today,</span> <span data-start="805.12" data-end="811.58">so I chose the script processor node. But, it's pretty much the same. The they're cool,</span> <span data-start="811.58" data-end="815.959">but basically, the script processor will block the main thread which is what I want. I want</span> <span data-start="815.959" data-end="823.35">it to be a little bit slower. Okay. So, I've got my loud nasty noise. I connect up a script</span> <span data-start="823.35" data-end="829.24">processor, and the audio event fires, and I get all the samples for that audio event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="829.24" data-end="832.22">I'm going to run through all those samples. I'm going to do the opposite of what I was</span> <span data-start="832.22" data-end="836.819">doing before. I'm going to look for the edges of the sound. The point where the sample rate</span> <span data-start="836.819" data-end="842.3">goes from zero to one and comes back down again, that's the width of my pulse. I'm going</span> <span data-start="842.3" data-end="848.86">to build up pairs of pulses, find the bits, the pairs of pulses which make a bit, and</span> <span data-start="848.86" data-end="856.579">then build up a bit into a byte, and then render it as a bar on the screen. The first</span> <span data-start="856.579" data-end="861.25">time I ran this, I was doing a lot of work with arrays and moving data around in arrays,</span> <span data-start="861.25" data-end="868.89">and I ran a little performance test where I put all the audio through my code. It was</span> <span data-start="868.89" data-end="875.99">like processing 200 or 300 samples through these three or four minutes of noise. It was</span> <span data-start="875.99" data-end="882.771">kind of slow. I could feel this buffer.shift is taking up three seconds. I thought it's</span> <span data-start="882.771" data-end="888.52">the not mutation going on, but when I refactored it a ill will bit and changed it for a splice,</span> <span data-start="888.52" data-end="894.15">it completely changed the performance profile. That was because of the way I was working</span> <span data-start="894.15" data-end="899.769">with arrays. An array contains hundreds of samples, shifting one off at the beginning,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.769" data-end="906.59">JavaScript is not going to do that thousands and thousands and thousands of times. In fact,</span> <span data-start="906.59" data-end="913.51">I changed from regular arrays to typed arrays, and it completely flattened the performance</span> <span data-start="913.51" data-end="917.519">profile. There is ten milliseconds of the most amount of time it spends rather than</span> <span data-start="917.519" data-end="924.1">hundreds of milliseconds. The way that I think about this is a regular array is just a point</span> <span data-start="924.1" data-end="928.62">in memory which the operating systems doesn't really know how much it is going to store</span> <span data-start="928.62" data-end="934.54">in memory, and it's any type can go in there. You can put objects, and strings, and it's</span> <span data-start="934.54" data-end="939.819">not super optimised when it is in memory, but a typed array can only be one length,</span> <span data-start="939.819" data-end="944.54">for starters, so the operating system allocates that amount of memory, and the actual elements</span> <span data-start="944.54" data-end="951.259">inside of the typed array, they can only be either a U in 8, or a floating point, but</span> <span data-start="951.259" data-end="957.41">it has a specific length, so you can specifically jump through that typed array. Typed arrays</span> <span data-start="957.41" data-end="965.769">were superb for this, and it's runtime performance rather than Typescript-like protection of</span> <span data-start="965.769" data-end="974.5">your — I don't use Typescript, not because it is bad. So, my code is able to use a script</span> <span data-start="974.5" data-end="988.88">processor to consume audio that I can then paint blue and red bars for when I get data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="988.88" data-end="1010.259">Heads up audio people. Ready? [Single electronic tone]. Those the bars around the edge. The</span> <span data-start="1010.259" data-end="1030.69">blues are the ones. The yellows are the zeroes. Yeah. Okay. [Applause]. So I have slow, and</span> <span data-start="1030.69" data-end="1039.23">I have loud, but I don't have ugly yet. Now, I don't have any time for Web P, or PNGs,</span> <span data-start="1039.23" data-end="1049.01">gifs, or those fancy image formats, what we need are really old up supported Spectrum</span> <span data-start="1049.01" data-end="1055.02">1980 image formats, so this is the image format I'm going to render — none of this new stuff.</span> <span data-start="1055.02" data-end="1062.19">This is how the image is rendered in a Spectrum. It is a really cute image format — or I</span> <span data-start="1062.19" data-end="1073.28">think it is. It is always exactly 6,912 bytes. It is broken up into these sections. The first</span> <span data-start="1073.28" data-end="1081.45">three-quarters are pixel data. It is literally if the binary is zero. It is white, and, if</span> <span data-start="1081.45" data-end="1092.47">it is black — it is on or off. The first quarter is dedicated to the first third of</span> <span data-start="1092.47" data-end="1096.78">the screen, and then the last section at the end it dedicated to the attribute data which</span> <span data-start="1096.78" data-end="1102.63">makes up the colour that you can see at the bottom, and it is just a byte, a single byte</span> <span data-start="1102.63" data-end="1109.07">gives you see the ink, the paper, the brightness, and that means basically from instead of white</span> <span data-start="1109.07" data-end="1114.98">we can have grey if the brightness is off, and obviously blink, because that's important!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1114.98" data-end="1124.28">Okay? A great part of this code is I think I can — I get to abuse bit-wise operations,</span> <span data-start="1124.28" data-end="1133.66">and I can say for any point in my 6,912 bytes, I have this index of 4 thousand. Where does</span> <span data-start="1133.66" data-end="1143.14">that live in each quarter? I can do a bit-wise shift 11 which is not only like really performant,</span> <span data-start="1143.14" data-end="1150.37">because it is low-level JavaScript, but it makes me look like an elite hacker! This is</span> <span data-start="1150.37" data-end="1158.41">more code that renders bits. Look, it has got bit-shifting, modulus, multiplication,</span> <span data-start="1158.41" data-end="1167.9">maths. Yeah! Even awake/sleep at the end to make it go a little bit slower. With that,</span> <span data-start="1167.9" data-end="1175.93">I can now render all of these super old deprecated formats. These are deal .screen files from</span> <span data-start="1175.93" data-end="1186.03">the world of, real dot screen files. Manic Miners was one of the early games. I've got,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1186.03" data-end="1195.2">Chase HQ before there are others. So now I can support really old awful image formats.</span> <span data-start="1195.2" data-end="1207.29">Yeah. Like I say, Web P — done. The internet is littered with pictures of cats. I'm going</span> <span data-start="1207.29" data-end="1214.23">to fix that as well. I'm going to fix the old existing old new images, and oldify them,</span> <span data-start="1214.23" data-end="1222.1">okay? This is this really like I won't say beautiful aspect of these Spectrum images,</span> <span data-start="1222.1" data-end="1225.95">because of the way that the pixels are rendered, there's a thing called attribute clash where</span> <span data-start="1225.95" data-end="1231.88">where the screen is divided into eight by eight blocks, and you can only have two colours</span> <span data-start="1231.88" data-end="1239.35">on the Spectrum, so you get these detailed colour that would can't — it doesn't bleed</span> <span data-start="1239.35" data-end="1245.12">into, like, other eight by eight blocks. You can only have two colours there, okay? So,</span> <span data-start="1245.12" data-end="1252.02">fair enough, take a picture of my cat. I can use a canvas API to mangle the bits. I'm going</span> <span data-start="1252.02" data-end="1256.89">to take an image and put that into a canvas. So relatively speaking, that is straightforward.</span> <span data-start="1256.89" data-end="1263.69">I'm going to resize it down to 256 by 192 because that's how big images should be. I'm</span> <span data-start="1263.69" data-end="1271.4">going to use the Atkinson — Atkinson? — Atkinson dither algorithm to get the colours to shift</span> <span data-start="1271.4" data-end="1278.15">across to the 15 colours that the Spectrum has which is easy-ish if you know how to copy</span> <span data-start="1278.15" data-end="1286.76">and paste correctly — which is how I code! Then determine which getting rid of the other</span> <span data-start="1286.76" data-end="1292.4">colours, and work out which bits of the Inc. And which is the paper, and then ditch the</span> <span data-start="1292.4" data-end="1296.79">other colours to make it work, which was a little bit more complicated. I think I kept</span> <span data-start="1296.79" data-end="1308.15">throwing code at it until I got something. So this is my Twitter avatar loading it into</span> <span data-start="1308.15" data-end="1321.96">the page. Okay. So, my eyeball. So this is just a regular image. Then I do the dither</span> <span data-start="1321.96" data-end="1326.831">algorithm, okay, and I've literally no idea how it works. I just literally copied and</span> <span data-start="1326.831" data-end="1333.46">pasted and changed colours. I ended up with this. The 8x8 block has got four colours in</span> <span data-start="1333.46" data-end="1341.79">it. I can't do four colours on a Spectrum because it will look too good. I find the</span> <span data-start="1341.79" data-end="1347.22">two most popular colours — in this case, black and grey — and I basically absorb</span> <span data-start="1347.22" data-end="1352.38">— no, I think black and red. It is going to be a fight. I absorb the other colours</span> <span data-start="1352.38" data-end="1359.48">into those pixels, and I end up with this nightmare mask. [Laughter]. But this is the</span> <span data-start="1359.48" data-end="1365.72">attribute mask, and in this 8x8 block I only have pitch else that are on and off and put</span> <span data-start="1365.72" data-end="1372.96">the popular ones back in and I end up with a compatible image, and I have oldified an</span> <span data-start="1372.96" data-end="1383.03">image. I can see this with JSConf? You can see with JSConf the attribute clash just here</span> <span data-start="1383.03" data-end="1389.28">where you can see I've got a darker magenta, and a lighter magenta because of the white,</span> <span data-start="1389.28" data-end="1399.36">like the bright bit makes it white. Anyway. So, I'm now able to make images old, okay?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1399.36" data-end="1407.01">You can clap for that if you want to. You don't have to. Just saying. [Applause]. Okay,</span> <span data-start="1407.01" data-end="1415.45">so, we're now able to make the whole of the expert awful. I can now wire this up. I can</span> <span data-start="1415.45" data-end="1425.73">take my oldify technique, take my mobile phone, take an audio cable, in theory, plug it in</span> <span data-start="1425.73" data-end="1434.07">my lap tap, go through the audio process, listen, load the bars, and render an old picture</span> <span data-start="1434.07" data-end="1441.72">of all of you on my computer. That's the plan. The first time I did this, I have got the</span> <span data-start="1441.72" data-end="1450.261">code working, and I will just plug it into the computer. Right. Turn my volume up. Turn</span> <span data-start="1450.261" data-end="1455.49">your volume down over in the corner. Yes, it's going to be some sounds. I will turn</span> <span data-start="1455.49" data-end="1466.961">mine down a bit. So the first time I ran it, this happened. [Broken electronic tone]. It</span> <span data-start="1466.961" data-end="1478.79">does a weird submarine thing. And actually, unsurprisingly computers are really smart.</span> <span data-start="1478.79" data-end="1483.76">The microphones on your phone and in your computers are designed to get rid of background</span> <span data-start="1483.76" data-end="1491.73">noise, which is what I'm generating. So it hears the noise, and it goes, "No, no, no.</span> <span data-start="1491.73" data-end="1499.7">We're not having that!" So, after a lot of digging around, eventually, I found the echo</span> <span data-start="1499.7" data-end="1509.99">cancellation, so, if I listen to that. [Continuous electronic tone]. You can see that I've got</span> <span data-start="1509.99" data-end="1515.37">a perfect sample now. With the echo cancellation turned off, I've turned off the call features</span> <span data-start="1515.37" data-end="1525.89">in my laptop, I was able to get the awful sound working properly. Okay, so, do a little</span> <span data-start="1525.89" data-end="1532.59">refresh. So this is my a canvas Spectrum that I made. It's really nothing more than some</span> <span data-start="1532.59" data-end="1537.4">text and something to listen to the key. The first thing I need to do is take a photo of</span> <span data-start="1537.4" data-end="1559">you. I will take a photo first. Great. Smile. Smile! Yep. Ready. On three, one, two, three.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1559" data-end="1564.69">Weeey! Yes, I technology it's okay, you've got your eyes open. That's cool. I have the</span> <span data-start="1564.69" data-end="1572.35">photo on here. I'm going to plug it into the awed Joe Jack. I have to get — the audio</span> <span data-start="1572.35" data-end="1583.5">jack. From the tape, you have to do empty quotes because, I don't know, 1980s. I'm going</span> <span data-start="1583.5" data-end="1597.47">to hit enter and then play. [Continuous electronic tone]. I also find that, sometimes, it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1597.47" data-end="1606.42">work. I've been able to replicate bugs occasionally. This is just like I have to hope it works.</span> <span data-start="1606.42" data-end="1613.12">[Screeching electronic sound]. Kind of looks like — it doesn't look like anything what</span> <span data-start="1613.12" data-end="1619.54">my phone looks like. We have to wait for this. Debugging this, I had to listen to this over</span> <span data-start="1619.54" data-end="1626.12">and over again! [Laughter]. You can't just fast-forward it. In fact, actually, the bit</span> <span data-start="1626.12" data-end="1631.63">that I built is the only bit in all the emulated machines don't want to build. I built the</span> <span data-start="1631.63" data-end="1646.1">bit that no-one wants. In real games, they skip this bit for reasons. Are you ready?</span> <span data-start="1646.1" data-end="1669.17">This is it. [Cheering and Applause]. [Applause]. Pretty cool! I can barely recognise any of</span> <span data-start="1669.17" data-end="1674.27">you, to be fair, but it worked, right? I know what you're thinking: I did this on a computer,</span> <span data-start="1674.27" data-end="1680.55">right? What about an original 1982ZX Spectrum? Yes, I got it working in there as well. This</span> <span data-start="1680.55" data-end="1687.41">is a video from home. I didn't dare bring this in. In the corner is a ZX Spectrum from</span> <span data-start="1687.41" data-end="1696.02">1982, made in 1982, filmed today. I've got the audio jack of my laptop into it. What</span> <span data-start="1696.02" data-end="1700.72">it is rendering on the screen is actually rendered inside the Spectrum self so I can</span> <span data-start="1700.72" data-end="1710.45">talk really old language for no good whatsoever, but it worked on a real Spectrum 2. If anyone</span> <span data-start="1710.45" data-end="1720.41">needs to put old images on a Spectrum, come and see me. [Cheering and Applause]. So I'm</span> <span data-start="1720.41" data-end="1729.01">slightly over time, but the question of why: quite honestly, this comes up for myself quite</span> <span data-start="1729.01" data-end="1734.06">often. Every few months, I have this crisis of faith, and I'm quite prepared just to chuck</span> <span data-start="1734.06" data-end="1740.671">it all away because really there is no point to any of this in some respects. But, some</span> <span data-start="1740.671" data-end="1745.92">of the — sometimes, I work this these side projects for love, like JS Bin. I love the</span> <span data-start="1745.92" data-end="1750.56">project, but at times I hate the project, and that's not a great relationship, either.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1750.56" data-end="1756.4">That's not the why. Other times, I've worked on side projects and it brings in client work</span> <span data-start="1756.4" data-end="1762.14">and paid work because I work for myself. That's not normally the why, why I do these kind</span> <span data-start="1762.14" data-end="1771.06">of things. The why is because I enjoy kind of using code to be creative for myself, and</span> <span data-start="1771.06" data-end="1777.47">I enjoy puzzle-solving, and I enjoy learning new problems, new failings, if that makes</span> </p>
