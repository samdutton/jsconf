quickly</span> <span data-start="185.59" data-end="188.2">create an HTML page created a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="188.2" data-end="189.73">page linked them together and then just</span> <span data-start="189.73" data-end="192.79">started coding right so now if you</span> <span data-start="192.79" data-end="194.59">actually want to do that in order to do</span> <span

<p><span data-start="280.389" data-end="282.729">Global's anymore and B this is going to</span> <span data-start="282.729" data-end="284.68">cut out so much your grunt file and only</span> <span data-start="284.68" data-end="285.939">cut out a hundred lines of the grunt</span> <span data-start="285.939" data-end="288.069">file and then of course they ended up</span> <span data-start="288.069" data-end="289.96">having to have an AMD config file which</span> <span data-start="289.96" data-end="292.12">was 70 lines of code so so here's the</span> <span data-start="292.12" data-end="295.81">grunt file right here yeah so this is</span> <span data-start="295.81" data-end="298">this is a grub file and this is all you</span> <span data-start="298" data-end="299.409">know they did the research this is the</span> <span data-start="299.409" data-end="301.21">best practices stuff you know their mana</span> <span data-start="301.21" data-end="302.919">fiying all the things you know that</span> <span data-start="302.919" data-end="304.84">they're they're using less and</span> <span data-start="304.84" data-end="307.75">preprocessing it you know here's their</span> <span data-start="307.75" data-end="310.12">you know main DJ s so that they can they</span> <span data-start="310.12" data-end="313.69">can have AMD modules in the browser and</span> <span data-start="313.69" data-end="315.699">then there can you know the testing</span> <span data-start="315.699" data-end="316.99">config you know then they had to have</span> <span data-start="316.99" data-end="318.58">testing the fig and this is actually the</span> <span data-start="318.58" data-end="320.379">pared-down testing config that they had</span> <span data-start="320.379" data-end="326.349">so so can we simplify this mess and my</span> <span data-start="326.349" data-end="329.229">answer is yes we need to and if you've</span> <span data-start="329.229" data-end="331.449">been coding in java recently I know if</span> <span data-start="331.449" data-end="333.4">anybody has but you know this this code</span> <span data-start="333.4" data-end="335.349">that I'm showing up here reminds me a</span> <span data-start="335.349" data-end="338.5">lot of you know maven code or XML files</span> <span data-start="338.5" data-end="340.449">all the stuff that you used to have to</span> <span data-start="340.449" data-end="342.58">do in Java and I say used to because</span> <span data-start="342.58" data-end="344.469">this is a new projects out there one of</span> <span data-start="344.469" data-end="346.93">them from pivotal spring boot which</span> <span data-start="346.93" data-end="349.779">eliminates all of it so you basically</span> <span data-start="349.779" data-end="352.24">have no more XML no more you know</span> <span data-start="352.24" data-end="354.009">configuration you just get started and</span> <span data-start="354.009" data-end="356.86">so you know my boss has come to me and</span> <span data-start="356.86" data-end="359.11">say what the hell why do we have to do</span> <span data-start="359.11" data-end="361.12">this stuff in JavaScript still so so now</span> <span data-start="361.12" data-end="364.21">my job is to to try to eliminate all</span> <span data-start="364.21" data-end="366.069">this configuration mess that we have to</span> <span data-start="366.069" data-end="369.219">do in javascript so that's where rave</span> <span data-start="369.219" data-end="372.43">comes in so what is rave I'll tell you</span> <span data-start="372.43" data-end="374.11">right now it's not a new framework</span> <span data-start="374.11" data-end="376.36">you're not a rave global you're going to</span> <span data-start="376.36" data-end="378.19">code to you don't have to require rave</span> <span data-start="378.19" data-end="379.93">in your code actually we're not going to</span> <span data-start="379.93" data-end="382.089">touch your code at all so it's not</span> <span data-start="382.089" data-end="383.919">another loader it's not not an AMD</span> <span data-start="383.919" data-end="385.99">loader but it does have a loader built</span> <span data-start="385.99" data-end="388.21">in actually it has an es6 style loader</span> <span data-start="388.21" data-end="391.779">and it uses a shim built by guy bedford</span> <span data-start="391.779" data-end="393.49">who's here somewhere so pat him on the</span> <span data-start="393.49" data-end="395.349">back next time you see them he's doing</span> <span data-start="395.349" data-end="397.839">an excellent job on an es6 loader shim</span> <span data-start="397.839" data-end="399.639">so that you it's built for the future</span> <span data-start="399.639" data-end="402.37">you can load things like AMD you can</span> <span data-start="402.37" data-end="403.27">load common j</span> <span data-start="403.27" data-end="405.28">pretty soon you'll be able to load es6</span> <span data-start="405.28" data-end="406.84">and rave and you can load other things</span> <span data-start="406.84" data-end="408.07">to a lot of things you're used to</span> <span data-start="408.07" data-end="410.14">loading if you're using AMD now you can</span> <span data-start="410.14" data-end="413.8">load CSS text Jason whatever but</span> <span data-start="413.8" data-end="414.85">unfortunately it's not ready for</span> <span data-start="414.85" data-end="416.29">production yet you know you can play</span> <span data-start="416.29" data-end="419.38">with it now and we have again probably</span> <span data-start="419.38" data-end="421.15">about a third of the way to where we</span> <span data-start="421.15" data-end="422.83">want to be and at about two thirds of</span> <span data-start="422.83" data-end="424.3">the way we're going to say yes this is</span> <span data-start="424.3" data-end="426.28">ready for you to use so probably about</span> <span data-start="426.28" data-end="428.83">another four to six weeks I'm going to</span> <span data-start="428.83" data-end="430.48">try to get it in less than that but</span> <span data-start="430.48" data-end="431.77">let's see and we want your feedback</span> <span data-start="431.77" data-end="433.39">that's why I'm here today I want</span> <span data-start="433.39" data-end="434.8">feedback I want you guys to come tell me</span> <span data-start="434.8" data-end="437.29">and say this sucks you know this is not</span> <span data-start="437.29" data-end="439.15">the way we want to do things and and</span> <span data-start="439.15" data-end="440.71">we're going to try to accommodate you</span> <span data-start="440.71" data-end="442.54">and a comment people that maybe love it</span> <span data-start="442.54" data-end="446.86">so okay so what are we trying to do and</span> <span data-start="446.86" data-end="449.8">three bullets provide a default you know</span> <span data-start="449.8" data-end="452.53">instantly out-of-the-box configuration</span> <span data-start="452.53" data-end="454.45">you install rave bag you've got</span> <span data-start="454.45" data-end="455.8">something to run you've got a nap it's a</span> <span data-start="455.8" data-end="457.51">simple app it just it's basically a</span> <span data-start="457.51" data-end="460.21">hello world app but you've got something</span> <span data-start="460.21" data-end="462.22">and you can just immediately start start</span> <span data-start="462.22" data-end="465.27">doing something make it easy then to get</span> <span data-start="465.27" data-end="467.35">sophisticated you know start doing</span> <span data-start="467.35" data-end="469.81">things like the advanced testing install</span> <span data-start="469.81" data-end="472.54">your favorite favorite framework start</span> <span data-start="472.54" data-end="474.07">doing trance piling and that kind of</span> <span data-start="474.07" data-end="476.32">stuff makes it brain dead easy to start</span> <span data-start="476.32" data-end="478.15">doing that and then make it easy to</span> <span data-start="478.15" data-end="479.74">assert your own opinion again we don't</span> <span data-start="479.74" data-end="482.35">want to you know we have to impose some</span> <span data-start="482.35" data-end="484.36">opinion but we want that to be extremely</span> <span data-start="484.36" data-end="490.66">minimal so one of the ways to get a</span> <span data-start="490.66" data-end="494.02">default you know runnable configuration</span> <span data-start="494.02" data-end="495.55">is through something called a rave</span> <span data-start="495.55" data-end="497.14">starter and basically it's just a repo</span> <span data-start="497.14" data-end="499.54">on github you just go and you you</span> <span data-start="499.54" data-end="502.18">download it and you just you know follow</span> <span data-start="502.18" data-end="503.77">the instructions it's very simple</span> <span data-start="503.77" data-end="505.6">instructions just then launch a favorite</span> <span data-start="505.6" data-end="507.88">browser open up a favor editor ready and</span> <span data-start="507.88" data-end="509.44">you get started but there's also a way</span> <span data-start="509.44" data-end="511.03">to start from scratch and if I have some</span> <span data-start="511.03" data-end="512.71">time i'm going to show you both methods</span> <span data-start="512.71" data-end="514.42">actually how to start from scratch just</span> <span data-start="514.42" data-end="517.69">by typing in npm in it or bower in it</span> <span data-start="517.69" data-end="521.38">and starting from there so the way this</span> <span data-start="521.38" data-end="523.18">works the reason is no build step is</span> <span data-start="523.18" data-end="525.22">because the runtime by default is</span> <span data-start="525.22"
