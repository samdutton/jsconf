<span data-start="841.19" data-end="843.35">problems for a lot more people so during</span> <span data-start="843.35" data-end="844.49">the last six months we have been</span> <span

data-end="851.48">consolidate this API that we that we are</span> <span data-start="851.48" data-end="853.91">proud of in addition we have a new</span> <span data-start="853.91" data-end="859.45">random new compiler so one of the most</span> <span data-start="859.45" data-end="861.74">interesting things about the stencil is</span> <span data-start="861.74" data-end="864.77">that when you instance this about</span> <span data-start="864.77" data-end="866.54">components right so you're not using it</span> <span data-start="866.54" data-end="870.68">muscle time to create an app right so</span> <span data-start="870.68" data-end="872.24">how will you handle the list logging</span> <span data-start="872.24" data-end="873.35">because most of the time is about</span> <span data-start="873.35" data-end="876.29">routing it's a routing based list loaded</span> <span data-start="876.29" data-end="879.2">but here we can have that so instead we</span> <span data-start="879.2" data-end="880.7">took a different approach is a component</span> <span data-start="880.7" data-end="883.31">based lazy loading because we want to</span> <span data-start="883.31" data-end="885.35">use a stencil to build this components</span> <span data-start="885.35" data-end="886.64">but they will be used in different</span> <span data-start="886.64" data-end="889.31">places

<p><span data-start="890.41" data-end="893.87">Yanik angular they have different ways</span> <span data-start="893.87" data-end="896.9">of lace noise so in order to do that in</span> <span data-start="896.9" data-end="898.85">stencil is able to perform the static</span> <span data-start="898.85" data-end="901.67">analysis of how the components depend on</span> <span data-start="901.67" data-end="903.86">each other and apply the best</span> <span data-start="903.86" data-end="905.63">optimizations and the real person things</span> <span data-start="905.63" data-end="910.43">have to deal with it so in sensor one we</span> <span data-start="910.43" data-end="912.44">have a new algorithm in spiral a</span> <span data-start="912.44" data-end="914.24">matching learning technique called war</span> <span data-start="914.24" data-end="915.47">embeddings and I'm going to explain</span> <span data-start="915.47" data-end="917.839">because kind of weird but the thing is</span> <span data-start="917.839" data-end="921.95">that our use case all the components are</span> <span data-start="921.95" data-end="924.5">entry points because we don't know how</span> <span data-start="924.5" data-end="928.19">they are going to be used so like</span> <span data-start="928.19" data-end="930.89">traditional tacking algorithms like the</span> <span data-start="930.89" data-end="933.86">one using webpack or or OLAP give</span> <span data-start="933.86" data-end="935.36">generate a different bundle for this</span> <span data-start="935.36" data-end="936.92">application for each component if you</span> <span data-start="936.92" data-end="939.41">want to lazy low them so if you have 20</span> <span data-start="939.41" data-end="941.06">different components at the same time</span> <span data-start="941.06" data-end="942.86">you will have to download 20 different</span> <span data-start="942.86" data-end="946.73">files so we come up with a new guram to</span> <span data-start="946.73" data-end="950.269">to make this feature so in this image we</span> <span data-start="950.269" data-end="952.22">have nine components and we use numbers</span> <span data-start="952.22" data-end="954.589">to name them but you could imagine Deng</span> <span data-start="954.589" data-end="956.269">has paid login base tutorial I button</span> <span data-start="956.269" data-end="959.12">wherever so thanks to the static</span> <span data-start="959.12" data-end="961.1">analysis I said before like of how</span> <span data-start="961.1" data-end="963.05">components depend of each other like how</span> <span data-start="963.05" data-end="964.7">they are using the templates we can</span> <span data-start="964.7" data-end="967.19">extract information of the dependencies</span> <span data-start="967.19" data-end="969.17">which are components and that's what</span> <span data-start="969.17" data-end="972.589">these lines represent alright so the</span> <span data-start="972.589" data-end="974.87">next step is to resolve the transitive</span> <span data-start="974.87" data-end="977.99">dependencies so for example if we know</span> <span data-start="977.99" data-end="981.17">that the component 1 depends on 3 and if</span> <span data-start="981.17" data-end="983.45">3 depends on 6 that means that by the</span> <span data-start="983.45" data-end="986.39">transitive property that 1 also depends</span> <span data-start="986.39" data-end="989.649">on 6 oh damn it</span> <span data-start="989.649" data-end="993.82">ok make sense everyone yes</span> <span data-start="993.82" data-end="998.57">ok so we keep we basically do the same</span> <span data-start="998.57" data-end="1002.17">with all the components ok so let's</span> <span data-start="1002.17" data-end="1004.06">focus and then a component number 9 it</span> <span data-start="1004.06" data-end="1006.76">has a lot of arrows pointing to it that</span> <span data-start="1006.76" data-end="1008.64">means that it has a lot of dependence</span> <span data-start="1008.64" data-end="1011.769">but some component like 5 doesn't have</span> <span data-start="1011.769" data-end="1015.399">any okay let's focus again in the</span> <span data-start="1015.399" data-end="1017.8">component 9 as I said each arrow</span> <span data-start="1017.8" data-end="1021.22">represents dependent so in this case we</span> <span data-start="1021.22" data-end="1023.529">collect the dependence of nine so in</span> <span data-start="1023.529" data-end="1025.62">yeah it's three one six four and two</span> <span data-start="1025.62" data-end="1029.079">right where these lines are coming from</span> <span data-start="1029.079" data-end="1032.709">and we do the same with all of them</span> <span data-start="1032.709" data-end="1035.919">understood yeah yes</span> <span data-start="1035.919" data-end="1040.689">ok so let's focus again in the component</span> <span data-start="1040.689" data-end="1042.579">number nine there were just four</span> <span data-start="1042.579" data-end="1046.449">examples so we have let's get the</span> <span data-start="1046.449" data-end="1051.309">dependencies so we go we get already all</span> <span data-start="1051.309" data-end="1053.559">the data but we just have to encode it</span> <span data-start="1053.559" data-end="1055.96">in different data structure so what if</span> <span data-start="1055.96" data-end="1058.63">we could what if we can convert these</span> <span data-start="1058.63" data-end="1060.73">dependencies of each component into a</span> <span data-start="1060.73" data-end="1062.89">vector just like word embeddings will do</span> <span data-start="1062.89" data-end="1067.13">with words so we have</span> <span data-start="1067.13" data-end="1069.41">so for example the component number</span> <span data-start="1069.41" data-end="1072.2">let's let's encode one let's put a 1</span> <span data-start="1072.2" data-end="1074.39">when it's a dependent and nasarah when</span> <span data-start="1074.39" data-end="1078.38">it's not so 1 it's a component it's a</span> <span data-start="1078.38" data-end="1082.429">dependent or not it is right yeah ok so</span> <span data-start="1082.429" data-end="1087.289">one two three four years or well but</span> <span data-start="1087.289" data-end="1090.679">five five is not we don't have any arrow</span> <span data-start="1090.679" data-end="1094.58">pointing to 6 so we linked all with 0 6</span> <span data-start="1094.58" data-end="1100.669">it is and 7 8 9 is not okay well we do</span> <span data-start="1100.669" data-end="1102.35">the same with all the components and we</span> <span data-start="1102.35" data-end="1107.059">get an array of vectors so what we had</span>

data-start="1722.52" data-end="1726.21">to check it out the stencil yes calm or</span> <span data-start="1726.21" data-end="1728.01">just npm in it the stencil I'll give you</span> <span data-start="1728.01" data-end="1732.45">a try yeah it's like magic</span> <span data-start="1732.45" data-end="1738.51">so thank you</span> </p>
