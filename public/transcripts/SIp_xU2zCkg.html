<p><span data-start="438.89" data-end="442.57">So fixing issues on the website, raising awareness with your peers.</span> <span data-start="442.57" data-end="447.689">You know, you may go through this same struggle if you're working on things like security,</span> <span data-start="447.689" data-end="451.84">maintainability, maybe you're super into testing, you've got to be sure that you're raising</span> <span data-start="451.84" data-end="460.139">awareness within your peers, as well as consulting, tools, analysis, for analysis, providing  —  supporting</span> <span data-start="460.139" data-end="461.28">platforms.</span> <span data-start="461.28" data-end="467.069">One of the first things I did when I started focusing front-end performance within my organization</span> <span data-start="467.069" data-end="478.669">is I just started capturing PSI data because I thought that was really important for reasons</span> <span data-start="478.669" data-end="481.569">that I'll talk about later.</span> <span data-start="481.569" data-end="484.639">And just all of the things you have to do.</span> <span data-start="484.639" data-end="491.689">And it's  —  and it's pretty intense, you know, especially if you're a smaller shop, and you</span> <span data-start="491.689" data-end="496.439">may have all of this within your organization, but you still need to provide that consulting</span> <span data-start="496.439" data-end="502.27">to your peers to make sure they're aware of the tooling and of the structure that's there.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="502.27" data-end="504.97">Performance is critical on the web.</span> <span data-start="504.97" data-end="510.449">I'm not going to talk too much about this, but CPU are getting really fast.</span> <span data-start="510.449" data-end="519.27">We have blazing fast mobile devices, but you know, not everyone has that, and most of the</span> <span data-start="519.27" data-end="525.91">cell phone adoption right now is happening with like new people buying cell phones who</span> <span data-start="525.91" data-end="534.76">haven't had cell phones before, are buying low to medium-tier devices, so it's super</span> <span data-start="534.76" data-end="539.18">important going into the future.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="606.089" data-end="610.47">It gave me tons of case studies to show to my leadership.</span> <span data-start="610.47" data-end="617.329">And, you know, you know, you could  —  don't do an A/B test for it.</span> <span data-start="617.329" data-end="621.35">Look to other studies, seriously, because it's very difficult.</span> <span data-start="621.35" data-end="628.899">I don't recommend it, And you're ignoring a key part of the equation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="628.899" data-end="634.81">There's a lot to it, it's very complex, but, you know, SEO is a big factor to revenue,</span> <span data-start="634.81" data-end="642.8">so where you're, you know, with Google having tools like Lighthouse and PHP insights being</span> <span data-start="642.8" data-end="647.37">directly factored into your page rank score, this is one of the key pieces of advice that</span> <span data-start="647.37" data-end="654.94">you know, Google lets you know is a big impact.</span> <span data-start="654.94" data-end="658.18">So I forgot some things.</span> <span data-start="658.18" data-end="661.48">In that big list of all the things and that's regression.</span> <span data-start="661.48" data-end="667.959">So it's  —  it's easy to accidentally, you know, you have a project where you need to</span> <span data-start="667.959" data-end="673.54">convert a timezone, so you pull in a moment and then you realized that you need moment</span> <span data-start="673.54" data-end="681.279">timezone plugin and then that pulls in literally all of the geographical latitude and longitude</span> <span data-start="681.279" data-end="686.649">information about the timezone lines that you didn't know about, and wasn't documented.</span> <span data-start="686.649" data-end="692.55">So it can be an easy mistake to make, and you need tools to support you throughout that.</span> <span data-start="692.55" data-end="698.82">And also, it's about scalability, as well, it's kind of a weird term to use in this sense,</span> <span data-start="698.82" data-end="702.589">but I think about organizational scalability.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.589" data-end="709.519">You can't be there for everything as, you know, maybe that one or maybe there's a couple</span> <span data-start="709.519" data-end="715.11">performance experts and you have this large organization, or a large project, so I tend</span> <span data-start="715.11" data-end="718.07">to speak within the context of organizations.</span> <span data-start="718.07" data-end="722.72">But you may be working on an open source project where performance is absolutely critical.</span> <span data-start="722.72" data-end="726.25">It may be for Mobile Web.</span> <span data-start="726.25" data-end="729.79">And I'm still probably forgetting tons of things.</span> <span data-start="729.79" data-end="733.63">So what are performance budgets?</span> <span data-start="733.63" data-end="735.99">It is what it sounds like.</span> <span data-start="735.99" data-end="742.93">You define something like a budget.json, you can specify some things.</span> <span data-start="742.93" data-end="747.11">Typically you might want to failure build.</span> <span data-start="747.11" data-end="750.529">It's a bit of a touchy subject to roll out to your organization, but I'll talk about</span> <span data-start="750.529" data-end="752.08">that a little bit later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.08" data-end="756.54">How can performance budgets help?</span> <span data-start="756.54" data-end="760.44">First of all, it gets the conversation started.</span> <span data-start="760.44" data-end="764.79">When you introduce performance budgets into your organization or project, you're immediately</span> <span data-start="764.79" data-end="768.97">going to start talking about performance, which is immediate when?</span> <span data-start="768.97" data-end="773.19">But what's more important, and one of the keys to performance budgeting is it keeps</span> <span data-start="773.19" data-end="780.23">the conversation going, so this is, you know, when you're introducing a new feature and</span> <span data-start="780.23" data-end="786.22">then you roll it out and then it fails to build, you're like, oh, well, lesson learned,</span> <span data-start="786.22" data-end="792.199">I'm going to make sure that I bring up this conversation a little bit early, because it's</span> <span data-start="792.199" data-end="796.22">kind of pushed our project a little bit out.</span> <span data-start="796.22" data-end="798.99">You're making explicit tradeoffs.</span> <span data-start="798.99" data-end="808.699">Instead of implicitly kind of making that tradeoff, you're being direct and more  —  you're</span> <span data-start="808.699" data-end="809.81">being more direct about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="809.81" data-end="814.82">There has been a conversation, there has been a commit, maybe you even bump your budget.</span> <span data-start="814.82" data-end="815.82">That's OK.</span> <span data-start="815.82" data-end="816.98">It works like that in real life.</span> <span data-start="816.98" data-end="822.42">If you've ever tried budgeting and like going on a hard core budget, the first thing you</span> <span data-start="822.42" data-end="826.48">do is overrestrict yourself.</span> <span data-start="826.48" data-end="831.17">And you adjust, and that's OK.</span> <span data-start="831.17" data-end="836.85">But it's being explicit about it that kind of helps out with the situation and it prevents</span> <span data-start="836.85" data-end="837.85">accidents.</span> <span data-start="837.85" data-end="840.269">This is one of the biggest things for me.</span> <span data-start="840.269" data-end="845.389">So there's a lot of different things that you can budget on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.389" data-end="848.44">So there's score-based metrics.</span> <span data-start="848.44" data-end="852.62">If you're using something like Lighthouse you might be familiar with, it gives you an</span> <span data-start="852.62" data-end="857.69">overall performance score, so you can assert on that.</span> <span data-start="857.69" data-end="864.079">So if your SEO is critical to your organization and you need that traffic coming in to make</span> <span data-start="864.079" data-end="872.06">your revenue, you know, that score is going to be important, so your SEO team might even</span> <span data-start="872.06" data-end="875.62">demand that and then there's quantitative.</span> <span data-start="875.62" data-end="877.639">So this is about numbers.</span> <span data-start="877.639" data-end="885.449">It's about how many kilobytes of JavaScript do we think we really need?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="885.449" data-end="888.029">And kind of asserting against that.</span> <span data-start="888.029" data-end="892.74">It can be how many images you have on your home page?</span> <span data-start="892.74" data-end="897.31">And maybe it will remind you that oh, I need to lazy load.</span> <span data-start="897.31" data-end="901.079">That's one of the things that, like, I do as consulting within my organization.</span> </p>
