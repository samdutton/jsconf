<p><span data-start="383.87" data-end="390.19">Prior to there being one primary foundation, it wasn't really clear.</span> <span data-start="390.19" data-end="397.78">And it's hard because Node was the main project in the node.js Foundation, and joining something</span> <span data-start="397.78" data-end="403.28">bigger means giving some stuff up, and there's an anecdote I really like.</span> <span data-start="403.28" data-end="410.8">When I kind of started getting into the node.js ecosystem, when I had just moved to California,</span> <span data-start="410.8" data-end="417.52">I got — I got a free ticket to go to a conference called Node Summit.</span> <span data-start="417.52" data-end="421.681">This was right around the time of the fork, and they were talking about merging, and I</span> <span data-start="421.681" data-end="427.07">have no shame, so I walked right up to Scott Hammond at the time the CEO of Joyant and</span> <span data-start="427.07" data-end="429.41">asked him why would you put Node?</span> <span data-start="429.41" data-end="431.93">A foundation — in a foundation?</span> <span data-start="431.93" data-end="437.55">He said it's better to have a smaller piece of a bigger pie.</span> <span data-start="437.55" data-end="442.66">To me, when I think about these foundations, and we just had our summit recently which</span> <span data-start="442.66" data-end="448.23">was fantastic, and so many new faces in the room that weren't there before, we just massively</span> <span data-start="448.23" data-end="452.77">expanded the scope of the work that we can do, who we can work with, how we can work</span> <span data-start="452.77" data-end="453.77">with them.</span> <span data-start="453.77" data-end="460.24">We get to revisit all of these kind of preconceived notions when Node first went in the foundation,</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="461.43">it was very reactive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="461.43" data-end="466.31">We had things that we needed to protect and fix and now we can be proactive and start</span> <span data-start="466.31" data-end="468.49">thinking about what we want to build.</span> <span data-start="468.49" data-end="474.36"Audience member: It made me think we all know we can accomplish a lot more than we could on our own as an</span> <span data-start="474.36" data-end="478.28">individual, so it's the same thing for a larger foundation.</span> <span data-start="478.28" data-end="483.37"Audience member: And sort of wearing the Node hat, there was a lot of scepticism when we were talking</span> <span data-start="483.37" data-end="486.92">about a merger.</span> <span data-start="486.92" data-end="489.75">And not — I wouldn't necessarily say it was balanced.</span> <span data-start="489.75" data-end="495.02">There was a lot from the Node side, and, again, it was because we had experience going through</span> <span data-start="495.02" data-end="500.8">I think a pretty tumultuous foundation formation not too many years ago, and Node was finally</span> <span data-start="500.8" data-end="506.28">feeling like a stable place sort of firing on all cylinders, we were working together</span> <span data-start="506.28" data-end="513.13">in the community, and the TSC, but I think as part of that, we ended up seeing how bringing</span> <span data-start="513.13" data-end="520.12">in the up stream components in the JS ecosystem, that, like, we were stronger when we were</span> <span data-start="520.12" data-end="525.53">doing that together, and so by focusing on these sorts of things that we had already</span> <span data-start="525.53" data-end="530.56">learned, transparency, including not — not just including — giving autonomy to the project</span> <span data-start="530.56" data-end="536.44">members so they could run and host these meetings, we ran weekly meetings when it came to the</span> <span data-start="536.44" data-end="541.25">merger discussion and planning so whatever wanted to drive the planning from particular</span> <span data-start="541.25" data-end="547.09">initiative phases of making this merger happen, it was only going to happen if people showed</span> <span data-start="547.09" data-end="550.98">up and did the work, and that is from the project side, not from the board side.</span> <span data-start="550.98" data-end="557.84"Audience member: Yes, I will add that on the .just Foundation side, we immediately you a the benefit of</span> <span data-start="557.84" data-end="563.8">possibly merging with the Node ecosystem because all of our projects really rely on Node.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="563.8" data-end="571.75">At the same time, there was fear and uncertainty because there was a lot of historical drama,</span> <span data-start="571.75" data-end="577.84">and energy from the community which may be disruptive to what was otherwise fairly stability</span> <span data-start="577.84" data-end="578.84">projects.</span> <span data-start="578.84" data-end="587.33">So, you know, with that optimism, but cautious optimism in mind, everybody got really excited</span> <span data-start="587.33" data-end="592.65">about the possibility of collaborating more closely with their peers on the Node side</span> <span data-start="592.65" data-end="599.11">through one umbrella, and I think that's kind of what put us over the edge.</span> <span data-start="599.11" data-end="604.57"Audience member: And one of the things that building on what both Tracy and Jory was saying, from</span> <span data-start="604.57" data-end="610.32">the get-go, we approached this from an egalitarian mind set.</span> <span data-start="610.32" data-end="615.87">We made the doors open, like we tried to be hyper inclusive as much as possible.</span> <span data-start="615.87" data-end="622.391">If you are a member or a committer, and even then we weren't that picky, like, if you wanted</span> <span data-start="622.391" data-end="627.4">to show up to those meetings and you wasn't being disruptive, you had a voice and a seat</span> <span data-start="627.4" data-end="630.779">at the table, and were participating.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.779" data-end="634.83">I think that was really important to make sure that this could be successful.</span> <span data-start="634.83" data-end="640.18"Audience member: I was going to say, we looked at the governance for a number of the different projects, for</span> <span data-start="640.18" data-end="648.63">the Node Foundation, Kubernetes, and I'm happy that we ended up with something that is the</span> <span data-start="648.63" data-end="656.44">most, has the most opportunity, and hopefully the best place where people will want to come</span> <span data-start="656.44" data-end="658.62">and will attract a lot of good people through that.</span> <span data-start="658.62" data-end="662.92">I'm happy by looking at that, we ended up with that open and really nice governance.</span> <span data-start="662.92" data-end="669.97"Audience member: I think in all of this drives home the value of this work is always project-driven,</span> <span data-start="669.97" data-end="674.8">and that's the point of the foundation, is to help empower and give autonomy to the projects,</span> <span data-start="674.8" data-end="679.56">and get sort of the crap out of the way for them to be able to do their good work.</span> <span data-start="679.56" data-end="683.02"Audience member: I think what I've heard on that front is we talk about great projects and the focus</span> <span data-start="683.02" data-end="686.839">will be on those great projects, not the foundation itself.</span> <span data-start="686.839" data-end="689.43"Audience member: So let's dig into some of that nitty-gritty.</span> <span data-start="689.43" data-end="694.71">Almost everybody in the room here is an engineer, and I have always held the opinion that governance</span> <span data-start="694.71" data-end="698.41">is just coding but with words!</span> <span data-start="698.41" data-end="702.5">It's really what it has felt like over the past ten months, and we have a visual aid</span> <span data-start="702.5" data-end="703.96">here as we talk about it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="703.96" data-end="710.61">Let's dive into some of the more nitty-gritty details here of under the hood of what is</span> <span data-start="710.61" data-end="714.68">kind of making this foundation, new foundation tick, and we can talk about some of the back</span> <span data-start="714.68" data-end="720.1">story, and reasoning behind these sections of the foundation.</span> <span data-start="720.1" data-end="730.819">Yes, so, I mean, let's take it from the top and go OpenJS board and talk about their functionality.</span> <span data-start="730.819" data-end="736.4"Audience member: To start out with, I talked about the governance.</span> <span data-start="736.4" data-end="739.81">We have multiple levels so there are observers.</span> <span data-start="739.81" data-end="743.38">Any who wants to can come up and participate in the meetings.</span> <span data-start="743.38" data-end="747.27">We want to get as many different ideas to come to the best answers.</span> <span data-start="747.27" data-end="752.23">We have regular members who can actually, people who in my mind who said I'm making</span> <span data-start="752.23" data-end="756.75">a commitment to be involved regularly and they can they can be recognised for that.</span> <span data-start="756.75" data-end="762.89">Again, both observers and regular members are involved in all of the work that goes</span> <span data-start="762.89" data-end="763.92">on.</span> <span data-start="763.92" data-end="767.88">And then finally, we have voting members where in the rare cases where we need to actually</span> <span data-start="767.88" data-end="771.65">have a vote on something, it's that subset who will do that vote.</span> <span data-start="771.65" data-end="778.371">Now, our experience in the Node project at least has been that votes are very rare, we</span> <span data-start="778.371" data-end="782.9">follow a consensus-seeking approach, and really it's going to be all of those members who</span> <span data-start="782.9" data-end="787.57">have ownership and who push things forward, and so it should not really matter which level</span> <span data-start="787.57" data-end="793.53">you're in, but we have just to have the different levels for the contingencies.</span> <span data-start="793.53" data-end="799.39"Audience member: One thing that I can add, a mantra I would tell myself, was that we wanted to create</span> <span data-start="799.39" data-end="804.89">structures and hierarchies of responsibility rather than power.</span> </p>
