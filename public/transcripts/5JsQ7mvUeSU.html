<span data-start="373.6" data-end="379.24">set when we can and why we can use data</span> <span data-start="379.24" data-end="381.79">normalization in such cases so for</span> <span data-start="381.79" data-end="384.22">example we want to get some product body</span> <span data-start="384.22" data-end="388.57">so instead of accessing and traversing</span> <span data-start="388.57" data-end="391.09">through the list we just accessing it</span> <span data-start="391.09" data-end="394.06">through ID the same when we want to get</span> <span data-start="394.06"

<span data-start="409.75" data-end="413.139">or select our data so for example we</span> <span data-start="413.139" data-end="415.509">want to get a product body we have a</span> <span

data-start="497.62" data-end="502.569">improve so we can normalize our data</span> <span data-start="502.569" data-end="505.21">instead of list of products we can keep</span> <span data-start="505.21"
