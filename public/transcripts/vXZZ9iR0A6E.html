data-end="125.359">total hack and now it's growing into</span> <span data-start="125.359" data-end="126.95">something that is being used by</span> <span data-start="126.95"

data-end="136.88">big companies behind it so when we first</span> <span data-start="136.88" data-end="139.31">ship phonegap two years ago it was</span> <span data-start="139.31" data-end="141.29">essentially an extension on the native</span> <span data-start="141.29" data-end="143.93">web view and for iOS which was only</span> <span data-start="143.93" data-end="146.93">iphones at that time now we've got</span> <span data-start="146.93" data-end="149.93">support for our eight platforms eight</span> <span data-start="149.93" data-end="151.64">different mobile platforms for creating</span> <span data-start="151.64" data-end="154.37">native mobile web apps and we're getting</span> <span data-start="154.37"

data-start="182.99" data-end="184.57">big companies are supporting it so</span> <span data-start="184.57" data-end="187.04">that's pretty cool a lot of people ask</span> <span data-start="187.04" data-end="188.21">us like how many people are using</span> <span data-start="188.21" data-end="192.26">phonegap and we have no idea it's an</span> <span data-start="192.26" data-end="193.49">open

last January it's</span> <span data-start="197.72" data-end="198.8">been downloaded over</span> <span data-start="198.8" data-end="201.62">half a million times that's not</span> <span

data-start="206.15" data-end="208.01">write applications for ourselves and</span> <span data-start="208.01" data-end="210.14">we've shipped over 50 apps and last year</span> <span data-start="210.14" data-end="213.08">with a team of 15 people that's pretty</span> <span data-start="213.08" data-end="216.02">impressive phone guide gives you a huge</span> <span data-start="216.02" data-end="217.13">advantage because you could leverage</span> <span data-start="217.13" data-end="219.32">your your already existing skills for</span> <span data-start="219.32" data-end="221.57">the web to create apps faster than</span> <span data-start="221.57" data-end="223.85">anyone else and and really that's what</span> <span data-start="223.85" data-end="225.65">it's all about because most apps that we</span> <span data-start="225.65" data-end="228.52">have to write or do a few weeks ago</span> <span data-start="228.52" data-end="234.83">according to our clients so what one</span> <span data-start="234.83" data-end="238.49">thing about all this stuff is phonegap</span> <span data-start="238.49" data-end="240.53">is really more of an interim solution</span> <span data-start="240.53" data-end="244.37">then then something that we're saying</span> <span data-start="244.37" data-end="246.17">that you should be using from now on</span> <span data-start="246.17" data-end="250.76">moving forward phonegap is a platform</span> <span data-start="250.76" data-end="253.91">for writing web apps but really we</span> <span data-start="253.91" data-end="256.22">should just be writing web apps but</span> <span data-start="256.22" data-end="257.359">there's times when we can't write web</span> <span data-start="257.359" data-end="258.89">apps and that's when we want to access</span> <span data-start="258.89" data-end="261.2">native device features such as the file</span> <span data-start="261.2" data-end="263.6">system or if we want to access the</span> <span data-start="263.6" data-end="265.22">contacts or the camera or any of this</span> <span data-start="265.22" data-end="267.65">other cool stuff and so phonegap really</span> <span data-start="267.65" data-end="269.78">is just an interim solution the browsers</span> <span data-start="269.78" data-end="271.01">are going to be doing this stuff</span> <span data-start="271.01" data-end="273.47">eventually anyways and geolocation is a</span> <span data-start="273.47" data-end="275.18">perfect example of this and it's</span> <span data-start="275.18" data-end="276.68">permeating back to all the other</span> <span data-start="276.68" data-end="285.59">browsers so fragmentation these are our</span> <span data-start="285.59" data-end="288.62">most the major mobile platforms we don't</span> <span data-start="288.62" data-end="291.23">have samsung bada in there i'm not</span> <span data-start="291.23" data-end="293.24">mentioning windows mobile because no one</span> <span data-start="293.24" data-end="296.87">cares OEM inching windows mobile maybe</span> <span data-start="296.87" data-end="303.44">the Europeans care whatever and there's</span> <span data-start="303.44" data-end="305.3">some interesting developments here if we</span> <span data-start="305.3" data-end="307.04">look at this there's there's all kinds</span> <span data-start="307.04" data-end="308.45">of different platforms but a whole bunch</span> <span data-start="308.45" data-end="310.04">of these platforms actually are already</span> <span data-start="310.04" data-end="311.9">starting to to support the web and they</span> <span data-start="311.9" data-end="315.35">hadn't previously and so there is a lot</span> <span data-start="315.35" data-end="316.91">of fragmentation there but the</span> <span data-start="316.91" data-end="319.64">fragmentation isn't necessarily existing</span> <span data-start="319.64" data-end="323.12">so much in how you write the apps but</span> <span data-start="323.12" data-end="324.83">rather the SDKs that you have to install</span> <span data-start="324.83" data-end="328.729">to to begin writing these apps there's</span> <span data-start="328.729" data-end="330.32">another aspect to this whole thing and</span> <span data-start="330.32" data-end="332.409">that's distribution of your applications</span> <span data-start="332.409" data-end="334.509">and about a year ago I started to get</span> <span data-start="334.509" data-end="336.249">really scared because there was</span> <span data-start="336.249" data-end="339.099">something like 50 app stores and now as</span> <span data-start="339.099" data-end="341.649">if today there's over 90 op stores and I</span> <span data-start="341.649" data-end="342.909">used to think this was a really bad</span> <span data-start="342.909" data-end="344.289">thing but I'm beginning to believe that</span> <span data-start="344.289" data-end="345.489">this is actually a really good thing</span> <span data-start="345.489" data-end="349.3">there's initiatives out there is anyone</span> <span data-start="349.3" data-end="351.879">here familiar with Bondi if you are</span> <span data-start="351.879" data-end="354.099">raise your hand okay have you heard</span> <span data-start="354.099" data-end="356.259">though the wac it's a really terrible</span> <span data-start="356.259" data-end="359.409">name what it stands for something like</span> <span data-start="359.409" data-end="362.589">web application warehouse or something</span> <span data-start="362.589" data-end="364.36">they're looking to standardize the idea</span> <span data-start="364.36" data-end="365.889">of an app store so that app stores could</span> <span data-start="365.889" data-end="367.239">be federated and this seems like the</span> <span data-start="367.239" data-end="368.469">right thing to do and I think it's sort</span> <span data-start="368.469" data-end="370.809">of a good idea on paper but it's never</span> <span data-start="370.809" data-end="372.579">going to fly all these people are never</span> <span data-start="372.579" data-end="373.959">going to work together and its</span> <span data-start="373.959" data-end="375.579">proliferation of app stores seems like a</span> <span data-start="375.579" data-end="377.11">really bad thing like oh no there's</span> <span data-start="377.11" data-end="378.879">going to be dozens of app stores but if</span> <span data-start="378.879" data-end="380.319">we think about how like physical goods</span> <span data-start="380.319" data-end="382.449">get transferred this isn't actually a</span> <span data-start="382.449" data-end="384.699">big departure I don't want to go to a</span> <span data-start="384.699" data-end="386.769">big box store or mall that it sells</span> <span data-start="386.769" data-end="388.989">everything and it's kind of crummy I'd</span> <span data-start="388.989" data-end="390.789">rather go to a bespoke store that</span> <span data-start="390.789" data-end="394.029">curates content or and or goods that I</span> <span data-start="394.029" data-end="395.529">expect and you could imagine things like</span> <span data-start="395.529" data-end="398.11">you could go to the EA app store by EA</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="398.11" data-end="400.569">Games and this is likely what the future</span> <span data-start="400.569" data-end="403.509">is going to hold but you know this turns</span> <span data-start="403.509" data-end="408.819">into a big distribution nightmare but</span> <span data-start="408.819" data-end="410.529">this kind of fragmentations already been</span> <span data-start="410.529" data-end="412.479">solved for years and you know it's that</span> <span data-start="412.479" data-end="413.74">whole internet thing that we've been</span> <span data-start="413.74" data-end="415.869">talking about and it turns out it's</span> <span data-start="415.869" data-end="416.8">pretty good at dealing with</span> <span data-start="416.8" data-end="420.089">fragmentation and distribution and so</span> <span data-start="420.089" data-end="422.589">once again phonegap is a way for you to</span> <span data-start="422.589" data-end="424.089">get your apps into these various app</span> <span data-start="424.089" data-end="426.729">stores but you shouldn't invest too</span> <span data-start="426.729" data-end="428.619">heavily and the idea of developing for</span> <span data-start="428.619" data-end="430.269">app stores when we have the internet to</span> <span data-start="430.269" data-end="432.849">to do this anyways so you could almost</span> <span data-start="432.849" data-end="434.289">consider phonegap as a temporary</span> <span data-start="434.289" data-end="436.449">progressive enhancement technique it's a</span> <span data-start="436.449" data-end="438.639">way to get your mobile web apps built</span> <span data-start="438.639" data-end="440.829">and in app stores while we wait for the</span> <span data-start="440.829" data-end="445.339">browsers to catch up with device api's</span> <span data-start="445.349" data-end="448.059">so that that's and another important</span> <span data-start="448.059" data-end="451.029">part about all this we've got native</span> <span data-start="451.029" data-end="454.269">device sensors and native device access</span> <span data-start="454.269" data-end="457.86">and so so what the fuck does that mean</span> <span data-start="457.86" data-end="460.149">sensors are things like your camera your</span> <span data-start="460.149" data-end="465.82">accelerometer things that that access</span> <span data-start="465.82" data-end="468.31">data and then there's device data and</span> <span data-start="468.31" data-end="471.84">thats things like photographs contacts</span> <span data-start="471.84" data-end="476.23">whatever so these are the problems that</span> <span data-start="476.23" data-end="478.57">we're looking to solve a phonegap and</span> <span data-start="478.57" data-end="479.62">we're also looking to provide a</span> <span data-start="479.62" data-end="481.93">reference implementation for install the</span> <span data-start="481.93" data-end="484.18">web apps what the hell is an installable</span> <span data-start="484.18" data-end="488.65">web app I I think like you can look at</span> <span data-start="488.65" data-end="490.93">an installable web app much like you can</span> <span data-start="490.93" data-end="494.65">look at device sensors and data it's all</span> <span data-start="494.65" data-end="497.83">it really is is an icon for the loading</span> <span data-start="497.83" data-end="500.65">screen a loading screen itself and a</span> <span data-start="500.65" data-end="502.69">permissions manifest of some kind all of</span> <span data-start="502.69" data-end="504.31">these various mobile app stores and</span> <span data-start="504.31" data-end="506.23">mobile platforms have this pattern</span> <span data-start="506.23" data-end="508.69">encapsulated somehow and interestingly</span> <span data-start="508.69" data-end="511.57">there's there's a work being done at the</span> <span data-start="511.57" data-end="513.82">w3c called the device API working group</span> <span data-start="513.82" data-end="515.349">which is tackling the idea of sensors</span> <span data-start="515.349" data-end="517.27">and data and there's the widget working</span> <span data-start="517.27" data-end="518.74">group which is tackling the idea of</span> <span data-start="518.74" data-end="520.81">installable web apps and then there's</span> <span data-start="520.81" data-end="522.61">things like the Chrome Web App Store</span> <span data-start="522.61" data-end="525.7">that are coming so so these concepts are</span> <span data-start="525.7" data-end="527.62">already out there and being worked on</span> <span data-start="527.62" data-end="531.94">phonegap is is just another one yeah I</span> <span data-start="531.94" data-end="533.47">have no idea what that slide has to do</span> <span data-start="533.47" data-end="538.54">with anything okay so current platform</span> <span data-start="538.54" data-end="540.61">support is that the next big question</span> <span data-start="540.61" data-end="541.87">people have like what are you guys</span> <span data-start="541.87" data-end="545.73">working on and what are you doing and so</span> <span data-start="545.73" data-end="548.41">before I like talk specifically to what</span> <span data-start="548.41" data-end="550.18">platforms that we're supporting it I</span> <span data-start="550.18" data-end="552.01">have to talk to about how we plan to</span> <span data-start="552.01" data-end="554.86">support it and you don't want to start</span> <span data-start="554.86" data-end="557.08">building this big monolithic system when</span> <span data-start="557.08" data-end="558.79">you're dealing with devices that have</span> <span data-start="558.79" data-end="560.53">the computational power of something</span> <span data-start="560.53" data-end="561.91">from the 90s like these things are</span> <span data-start="561.91" data-end="565.6">pretty crummy computers and so phonegap</span> <span data-start="565.6" data-end="566.98">itself has to have the smallest</span> <span data-start="566.98" data-end="569.92">footprint possible we can't touch we</span> <span data-start="569.92" data-end="571.63">have to touch as little as possible so</span> <span data-start="571.63" data-end="574.27">that we remain performant another rule</span> <span data-start="574.27" data-end="575.71">that we have to play by is that we have</span> <span data-start="575.71" data-end="578.11">to use the native SDK it would be nice</span> <span data-start="578.11" data-end="580.18">if we could write our own browser but</span> <span data-start="580.18"

data-end="603.28">themselves phonegap should remain</span> <span data-start="603.28" data-end="605.59">accessible and the idea here is that you</span> <span data-start="605.59" data-end="607.24">can install your own stuff and keep</span> <span data-start="607.24" data-end="610.93">working so sometimes people get confused</span> <span data-start="610.93" data-end="613.3">and they think oh phonegap is for</span> <span data-start="613.3" data-end="615.13">building web apps therefore it has no</span> <span data-start="615.13" data-end="616.6">native accidents but this is an</span> <span data-start="616.6" data-end="618.79">incorrect assertion phonegap is a</span> <span data-start="618.79" data-end="621.37">starting point for writing web apps that</span> <span data-start="621.37" data-end="624.16">allows you to write native extensions</span> <span data-start="624.16" data-end="626.23">yourself so there's no reason that you</span> <span data-start="626.23" data-end="628.36">can't have native code we just think</span> <span data-start="628.36" data-end="630.64">it's a bad idea if you can avoid it you</span> <span data-start="630.64" data-end="632.8">should because it's not cross platform</span> <span data-start="632.8" data-end="634.24">and then you'll have to implement it six</span> <span data-start="634.24" data-end="635.5">times if you want to hit multiple</span> <span data-start="635.5" data-end="638.65">devices that said there is times when</span> <span data-start="638.65" data-end="640.81">you should

<p><span data-start="686.65" data-end="690.27">Android or in iphone land in webos</span> <span data-start="690.27" data-end="692.62">things are even more interesting there's</span> <span

data-end="704.29">this isn't necessarily native UI but it</span> <span data-start="704.29" data-end="705.91">is a native feature and when you're</span> <span data-start="705.91"
