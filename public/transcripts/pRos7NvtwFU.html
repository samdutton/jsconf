data-end="219.65">interesting challenges in terms of</span> <span data-start="219.65" data-end="224.48">scaling to different regions and then</span> <span data-start="224.48"

data-end="231.019">so that do you see kind of losses or a</span> <span data-start="231.019" data-end="232.579">night air and things and then there's</span> <span data-start="232.579" data-end="234.709">this kind of really high target to kind</span> <span data-start="234.709" data-end="236.599">of get some chance empty million like</span> <span data-start="236.599"

data-end="244.34">numbers kind of difficult to kind of put</span> <span data-start="244.34" data-end="246.29">them into context so that's going to be</span> <span data-start="246.29" data-end="249.409">enough of this just the big statistics</span> <span data-start="249.409" data-end="251.629">really and I'm just going to like just</span> <span data-start="251.629" data-end="253.549">all that down to like what what that</span> <span data-start="253.549" data-end="255.65">intro review about so lots of users lots</span> <span data-start="255.65" data-end="257.84">of pages what we really care about is</span> <span data-start="257.84" data-end="259.88">like reusing things so as you can</span> <span data-start="259.88" data-end="261.5">imagine like having lots of their sites</span> <span data-start="261.5" data-end="263.949">it's like it doesn't make sense to</span> <span data-start="263.949" data-end="267.02">rebuild everything for for all of those</span> <span data-start="267.02" data-end="268.49">things it will be like a maintenance</span> <span data-start="268.49" data-end="269.539">nightmare</span> <span data-start="269.539" data-end="272.93">so as much of a reusability that we can</span> <span data-start="272.93" data-end="276.289">get in our systems are better and want</span> <span data-start="276.289" data-end="279.349">our sites be localizable which is so to</span> <span data-start="279.349" data-end="282.83">be able to just change the script some</span> <span data-start="282.83" data-end="284.539">languages and things and to make them</span> <span data-start="284.539" data-end="287.87">lightweight so especially for some of</span> <span data-start="287.87"

<p><span data-start="463.54" data-end="465.58">I found it pretty difficult when</span> <span data-start="465.58" data-end="467.59">starting out understand like these</span> <span data-start="467.59" data-end="472.51">abstract concepts and things so instead</span> <span data-start="472.51" data-end="474.04">of just kind of going through the</span> <span data-start="474.04" data-end="475.9">one-by-one and just talking about the</span> <span data-start="475.9" data-end="477.13">theory behind it all</span> <span data-start="477.13" data-end="479.4">I thought I'd start off with examples</span> <span data-start="479.4" data-end="481.5">because I find it much easier to</span> <span data-start="481.5" data-end="485.2">understand things for examples alright</span> <span data-start="485.2" data-end="487.54">so as you surfaces like the front pages</span> <span data-start="487.54" data-end="490.06">we've seen years on some desk looks like</span> <span data-start="490.06" data-end="492.04">a bit more of an industry breeze that</span> <span data-start="492.04" data-end="494.26">will be a lot of people do that set</span> <span data-start="494.26" data-end="495.03">films</span> <span data-start="495.03" data-end="499.33">remember so let's actually look at three</span> <span data-start="499.33" data-end="501.55">different parts of the of the page</span> <span data-start="501.55" data-end="504.22">layout and this will three things up</span> <span data-start="504.22" data-end="507.61">close so the first one is like a live</span> <span data-start="507.61" data-end="510.25">poll so actually on that website it does</span> <span data-start="510.25" data-end="513.4">also it's got CSS animations the second</span> <span data-start="513.4" data-end="515.589">one is the timestamp soul or clock icon</span> <span data-start="515.589" data-end="518.229">with like how long text saying how long</span> <span data-start="518.229" data-end="521.76">ago the story replaced last updated and</span> <span data-start="521.76" data-end="525.12">finally like a media icon like media</span> <span data-start="525.12" data-end="530.44">play video icon with the heading so okay</span> <span data-start="530.44" data-end="531.76">you might look at these and think all</span> <span data-start="531.76" data-end="533.53">right so these are actually very</span> <span data-start="533.53" data-end="535.36">different like the different colors this</span> <span data-start="535.36" data-end="537.43">like a different like and typography</span> <span data-start="537.43" data-end="540.01">that the sponsor like the different</span> <span data-start="540.01" data-end="541.68">iPhones do like there's nothing really</span> <span data-start="541.68" data-end="544.839">similar with this but actually if you</span> <span data-start="544.839" data-end="546.49">look kind of a bit closer you can</span> <span data-start="546.49" data-end="547.81">actually see that under the hood</span> <span data-start="547.81" data-end="552.43">counseling and there are similarities</span> <span data-start="552.43" data-end="557.26">here so for example you'll see that</span> <span data-start="557.26" data-end="561.94">there is the text and to the left of</span> <span data-start="561.94" data-end="563.74">that there is an icon which is exactly</span> <span data-start="563.74" data-end="565.58">the same height as the text</span> <span data-start="565.58" data-end="568.19">in which some of that and it fit the</span> <span data-start="568.19" data-end="570.29">spacing between them right so that's a</span> <span data-start="570.29" data-end="571.93">very similar hand so that's like</span> <span data-start="571.93" data-end="573.83">different components because ever</span> <span data-start="573.83" data-end="575.899">they're not nests they're not identical</span> <span data-start="575.899" data-end="577.49">you know different styling some things</span> <span data-start="577.49" data-end="581.3">but other hoods those have a similar</span> <span data-start="581.3" data-end="584.209">base pattern so we can actually use that</span> <span data-start="584.209" data-end="586.31">we can actually extract that out it's</span> <span data-start="586.31" data-end="588.62">like a bullet patterns school a bullet</span> <span data-start="588.62" data-end="590.69">pattern because like Phillip points</span> <span data-start="590.69" data-end="592.399">something so it kind of reminds you of</span> <span data-start="592.399" data-end="594.29">like kinda web came up some bullet</span> <span data-start="594.29" data-end="596.05">points and all that kind of thing so</span> <span data-start="596.05" data-end="599.779">yeah so what was this pattern a block of</span> <span data-start="599.779" data-end="601.94">text icon with the same height of it and</span> <span data-start="601.94" data-end="604.67">space et and I'm so pretty pretty simple</span> <span data-start="604.67" data-end="607.16">but it's been used in multiple places so</span> <span data-start="607.16"
