data-end="727.92">do we empower multi feature development</span> <span data-start="727.92" data-end="730.45">by multiple developers at the same time</span> <span data-start="730.45" data-end="732.61">and the answer released for us at least</span> <span data-start="732.61" data-end="735.61">it starts with get flow and most of you</span> <span data-start="735.61" data-end="737.44">know I mean you probably know what gate</span> <span data-start="737.44" data-end="741.5">flow is and again like bear with me okay</span> <span data-start="741.51" data-end="743.8">and for the for the sake of those who</span> <span data-start="743.8" data-end="745.93">don't I just want to do a quick repack</span> <span data-start="745.93" data-end="749.08">recap and give that get flow is</span> <span data-start="749.08" data-end="751.57">basically a branching model it's a</span> <span data-start="751.57" data-end="753.1">convention that everybody and your team</span> <span data-start="753.1" data-end="757.21">will adopt and just helps to ensure same</span> <span data-start="757.21" data-end="761.77">branching state for our purposes the</span> <span data-start="761.77" data-end="763.96">fundamental block is really the feature</span> <span data-start="763.96" data-end="766.45">branches feature branches are basically</span> <span data-start="766.45" data-end="768.76">where you write all your code it's based</span> <span data-start="768.76" data-end="771.82">off the developed branch you work on</span> <span data-start="771.82" data-end="776.44">this every single day for example in the</span> <span data-start="776.44" data-end="779.11">feature 4gs conf you would do a feature</span> <span data-start="779.11" data-end="783.07">flow get flow features comp and what</span> <span data-start="783.07" data-end="784.81">this does is just basically takes</span> <span data-start="784.81" data-end="786.82">develop and creates a new branch and</span> <span data-start="786.82" data-end="790.24">checks it out automatically for you once</span> <span data-start="790.24" data-end="791.29">you're done with the feature you</span> <span data-start="791.29" data-end="793.06">basically merge it back in to develop</span> <span data-start="793.06" data-end="795.13">and that's why the develop branch is the</span> <span data-start="795.13" data-end="797.41">integration branch it's where all your</span> <span data-start="797.41" data-end="799.21">features get much into ones they've</span> <span data-start="799.21" data-end="803.29">finished like for example when you</span> <span data-start="803.29" data-end="805.45">finish off the GS con feature you just</span> <span data-start="805.45" data-end="807.37">do a feature floor finish and what this</span> <span data-start="807.37" data-end="807.92">does</span> <span data-start="807.92" data-end="810.74">it checks out develop it merges GS count</span> <span data-start="810.74" data-end="812.36">back in to develop and deletes this</span> <span data-start="812.36" data-end="816.62">feature branch release branch there's</span> <span data-start="816.62" data-end="818.69">another one where you want where you</span> <span data-start="818.69" data-end="821.089">want to combine a set of features this</span> <span data-start="821.089" data-end="823.25">is particularly useful has been useful</span> <span data-start="823.25" data-end="826.25">for us when you want to stage completed</span> <span data-start="826.25" data-end="829.42">features that you want to deploy later</span> <span data-start="829.42" data-end="831.709">like for example you worked on feature</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="831.709" data-end="834.44">ABC you're done you're integrated it</span> <span data-start="834.44" data-end="836.389">you've integrated into a develop branch</span> <span data-start="836.389" data-end="837.68">and then you want to release it a week</span> <span data-start="837.68" data-end="839.54">later but at the same time you're going</span> <span data-start="839.54" data-end="843.589">to start on D and E at that point it's</span> <span data-start="843.589" data-end="845.449">probably good to get developed merged</span> <span data-start="845.449" data-end="848.839">into release and then not touch it until</span> <span data-start="848.839" data-end="853.22">it's actually out in production and of</span> <span data-start="853.22" data-end="854.48">course you can probably guess at this</span> <span data-start="854.48" data-end="856.07">point that you know master branch it</span> <span data-start="856.07" data-end="857.86">contains the official release history</span> <span data-start="857.86" data-end="860.23">anything that is in master branches</span> <span data-start="860.23" data-end="863.779">production and in case of like you know</span> <span data-start="863.779" data-end="865.279">when really hits the fence you have</span> <span data-start="865.279" data-end="867.11">hotfix branches which are pretty much</span> <span data-start="867.11" data-end="869.87">similar to feature branches but they're</span> <span data-start="869.87" data-end="872">based off the master branch instead of</span> <span data-start="872" data-end="876.47">the develop branch so really get flow</span> <span data-start="876.47" data-end="879.05">helps maintain the sanity of our</span> <span data-start="879.05" data-end="881.899">branches for us and from what I went</span> <span data-start="881.899" data-end="882.98">through just now you'll notice that</span> <span data-start="882.98" data-end="885.079">there's like three branches which are</span> <span data-start="885.079" data-end="887.75">kind of like gatekeepers so like develop</span> <span data-start="887.75" data-end="889.64">release and master and it makes kind of</span> <span data-start="889.64" data-end="892.49">like a common sense decision in terms of</span> <span data-start="892.49" data-end="896.36">code review that we do it there so</span> <span data-start="896.36" data-end="899.089">anytime you want to put code in to</span> <span data-start="899.089" data-end="901.459">develop release or master it has to go</span> <span data-start="901.459" data-end="903.23">through like a pull request and a proper</span> <span data-start="903.23" data-end="906.079">code review process kind of like the</span> <span data-start="906.079" data-end="911">pseudo one that we did just now so get</span> <span data-start="911" data-end="914.42">flow helps but for us of oats help as</span> <span data-start="914.42" data-end="917.589">well we specifically has this have these</span> <span data-start="917.589" data-end="920.69">commit and feature branch only commit</span> <span data-start="920.69" data-end="923.3">and push often in fact like we we make</span> <span data-start="923.3" data-end="924.74">it a point that every single logical</span> <span data-start="924.74" data-end="927.139">improvement to the code is committed and</span> <span data-start="927.139" data-end="930.769">pushed we also merge develop into</span> <span data-start="930.769" data-end="932.69">feature branches every day just because</span> <span data-start="932.69" data-end="934.579">somebody else would be working on other</span> <span data-start="934.579" data-end="936.319">features and they may have merged alien</span> <span data-start="936.319" data-end="939.86">to develop and merge features only in</span> <span data-start="939.86" data-end="940.68">the developed never</span> <span data-start="940.68" data-end="942.72">ever ever do master only have pull</span> <span data-start="942.72" data-end="946.11">requests to master and as long as we use</span> <span data-start="946.11" data-end="948.839">get flow and stick to our odds we are</span> <span data-start="948.839" data-end="951.48">really able to work on really as many</span> <span data-start="951.48" data-end="954.06">features that we want at least at this</span> <span data-start="954.06" data-end="957.149">point but obviously just having</span> <span data-start="957.149" data-end="959.79">branching is really not enough we still</span> <span data-start="959.79" data-end="962.82">have if just just by having branches we</span> <span data-start="962.82" data-end="963.87">still have to bring our laptops</span> <span data-start="963.87" data-end="965.7">everywhere we need to get we actually</span> <span data-start="965.7" data-end="967.35">now need to get them deployed and to</span> <span data-start="967.35" data-end="969.57">that I want to talk a little bit about</span> <span data-start="969.57" data-end="972.11">our environments of which we have four</span> <span data-start="972.11" data-end="974.79">and again you'll see how like get flow</span> <span data-start="974.79" data-end="977.06">is really the starting point for our</span> <span data-start="977.06" data-end="979.589">environments as well the first one is</span> <span data-start="979.589" data-end="981.06">local I mean this is really</span> <span data-start="981.06" data-end="982.95">straightforward it's the developers</span> <span data-start="982.95" data-end="986.58">laptop yeah done we jump to the third</span> <span data-start="986.58" data-end="988.8">one I'll get back to the second but this</span> <span data-start="988.8" data-end="992.13">is basically this hosts the staging</span> <span data-start="992.13" data-end="994.2">arrahman hosts basically the developed</span> <span data-start="994.2" data-end="996.12">branch or the release branch and the</span> <span data-start="996.12" data-end="997.62">reason why it could be both is because</span> <span data-start="997.62" data-end="999.57">we may not have a release branch all the</span> <span data-start="999.57" data-end="1002.12">time if we do then it serves the release</span> <span data-start="1002.12" data-end="1003.709">branch otherwise it always serves the</span> <span data-start="1003.709" data-end="1006.89">develop branch and obviously we have the</span> <span data-start="1006.89" data-end="1008.709">production environment which you run</span> <span data-start="1008.709" data-end="1011.6">which runs everything that's in the</span> <span data-start="1011.6" data-end="1012.92">master branch everything that's in</span> <span data-start="1012.92" data-end="1014.35">master branch goes into production and</span> <span data-start="1014.35" data-end="1017.24">you think actually that this is probably</span> <span data-start="1017.24" data-end="1021.32">the most important branch but to us the</span> <span data-start="1021.32" data-end="1023.15">development branch is actually the most</span> <span data-start="1023.15" data-end="1026.059">important it's where the features are</span> <span data-start="1026.059" data-end="1028.16">deploy it's where the real stuff happens</span> <span data-start="1028.16" data-end="1034.51">and we and we invest in that so</span> <span data-start="1034.51" data-end="1036.86">basically when you deploy something to a</span> <span data-start="1036.86" data-end="1038.569">develop branch it automatically goes to</span> <span data-start="1038.569" data-end="1041.54">alpha no red mercom if you deploy</span> <span data-start="1041.54" data-end="1042.949">something to a feature branch it</span> <span data-start="1042.949" data-end="1045.589">automatically goes to a feature URL</span> <span data-start="1045.589" data-end="1047.66">something like this which would which is</span> <span data-start="1047.66" data-end="1049.55">what we saw just now when I did a push I</span> <span data-start="1049.55" data-end="1053.87">was deployed although I cheated but it's</span> <span data-start="1053.87" data-end="1056.809">still deployed at GS conf alpha to read</span> <span data-start="1056.809" data-end="1058.82">more calm so anybody can go in and</span> <span data-start="1058.82" data-end="1062.33">access it and provide feedback and the</span> <span data-start="1062.33" data-end="1064.73">commander deploy basically is is the</span> <span data-start="1064.73" data-end="1069.14">ever so loved git push right it just</span> <span data-start="1069.14" data-end="1070.52">figures out like depending on which</span> <span data-start="1070.52" data-end="1072.86">branch you deploy to which branch you</span> <span data-start="1072.86" data-end="1073.81">push it</span> <span data-start="1073.81" data-end="1076.57">it gets deployed by CI automatically so</span> <span data-start="1076.57" data-end="1077.77">you really don't have to worry about</span> <span data-start="1077.77" data-end="1079.42">anything else but just working about</span> <span data-start="1079.42" data-end="1082.96">your code and working in Game four the</span>
