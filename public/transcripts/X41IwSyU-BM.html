data-end="1102.169">music at least in the drum section and</span> <span data-start="1102.169" data-end="1104">so this is a very simple drum pattern</span> <span data-start="1104" data-end="1107.299">and the characteristics of this is that</span> <span data-start="1107.299" data-end="1109.669">you have slots in time we can attach</span> <span data-start="1109.669" data-end="1111.529">events to and usually the events is</span> <span data-start="1111.529" data-end="1114.139">trigger a sample or trigger a note or</span> <span data-start="1114.139" data-end="1117.5">something and so this is one thing you</span> <span data-start="1117.5" data-end="1119.75">you have to do when you want to build a</span> <span data-start="1119.75" data-end="1121.34">system like this you have to have a</span> <span data-start="1121.34" data-end="1123.379">possibilities to schedule events at</span> <span data-start="1123.379" data-end="1125.96">certain times and the Web Audio API is</span> <span data-start="1125.96" data-end="1127.94">pretty good at that so that's that's</span> <span data-start="1127.94" data-end="1128.659">kind of cool</span> <span data-start="1128.659" data-end="1132.74">now usually music can be a lot more</span> <span data-start="1132.74" data-end="1136.1">interesting than that by varying things</span> <span data-start="1136.1" data-end="1139.009">in between and you know this could this</span> <span data-start="1139.009" data-end="1140.779">could be everything you know this this</span> <span data-start="1140.779" data-end="1145.46">is a not a sine wave this is something I</span> <span data-start="1145.46" data-end="1148.97">came up with last late night I guess so</span> <span data-start="1148.97" data-end="1151.309">it's it's a modulation of some kind of</span> <span data-start="1151.309" data-end="1152.72">parameter it could be a filter frequency</span> <span data-start="1152.72" data-end="1155.419">it could be the frequency of a note or</span> <span data-start="1155.419" data-end="1160.1">something but the the the most important</span> <span data-start="1160.1" data-end="1162.379">part here is that you want to vary</span> <span data-start="1162.379" data-end="1164.269">things over the boundaries of these</span> <span data-start="1164.269" data-end="1166.94">pattern slots so they need there needs</span> <span data-start="1166.94" data-end="1169.879">to be a way to schedule not only events</span> <span data-start="1169.879" data-end="1172.73">at certain times but also changes over</span> <span data-start="1172.73" data-end="1176.36">time and luckily the Web Audio API has</span> <span data-start="1176.36" data-end="1179.87">have it has covered so this is my very</span> <span data-start="1179.87" data-end="1184.36">scientific diagram of how stuff in the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1184.36" data-end="1187.429">Web Audio API works and I've now</span> <span data-start="1187.429" data-end="1189.919">realized that probably you can't read</span> <span data-start="1189.919" data-end="1191.69">the names of the methods I wrote down</span> <span data-start="1191.69" data-end="1199.1">there too bad so if you how many of you</span> <span data-start="1199.1" data-end="1201.08">have seen the tour from yon at bluejack</span> <span data-start="1201.08" data-end="1202.07">jeaious</span> <span data-start="1202.07" data-end="1208.1">on Thursday so a few so there there is</span> <span data-start="1208.1" data-end="1212.33">this idea that the the audio context</span> <span data-start="1212.33" data-end="1214.37">which is the the basic object from which</span> <span data-start="1214.37" data-end="1216.95">you construct all the objects in the Web</span> <span data-start="1216.95" data-end="1219.92">Audio API has this idea of its own time</span> <span data-start="1219.92" data-end="1223.1">context and you can always ask it what</span> <span data-start="1223.1" data-end="1223.76">time it is</span> <span data-start="1223.76" data-end="1225.53">that's pretty kind of good what time is</span> <span data-start="1225.53" data-end="1229.31">is its I don't know 5 SEC's then 5</span> <span data-start="1229.31" data-end="1232.46">seconds and 50 milliseconds since I've</span> <span data-start="1232.46" data-end="1234.83">been started and this is current time so</span> <span data-start="1234.83" data-end="1236.51">it's an attribute you can just read out</span> <span data-start="1236.51" data-end="1238.52">and it gives you the current time now</span> <span data-start="1238.52" data-end="1240.35">with this you can actually start</span> <span data-start="1240.35" data-end="1242.09">scheduling things in the future because</span> <span data-start="1242.09" data-end="1244.43">now you know ok this is now and I want</span> <span data-start="1244.43" data-end="1246.08">to start something in 2 seconds and I</span> <span data-start="1246.08" data-end="1247.46">just take current time and add two</span> <span data-start="1247.46" data-end="1249.7">seconds to it and it's floating-point</span> <span data-start="1249.7" data-end="1254.06">mathematics so in theory it should get</span> <span data-start="1254.06" data-end="1256.07">really really imprecise after a long</span> <span data-start="1256.07" data-end="1260.06">time and I've seen box on browser bark</span> <span data-start="1260.06" data-end="1262.1">trackers that actually try to deal with</span> <span data-start="1262.1" data-end="1263.99">this because it's kind of hairy so if</span> <span data-start="1263.99" data-end="1265.91">you let it run for two hours and it get</span> <span data-start="1265.91" data-end="1270.83">gets off by more than 20 milliseconds or</span> <span data-start="1270.83" data-end="1273.08">so the beat starts to crumble and that's</span> <span data-start="1273.08" data-end="1277.58">not good and now if you want to start a</span> <span data-start="1277.58" data-end="1279.89">sound and stop a sound you can do so by</span> <span data-start="1279.89" data-end="1282.05">just saying okay current time plus X and</span> <span data-start="1282.05" data-end="1284.96">that's the top one so you have a start</span> <span data-start="1284.96" data-end="1287.51">and a stop event now if you want to</span> <span data-start="1287.51" data-end="1289.73">change parameters most of the parameters</span> <span data-start="1289.73" data-end="1292.34">in the Web Audio API as what what's</span> <span data-start="1292.34" data-end="1296.21">called an audio param element audio</span> <span data-start="1296.21" data-end="1298.1">param class which is kind of cool</span> <span data-start="1298.1" data-end="1300.29">because it allows you to schedule not</span> <span data-start="1300.29" data-end="1303.14">only events but also changes into the</span> <span data-start="1303.14" data-end="1306.59">future and so there is if you say dot</span> <span data-start="1306.59" data-end="1308.33">value you've probably seen me typing</span> <span data-start="1308.33" data-end="1311.21">that once it just sets the value</span> <span data-start="1311.21" data-end="1314.6">immediately if you say set value at time</span> <span data-start="1314.6" data-end="1318.8">that's a that's a method call then you</span> <span data-start="1318.8" data-end="1320.96">can say okay I want this value to be X</span> <span data-start="1320.96" data-end="1327.92">at time Z Y and that's the and it the</span> <span data-start="1327.92" data-end="1330.38">the idea is that it changes the value in</span> <span data-start="1330.38" data-end="1332.75">a way that the audio doesn't click so it</span> <span data-start="1332.75" data-end="1335.15">will not change it immediately like from</span> <span data-start="1335.15" data-end="1335.57">one</span> <span data-start="1335.57" data-end="1338.15">to 0 but from 1 to 0 in like a few</span> <span data-start="1338.15" data-end="1339.98">milliseconds and that's kind of nice</span> <span data-start="1339.98" data-end="1341.51">because you don't have to worry about</span> <span data-start="1341.51" data-end="1345.92">that and then you have also the</span> <span data-start="1345.92" data-end="1347.69">possibility to say okay I want this</span> <span data-start="1347.69" data-end="1350.21">value to gradually change over time and</span> <span data-start="1350.21" data-end="1352.79">there are linear changes so linear ramp</span> <span data-start="1352.79" data-end="1355.54">to value at time that's a pretty great</span> <span data-start="1355.54" data-end="1358.99">method name if you ask me and</span> <span data-start="1358.99" data-end="1361.37">exponential ramp to value at time and</span> <span data-start="1361.37" data-end="1362.93">then there are a few others that allow</span> <span data-start="1362.93" data-end="1365.99">you to to Eve be even more creative with</span> <span data-start="1365.99" data-end="1368.63">these things and the exponential one is</span> <span data-start="1368.63" data-end="1370.67">extremely interesting because in music</span> <span data-start="1370.67" data-end="1373.4">you always you often deal with values</span> <span data-start="1373.4" data-end="1375.26">like frequencies or so where it makes a</span> <span data-start="1375.26" data-end="1376.97">lot of sense to not linearly interpolate</span> <span data-start="1376.97" data-end="1380.63">but do it exponentially so that's kind</span> <span data-start="1380.63" data-end="1388.19">of very cool to have and with this you</span> <span data-start="1388.19" data-end="1391.76">can actually do best of both worlds so</span> <span data-start="1391.76" data-end="1395.3">you can schedule events on precise</span> <span data-start="1395.3" data-end="1397.04">timings and then change values over time</span> <span data-start="1397.04" data-end="1399.62">and everything you've heard like the</span> <span data-start="1399.62" data-end="1402.5">small filter phase at the start of a</span> <span data-start="1402.5" data-end="1404.45">note that is basically me scheduling</span> <span data-start="1404.45" data-end="1406.88">filter changes over time and that's all</span> <span data-start="1406.88" data-end="1408.74">happening in my abstractions and and</span> <span data-start="1408.74" data-end="1411.26">they are quite easy to handle now</span> <span data-start="1411.26" data-end="1416.78">there's a problem if you want to</span> <span data-start="1416.78" data-end="1418.85">actually make music and change</span> <span data-start="1418.85" data-end="1422.18">parameters over time in real time let's</span> <span data-start="1422.18" data-end="1423.98">say you have this controller and you</span> <span data-start="1423.98" data-end="1426.35">want to change things with knobs then</span> <span data-start="1426.35" data-end="1428.27">you suddenly have a problem of well I've</span> <span data-start="1428.27" data-end="1430.37">just I can schedule things in the future</span> <span data-start="1430.37" data-end="1432.01">but what do I do with these button</span> <span data-start="1432.01" data-end="1435.95">thingies here and or with with knobs or</span> <span data-start="1435.95" data-end="1438.26">with sliders or whatever and it that's</span> <span data-start="1438.26" data-end="1440.45">actually a problem that is not very easy</span> <span data-start="1440.45" data-end="1443.42">to solve for reasons that are quite</span> <span data-start="1443.42" data-end="1449.05">complex trying to explain them anyway so</span> <span data-start="1449.05" data-end="1451.64">there are basically two categories of</span> <span data-start="1451.64" data-end="1455.21">categories of notes in the Web Audio API</span> <span data-start="1455.21" data-end="1459.16">one is the generator part which are</span> <span data-start="1459.16" data-end="1461.87">disposable so you start the sound you</span> <span data-start="1461.87" data-end="1463.76">stop a sound and the object is basically</span> <span data-start="1463.76" data-end="1466.7">gone or can be can be thrown away</span> <span data-start="1466.7" data-end="1468.5">because it cannot start it again it's</span> <span data-start="1468.5" data-end="1469.34">not it's not</span> <span data-start="1469.34" data-end="1471.95">usable and the problem with that is if I</span> <span data-start="1471.95" data-end="1474.14">want to attach a value in real time to</span> <span data-start="1474.14" data-end="1475.97">it I have to reattach it every time I</span> <span data-start="1475.97" data-end="1477.71">create a new object and this can be</span> <span data-start="1477.71" data-end="1481.49">quite complicated and then there's this</span> <span data-start="1481.49" data-end="1484.49">other category like filters or effects</span> <span data-start="1484.49" data-end="1486.65">that can actually exist for a very long</span> <span data-start="1486.65" data-end="1488.57">time and there it's not so much of a</span> <span data-start="1488.57" data-end="1490.07">problem because you have that one object</span> <span data-start="1490.07" data-end="1493.88">you can talk to at all time and I really</span> <span data-start="1493.88" data-end="1498.64">didn't solve this problem very good</span> <span data-start="1498.64" data-end="1502.04">so I to show you that it's it's</span> <span data-start="1502.04" data-end="1504.2">basically possible to do that I have a</span> <span data-start="1504.2" data-end="1508.97">last example that will hopefully show a</span> <span data-start="1508.97" data-end="1513.71">few of these things better so again I</span> <span data-start="1513.71" data-end="1516.05">don't start from scratch because I don't</span> <span data-start="1516.05" data-end="1522.59">want to bore you to for too long here so</span> <span data-start="1522.59" data-end="1536.52">you've heard that before</span> <span data-start="1536.53" data-end="1542.63">and the clap snare you're hearing there</span> <span data-start="1542.63" data-end="1546.77">is actually playing through a reverb</span> <span data-start="1546.77" data-end="1553.01">filter and this this filter has a an</span> <span data-start="1553.01" data-end="1556.97">attribute called mix and I I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1556.97" data-end="1560.72">try and attach something to it and I</span> <span data-start="1560.72" data-end="1572.54">hope this works</span> <span data-start="1572.55" data-end="1577.33">so this is a leap motion and there's</span> <span data-start="1577.33" data-end="1579.1">this javascript library that allows you</span> <span data-start="1579.1" data-end="1581.65">to do leap motion stuff in the browser</span> <span data-start="1581.65" data-end="1584.53">and I've just attached it so this this</span> <span data-start="1584.53" data-end="1586.21">method looks quite complicated but</span> <span data-start="1586.21" data-end="1587.89">that's just because I have to kind of</span> <span data-start="1587.89" data-end="1590.44">reverse the object graph of this frame</span> <span data-start="1590.44" data-end="1593.29">that comes from the sensor and I need to</span> <span data-start="1593.29" data-end="1595.21">do it in a way that doesn't crash if the</span> <span data-start="1595.21" data-end="1597.94">object is actually not there so that's</span> <span data-start="1597.94" data-end="1608.71">the best thing I came up with now let's</span> <span data-start="1608.71" data-end="1781.28">turn it into music</span> <span data-start="1781.29" data-end="1797.1">thank you very much</span> </p>
