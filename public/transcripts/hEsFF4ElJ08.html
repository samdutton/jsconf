<p><span data-start="8.364" data-end="9.1">Can you hear me?</span> <span data-start="11.271" data-end="12.202">Let's get started.</span> <span data-start="13.026" data-end="16.947">My name is Ahn Jae Man, and in this session</span> <span data-start="16.948" data-end="20.867">I am going to give a presentation about the Life-saving AI and Javascript.</span> <span data-start="21.033" data-end="21.7">Nice to meet you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.117" data-end="30.8">I work at AITRICS, a medical AI corporation, and I use AI</span> <span data-start="30.801" data-end="35.5">to predict the acute and critical diseases and emergencies of the inpatients,</span> <span data-start="35.868" data-end="38.171">And report the results to the medical team and help them to prepare for such incidents</span> <span data-start="38.611" data-end="40">We are provide solutions for such events.</span> <span data-start="40.832" data-end="47.399">Today I am here to walk you through the process and issues during the development of such solutions.</span> <span data-start="48.428" data-end="51.3">The topic itself is very broad.</span> <span data-start="51.301" data-end="54.131">When we say medical technology, it's a very broad term, same applies for the AI.</span> <span data-start="54.241" data-end="55.667">Likewise, there's a lot to talk about Javascript.</span> <span data-start="56.079" data-end="59.881">Our topics are extensive, and since I have such a limited time of 30 minutes,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="60.494" data-end="63.289">I might briefly touch on some subjects on the surface level</span> <span data-start="63.29" data-end="65.999">On some topics, I may lack depth in my explanation.</span> <span data-start="66" data-end="69.132">and it might be hard to understand.</span> <span data-start="69.598" data-end="72.6">I apologize for such circumstances.</span> <span data-start="73.556" data-end="75.576">If you want further information</span> <span data-start="75.577" data-end="80.999">or if you would like to discuss some issues in depth, you can ask me,</span> <span data-start="81" data-end="84.816">or you can come talk to me in person later after the presentation,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="85.146" data-end="88.546">I'll gladly discuss with you later on.</span> <span data-start="90.823" data-end="94.899">So in this session, what I would like to talk about is</span> <span data-start="94.9" data-end="99.132">The field of medical AI is not familiar with most people.</span> <span data-start="99.133" data-end="102.575">A lot of you might have heard of artificial intelligence so you'll might already be familiar with that.</span> <span data-start="102.943" data-end="106.452">but medical AI would be something most of you haven't heard of. So I will introduce you about this first</span> <span data-start="107.325" data-end="110.939">and then I will go over how to develop AI solutions,</span> <span data-start="111.307" data-end="113.719">the process of such development.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="114.351" data-end="120.128">And then related to this topic, we are using the JS, so I will talk about Javascript related techniques</span> <span data-start="120.129" data-end="124.441">We use a lot of languages like Javascript, Python, and Go,</span> <span data-start="124.744" data-end="128.857">Today I would like to focus on the Javascript related issues.</span> <span data-start="129.515" data-end="134.122">And because the AI is different from regular softwares,</span> <span data-start="134.123" data-end="137.796">I will discuss several issues in relation to that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="139.717" data-end="143">This is the contents for today, and now I will start my presentation.</span> <span data-start="145.174" data-end="147.6">I will introduce the medical AI.</span> <span data-start="150.521" data-end="155.974">What if your code could save someone's life?</span> <span data-start="158.843" data-end="160.666">What if the code you created</span> <span data-start="161.435" data-end="164.889">Can contribute to raising the survival rate, even just 1%,</span> <span data-start="165.411" data-end="168.537">Your code will be able to save the life of one person out of a hundred.</span> <span data-start="171.548" data-end="176.092">In the U.S., 250,000 people lose their lives annually because of medical malpractice.</span> <span data-start="176.901" data-end="180.165">Now if your code may contribute to reducing such malpractice,</span> <span data-start="180.686" data-end="182.5">and increase the survival rate, even if it's just one percent,</span> <span data-start="183.099" data-end="186.6">You will be able to save 2,500 people annually, out of the 250,000.</span> <span data-start="190.256" data-end="192.1">Isn't it fascinating?</span> <span data-start="192.101" data-end="196.453">Now, I will talk about how the software engineering</span> <span data-start="196.782" data-end="199.058">and AI can save people's lives,</span> <span data-start="201.606" data-end="205.612">So one of the solutions we are working on right now is this:</span> <span data-start="205.804" data-end="210.74">This is a solution that predicts acute diseases in advance</span> <span data-start="210.741" data-end="212.8">and report the results to the doctors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="213.154" data-end="216.279">So what are the acute diseases and emergencies?</span> <span data-start="216.28" data-end="217.9">It can be death itself,</span> <span data-start="218.227" data-end="220.996">and an unexpected cardiac arrest,</span> <span data-start="221.49" data-end="224.918">and sepsis, or blood poisoning, which is not that widely known.</span> <span data-start="224.919" data-end="226.179">And many other diseases.</span> <span data-start="228.976" data-end="232.54">It may be hard to understand what sepsis is,</span> <span data-start="232.541" data-end="234.1">the sepsis refers to the same thing as blood poisoning.</span> <span data-start="234.101" data-end="235.6">So what exactly is it?</span> <span data-start="235.7" data-end="238.71">One of the common examples may be,</span> <span data-start="238.958" data-end="242.112">Let's say someone was bitten by a dog, and he was taken to the hospital, but passed away within a day.</span> <span data-start="242.55" data-end="243.15">Or,</span> <span data-start="243.471" data-end="247.074">Someone had an injection, like glucose solution, and suddenly passed away.</span> <span data-start="247.075" data-end="250.448">These are all cases caused by sepsis.</span> <span data-start="251.106" data-end="254.095">So sepsis, among many acute diseases,</span> <span data-start="254.096" data-end="257.047">induces the most deaths and incurs the highest cost,</span> <span data-start="257.66" data-end="261.361">And what's serious about it is, with each hour of delayed treatment,</span> <span data-start="261.581" data-end="263.885">you get 8% higher death rate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="264.68" data-end="267.668">More than 50% of deaths in the hospitals</span> <span data-start="268.053" data-end="270.199">are related to sepsis or blood poisoning.</span> <span data-start="270.631" data-end="273.474">Then if we can predict this sepsis and report it in advance,</span> <span data-start="273.475" data-end="276.828">we can intuitively understand that so many people can be saved.</span> <span data-start="278.94" data-end="281.708">So now we are working on sepsis,</span> <span data-start="281.709" data-end="284.067">the solution for predicting sepsis outbreaks.</span> <span data-start="284.068" data-end="287.303">Now I will introduce the development process for such a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.059" data-end="290.623">The overall process is shown in this figure.</span> <span data-start="290.624" data-end="296.161">The data of the patients, such as the heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature,</span> <span data-start="296.3" data-end="300">and the blood test results, or X-ray, CT scan image, and prescriptions</span> <span data-start="300.034" data-end="302.31">So we collect all these,</span> <span data-start="302.667" data-end="307.081">and when we enter it into a machine learning model, and this model will,  in 4 hours to 24 hours,</span> <span data-start="307.411" data-end="310.097">Calculate the probability of death or sepsis occurrence for the patient</span> <span data-start="310.4" data-end="313.14">Such results will be displayed on the dashboard,</span> <span data-start="313.419" data-end="316.238">Which is very simple.</span> <span data-start="316.239" data-end="318.517">It's a simple solution.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="320.628" data-end="326.078">So this is the solution we are distributing right now, and</span> <span data-start="326.594" data-end="330.685">the mortality, or death, this solution decides that the person is risky of death in six hours,</span> <span data-start="331.652" data-end="333.543">and it notifies of the risk, and its evidences,</span> <span data-start="333.955" data-end="337.822">It offers the view of those information, such as the current state of the patient.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="339.715" data-end="343.93">I summarized the process for AI solution development into five phases.</span> <span data-start="343.933" data-end="346.557">This is not the official 5-phase,</span> <span data-start="346.762" data-end="350.326">I thought it'd be easier for me to explain if I divide it into 5 phases.</span> <span data-start="350.754" data-end="353.332">I will walk you through each phases</span> <span data-start="355.646" data-end="358.533">First is data refining and model building,</span> <span data-start="358.534" data-end="362.334">this is an essential phase in building an AI.</span> <span data-start="362.721" data-end="364.859">You collect a lot of data</span> <span data-start="364.86" data-end="367.246">As you collect a massive amount of  data,</span> <span data-start="367.575" data-end="370.034">you might encounter with strange data, or useless data,</span> <span data-start="370.034" data-end="371.433">Or irrelevant data.</span> <span data-start="371.634" data-end="373.634">So we do data cleansing and pre-processing.</span> <span data-start="374.321" data-end="375.664">And then for the outcome,</span> <span data-start="375.829" data-end="378.078">We have to define what we are going to predict.</span> <span data-start="378.571" data-end="381.759">When we predict death, death is obvious,</span> <span data-start="382.164" data-end="383.933">You would think, death is death,</span> <span data-start="385.092" data-end="387.51">You might jump into the conclusion that it's very simple to define the outcomes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.731" data-end="390.856">However, it is really complicated since we are predicting acute death</span> <span data-start="390.856" data-end="393.95">and we have to define what acute death is.</span> <span data-start="394.476" data-end="399.303">So the outcomes could be classified into many different definitions.</span> <span data-start="399.933" data-end="403.388">Let's say that the patient dies after 24 hours,</span> <span data-start="403.773" data-end="405.746">if you would like to predict this,</span> <span data-start="406.186" data-end="408.022">what about the patient who died after 25 hours?</span> <span data-start="408.38" data-end="411.634">What about 23 hours? These are all the issues that we have to keep in mind.</span> <span data-start="412.465" data-end="414.832">We think about those various circumstances,</span> <span data-start="414.834" data-end="418.411">and we struggle with many different data,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="418.8" data-end="421.234">And we come up with the model that fits the data best.</span> <span data-start="421.954" data-end="425.956">This is what machine learning research usually does, and actually that's why</span> <span data-start="426.368" data-end="431.433">data refining and such takes up most of the time.</span> <span data-start="432.072" data-end="434.347">I would like to talk more about this process,</span> <span data-start="434.347" data-end="436.899">but I will skip this part for now.</span> <span data-start="439.01" data-end="441.642">And now the model, we developed this model,</span> <span data-start="441.643" data-end="443.32">and we have to deploy it,</span> <span data-start="443.974" data-end="447.072">and this is how the deployment is conducted.</span> <span data-start="447.292" data-end="451.512">Microservices, for example, Web API, most commonly,</span> <span data-start="451.926" data-end="455.399">or Rest API, we deploy models with these,</span> <span data-start="455.82" data-end="459.932">now that we have tensorflow JS, which enables us to</span> <span data-start="460.198" data-end="461.808">upload the model in the web browsers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="462.408" data-end="466.76">So with the tensorflow JS, we can deploy them on  web browsers,</span> <span data-start="468.049" data-end="472.629">And of course processes like optimization for faster models, and compression, are necessary.</span> <span data-start="473.041" data-end="476.798">But in the deployment process, if we actually deploy them, it is reflected in the service,</span> <span data-start="477.374" data-end="479.402">so you have to make sure about this.</span> <span data-start="479.787" data-end="484.106">On my slide, it says it's about the safe usage of AI models,</span> <span data-start="485.244" data-end="488.932">but actually AI models do not always give the right output.</span> <span data-start="489.495" data-end="492.137">Even though it has 99% of accuracy,</span> <span data-start="492.621" data-end="495.336">It means it's accurate for 99 people out of 100, but it will be wrong for one person.</span> <span data-start="495.72" data-end="499.433">And this inaccuracy for one person is critical in many cases.</span> <span data-start="500.764" data-end="503.726">So what if the model suggests wrong output?</span> <span data-start="504.275" data-end="505.125">That's one issue,</span> <span data-start="506.013" data-end="508.437">And then when we have the output from the model,</span> <span data-start="508.438" data-end="510.483">why did the model produce such output?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="511.02" data-end="514.134">How can we trust this output? This would be another issue.</span> <span data-start="515.299" data-end="519.145">So you have to defend such problems or consider such issues</span> <span data-start="519.631" data-end="522.004">to use the AI model safely.</span> <span data-start="523.962" data-end="527.199">So the drawback of the deep learning models is</span> <span data-start="527.42" data-end="530.446">They are very good at predicting the data it already had as the input</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.447" data-end="532.834">However, it cannot really predict well about the data it never learned.</span> <span data-start="533.624" data-end="537.428">For example, a deep learning model which distinguishes between dogs and cats,</span> <span data-start="537.574" data-end="540.881">if you put in a picture of a tiger, this model would,</span> <span data-start="541.076" data-end="543.645">It should say "this is neither a dog nor a cat"</span> <span data-start="544.185" data-end="547.434">but instead it will say that "it is a cat."</span> <span data-start="548.178" data-end="550.797">So when we develop machine learning models,</span> <span data-start="550.966" data-end="554.534">we test all of the possible inputs,</span> <span data-start="554.634" data-end="556.634">and even if there's some malfunctioning in the model</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="557.233" data-end="560.875">We need a lot of code to defend such cases in the solution phase.</span> <span data-start="561.341" data-end="563.973">If we provide machine learning models for this service,</span> <span data-start="563.974" data-end="566.046">we are usually concerned about these kind of things</span> <span data-start="567.785" data-end="572.611">so we need the test results of machine learning models for some random input values</span> <span data-start="572.612" data-end="575.353">This is usually called the property based testing</span> <span data-start="575.354" data-end="576.916">you test the model with random inputs</span> <span data-start="577.246" data-end="580.262">and observe what kinds of inputs fail the test</span> <span data-start="580.509" data-end="583.169">The test process for this is called property-based testing.</span> <span data-start="584.028" data-end="587.386">We conduct the property-based testing with Javascript</span> <span data-start="587.694" data-end="592.219">And the libraries like JS Verify or Fast Check supports this.</span> <span data-start="593.453" data-end="597.134">additionally, when the model produces an output.</span> <span data-start="597.233" data-end="600.034">the issue of how can we trust the output,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="600.034" data-end="602.667">It's about how accurate the results are.</span> <span data-start="603.215" data-end="605.93">So we have added a module that can be analyzed,</span> <span data-start="606.039" data-end="608.733">and so we were able to analyze and debug the module</span> <span data-start="609.462" data-end="611.134">If you look at the image on the right,</span> <span data-start="611.135" data-end="614.159">the image on the right bottom will be more intuitive</span> <span data-start="614.65" data-end="616.419">Here's a chest x-ray</span> <span data-start="616.42" data-end="620.601">Let's say I want to know if this person's health condition is in danger or not by looking at this x-ray</span> <span data-start="621.093" data-end="622.603">If you give this two images to the model,</span> <span data-start="623.3" data-end="626.661">and it says, 'the x-ray shows that he is in danger'</span> <span data-start="626.853" data-end="629.485">Then I need to know the exact reason why</span> <span data-start="629.486" data-end="633.379">to see if the model's answer is correct or not.</span> <span data-start="633.763" data-end="637.354">By putting an interpretable module, as we did for the right image,</span> <span data-start="637.603" data-end="642.09">it will tell us the reason why it's saying that. And we can see if it's working well or not.</span> <span data-start="643.635" data-end="647.433">So if we add an interpretable module,</span> <span data-start="647.434" data-end="649.661">we can use a much stabilized AI module.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="649.915" data-end="651.423">Thus, when using interpreter modules</span> <span data-start="651.835" data-end="656.6">it's important to visualize it well when using the AI model.</span> <span data-start="659.84" data-end="663.533">And if I add some more explanation to the property based testing,</span> <span data-start="663.534" data-end="666.06">This is part of our solution code,</span> <span data-start="668.124" data-end="672.429">This code tests whether the people with sepsis actually</span> <span data-start="672.534" data-end="673.415">score higher on the sepsis risk test.</span> </p>
