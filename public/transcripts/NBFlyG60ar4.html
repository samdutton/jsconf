the really</span> <span data-start="546.32" data-end="549.5">cool thing about the ti calculators is</span> <span data-start="549.5" data-end="551.48">that it kind of has this different</span> <span

you go back okay I see and the</span> <span data-start="598.58" data-end="602.15">tricks you learn in like building the or</span> <span data-start="602.15" data-end="604.55">like using the calculator

something happens where you</span> <span data-start="630.74" data-end="633.2">discover that TI programs can have our</span> <span data-start="633.2" data-end="634.76">sorry Ti calculators can have programs</span> <span data-start="634.76" data-end="636.32">either that's because your teachers like</span> <span data-start="636.32" data-end="638.18">hey download this math program or more</span> <span data-start="638.18" data-end="641.35">likely because you downloaded Tetris but</span> <span data-start="641.35" data-end="643.64">ii like the spark goes off in your mind</span> <span

data-end="663.95">about this is that this is almost a</span> <span data-start="663.95" data-end="665.87">functioning program right like what</span> <span data-start="665.87" data-end="668.56">you've

<p><span data-start="807.65" data-end="810.65">I'm talking about incremental skills</span> <span data-start="810.65" data-end="811.94">that's where my bias is going to show</span> <span

if this is like incremental</span> <span data-start="821.96" data-end="825.08">skill this is what appliance looks like</span> <span data-start="825.08" data-end="827.72">to me and basically it's not a spectrum</span> <span data-start="827.72" data-end="831.11">there's like huge gaps that require like</span> <span data-start="831.11" data-end="833.36">lots of activation energy either like</span>

<span data-start="861.41" data-end="864.58">is kind of this appliance model you know</span> <span data-start="864.58" data-end="867.35">somewhere between you know my mom makes</span> <span

data-start="912.44" data-end="913.76">of different like learning curves and</span> <span data-start="913.76" data-end="915.92">then you pay under $99 to get like a</span> <span data-start="915.92" data-end="917.78">developer account and then your</span> <span data-start="917.78" data-end="921.8">programming I guess so I think that in</span> <span data-start="921.8" data-end="924.44">the iOS

data-start="934.6" data-end="936.86">focused goal and then if you want to</span> <span data-start="936.86" data-end="939.11">program it's very divided like you</span> <span data-start="939.11"

data-end="951.079">like an iOS versus the web thing because</span> <span data-start="951.079" data-end="952.64">kind of the point of my talk is that I</span> <span data-start="952.64"

data-start="966.8" data-end="968.45">of the way you did things and now I</span> <span data-start="968.45" data-end="970.19">think what's happened is we've made the</span> <span data-start="970.19"
