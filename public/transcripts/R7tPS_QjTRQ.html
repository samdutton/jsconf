data-start="32.009" data-end="35.07">in node as it is right now one of the</span> <span data-start="35.07" data-end="37.89">main reasons is that a javascript is</span> <span data-start="37.89"

about any programming paradigm that</span> <span data-start="44.219" data-end="46.59">you want which means that it's hard to</span> <span data-start="46.59" data-end="49.17">make a static pattern you

<span data-start="54.449" data-end="57.27">bad it's a it's an insecure default kind</span> <span data-start="57.27" data-end="63.42">of thing right so happy happens to help</span> <span data-start="63.42" data-end="66.96">that problem a little bit by creating</span> <span data-start="66.96" data-end="71.159">some more structure which you can see we</span> <span data-start="71.159" data-end="74.22">can do this in rails because the rails</span> <span data-start="74.22" data-end="76.2">has clearly defined patterns and secure</span> <span data-start="76.2" data-end="78.42">defaults it's a lot more structured than</span> <span data-start="78.42" data-end="81.81">most note frameworks are that's why you</span> <span data-start="81.81" data-end="83.25">can do things like break man which</span> <span data-start="83.25" data-end="85.35">everybody loves really simple to use and</span> <span data-start="85.35" data-end="88.799">it works because there's good defaults</span> <span

data-end="112.649">clearly defined patterns instead you got</span> <span data-start="112.649" data-end="116.009">to handle them yourselves the trade-off</span> <span data-start="116.009" data-end="118.11">for the freedom is similar to the</span> <span data-start="118.11" data-end="119.28">problem that you're going to find it any</span> <span data-start="119.28" data-end="122.399">complex parser if you want the parser to</span> <span data-start="122.399" data-end="124.2">handle the input well you have to define</span> <span data-start="124.2"

data-end="141.03">though and happy validating all data</span> <span data-start="141.03" data-end="143.88">structures is the norm rather than an</span> <span data-start="143.88" data-end="146.37">outlier it's it's what people do the</span> <span data-start="146.37" data-end="148.08">more common thing you'll see in a happy</span> <span data-start="148.08" data-end="150.99">application is validators for everything</span> <span data-start="150.99" data-end="156.39">which is awesome structure and happy is</span> <span data-start="156.39" data-end="159.09">not optional it's consistent it's</span> <span data-start="159.09" data-end="161.73">validated it doesn't let you do a lot of</span> <span data-start="161.73" data-end="164.52">crazy things that other frameworks let</span> <span data-start="164.52" data-end="166.86">you do which I really a security person</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.86" data-end="169.74">I think that's great and it allows me to</span> <span data-start="169.74" data-end="172.35">parse the routing table it allows me to</span> <span data-start="172.35" data-end="175.17">parse various configuration options</span> <span data-start="175.17" data-end="177.39">within the application and actually</span> <span data-start="177.39" data-end="179.19">verify that some of those things are</span> <span data-start="179.19" data-end="182.37">secure so laut is already utilized this</span> <span data-start="182.37" data-end="185.91">and as we saw in previous talks things</span> <span data-start="185.91" data-end="188.58">like happy swagger have utilized this to</span> <span data-start="188.58" data-end="191.82">make auto documentation tools so you can</span> <span data-start="191.82" data-end="194.61">see documentation for your routes well I</span> <span data-start="194.61" data-end="197.459">was working on something similar a</span> <span data-start="197.459" data-end="199.08">couple months ago and thought you know</span> <span data-start="199.08" data-end="201.54">what I wonder if I could use this to</span> <span data-start="201.54" data-end="204.72">actually test the application and fuzz</span> <span data-start="204.72" data-end="206.94">it without having to give it a whole lot</span> <span data-start="206.94" data-end="213.48">of manual context and this brings us</span> <span data-start="213.48" data-end="215.79">back to the beginning the security</span> <span data-start="215.79" data-end="217.41">animation is difficult because there's</span> <span data-start="217.41" data-end="220.22">so little consistent structuring node</span> <span data-start="220.22" data-end="224.37">but happy solves that problem so break</span> <span data-start="224.37" data-end="226.23">man is two rails as a bizarre lout is</span> <span data-start="226.23" data-end="228.36">the happy that's kind of what I'm trying</span> <span data-start="228.36" data-end="232.23">to build for the happy space it's a work</span> <span data-start="232.23" data-end="234.93">in progress I've begun work on it I had</span> <span data-start="234.93" data-end="236.73">something that has worked but it's a</span> <span data-start="236.73" data-end="240.18">very very complex problem and I'll just</span> <span data-start="240.18" data-end="242.73">say that converting from happy 72 happy</span> <span data-start="242.73" data-end="244.769">eight completely broke everything</span> <span data-start="244.769" data-end="246.84">because when you're dealing with like</span> <span data-start="246.84" data-end="250.019">parsing complex internal routing tables</span> <span data-start="250.019" data-end="254.01">it's it's a lot more complex of a change</span> <span data-start="254.01" data-end="257.959">right so I've got laut as a foundation</span> <span data-start="257.959" data-end="261.87">for the beginnings of the the parsing of</span> <span data-start="261.87" data-end="263.669">the routing table with some things added</span> <span data-start="263.669" data-end="266.97">on there so I can I can warn about some</span> <span data-start="266.97" data-end="269.65">basic stuff</span> <span data-start="269.66" data-end="271.98">but there's also parts of your</span> <span data-start="271.98" data-end="274.35">application like your route handlers</span> <span data-start="274.35" data-end="277.17">themselves that are still not going to</span> <span data-start="277.17" data-end="279.99">be using a necessarily a set pattern</span> <span data-start="279.99" data-end="281.91">like you can use promises or you can use</span> <span data-start="281.91" data-end="285.39">callbacks you can use any kind of</span> <span data-start="285.39" data-end="288.06">database you want or connection library</span> <span data-start="288.06" data-end="290.25">that you want right so that kind of</span> <span data-start="290.25" data-end="292.05">stuff is difficult to parse once again</span> <span data-start="292.05" data-end="296.43">so what I've done is to use that routing</span> <span data-start="296.43" data-end="298.32">table information to pull out your</span> <span data-start="298.32" data-end="299.73">parameters that you're going to be</span> <span data-start="299.73" data-end="303.27">expecting in the API get types for them</span> <span data-start="303.27" data-end="305.61">like string number whatever find out</span> <span data-start="305.61" data-end="306.93">what you're looking for in the API</span> <span data-start="306.93" data-end="310.86">endpoint and actually inject a very</span> <span data-start="310.86" data-end="312.9">complicated set of fuzzing algorithms</span> <span data-start="312.9" data-end="316.29">that I don't have time to explain but</span> <span data-start="316.29" data-end="318.75">yeah it's pretty cool stuff I'm excited</span> <span data-start="318.75" data-end="324.84">mostly about that part so given the lack</span> <span data-start="324.84" data-end="327.18">of the developer friendly API and most</span> <span data-start="327.18" data-end="329.4">security tools they're kind of a pain to</span> <span data-start="329.4" data-end="332.31">work with even if you do security</span> <span data-start="332.31" data-end="334.89">they're terrible I'm sure your thing in</span> <span data-start="334.89" data-end="337.14">what constitutes these secure defaults</span> <span data-start="337.14" data-end="339.479">that you're talking about is bizarre all</span> <span data-start="339.479" data-end="341.85">out really effective and most</span> <span data-start="341.85" data-end="344.01">importantly how much time and effort is</span> <span data-start="344.01" data-end="348.54">this going to cost me to actually use so</span> <span data-start="348.54" data-end="350.49">secure defaults this is what I have</span> <span data-start="350.49" data-end="353.76">right now these components were working</span> <span data-start="353.76" data-end="357">at some point now they're kind of</span> <span data-start="357" data-end="359.1">disconnected and I've got to link them</span> <span data-start="359.1" data-end="360.54">back together so unfortunately won't be</span> <span data-start="360.54" data-end="363.12">able to have a demo but are there an</span> <span data-start="363.12" data-end="365.729">authenticated routes this first one</span> <span data-start="365.729" data-end="367.47">really simple you just check the route</span> <span data-start="367.47" data-end="369.419">handler see if there's there's a no</span> <span data-start="369.419" data-end="371.97">offset all the routes have CSRF</span> <span data-start="371.97" data-end="374.94">protection on are the input fields</span> <span data-start="374.94" data-end="377.72">validated or rejected do you allow</span> <span data-start="377.72" data-end="380.13">unvalidated input fields do you have</span> <span data-start="380.13" data-end="383.18">empty validate handlers in your routes</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="386.19">and as their sensitive data being</span> <span data-start="386.19" data-end="389.1">compared in securely I can check that</span> <span data-start="389.1" data-end="392.04">with some simple static analysis stuff</span> <span data-start="392.04" data-end="395.31">as well so is bizarre a lot effective</span> <span data-start="395.31" data-end="398.37">well within the first 10 seconds of</span> <span data-start="398.37" data-end="400.08">turning it on I found a denial of</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="401.52">service
