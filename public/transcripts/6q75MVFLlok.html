70 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="364.71" data-end="367.979">but if you are on on 3G which is pretty</span> <span data-start="367.979" data-end="369.87">common and in most countries this

data-end="443.52">true so now that we opened the</span> <span data-start="443.52" data-end="445.83">connection we can happily start sending</span> <span data-start="445.83" data-end="448.289">data in full-speed right well of course</span> <span data-start="448.289" data-end="454.02">not doesn't work because TCP has a bunch</span> <span data-start="454.02" data-end="457.11">of algorithms in place that protect the</span> <span data-start="457.11" data-end="460.229">network from collapsing because you</span> <span data-start="460.229" data-end="461.849">cannot just send data if your recipient</span> <span data-start="461.849" data-end="463.74">does not be it's not able to handle the</span> <span data-start="463.74" data-end="465.719">data and then you would just congest the</span> <span data-start="465.719" data-end="467.939">entire network and it will break down so</span> <span data-start="467.939" data-end="473.219">and one-one-one algorithm is called tcp</span> <span data-start="473.219" data-end="475.709">slow-start and it works in the way that</span> <span data-start="475.709" data-end="478.62">when you start sending data it only does</span> <span data-start="478.62" data-end="480.06">it slowly so you have to send one</span> <span data-start="480.06" data-end="481.56">package and then you have to wait to get</span> <span data-start="481.56" data-end="483.36">one back before you can send even more</span> <span data-start="483.36" data-end="486.209">data and this slowly increases until you</span> <span data-start="486.209" data-end="488.52">at some point reach maximum maximum</span> <span data-start="488.52" data-end="491.879">speed and usually this amount of data is</span> <span data-start="491.879" data-end="494.039">14 kilobytes so if you happen to manage</span> <span data-start="494.039" data-end="496.469">to get your entire website into those 14</span> <span data-start="496.469" data-end="497.789">kilobytes then you have only one</span> <span data-start="497.789" data-end="499.62">additional one trip which would be</span> <span data-start="499.62" data-end="501.779">awesome but I don't know if anybody is</span> <span data-start="501.779" data-end="505.319">capable of doing that nowadays so yeah</span> <span data-start="505.319" data-end="508.319">and the thing is that when you're using</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="508.319" data-end="512.069">HTTP one and not HTTP two then you have</span> <span data-start="512.069" data-end="514.5">this tcp slow-start punishment so to</span> <span

data-start="535.57" data-end="537.76">because in this example it didn't matter</span> <span data-start="537.76" data-end="541.6">much if I have 100 M it's 100 connection</span> <span data-start="541.6" data-end="544.6">or 50 m 8 or 10 or 1 gigabit because we</span> <span data-start="544.6" data-end="549.34">didn't send large data yet and engineers</span> <span data-start="549.34" data-end="551.59">over the years came up with a lot of</span> <span data-start="551.59" data-end="554.74">techniques to mitigate those issues and</span> <span data-start="554.74" data-end="557.17">to decrease latency so first of all</span> <span data-start="557.17" data-end="560.05">there is now HTTP to multiplexing which</span> <span data-start="560.05" data-end="563.38">allows you to reuse open

data-end="1174.54">will not get it will not be executed so</span> <span data-start="1174.54" data-end="1176.07">it's totally safe to prefetch for</span> <span data-start="1176.07" data-end="1177.54">example scripts limiters they would just</span> <span data-start="1177.54" data-end="1179.76">be downloaded and with a low priority</span> <span data-start="1179.76" data-end="1182.04">and nothing will be done with it until</span> <span data-start="1182.04" data-end="1184.05">you two need it and it would like to</span> <span data-start="1184.05" data-end="1186.09">give to two examples for that as well</span> <span data-start="1186.09" data-end="1189.9">so going back to my cat store maybe so</span> <span data-start="1189.9" data-end="1192.69">usually an online store flow is is</span> <span data-start="1192.69" data-end="1194.31">pretty clear so I have a product page</span> <span data-start="1194.31" data-end="1196.83">and then I put products into my cart and</span> <span data-start="1196.83" data-end="1199.08">then I go to the cart page and then from</span> <span data-start="1199.08" data-end="1200.79">the cart page I go to the checkout which</span> <span data-start="1200.79" data-end="1203.34">sometimes is a separate check out a</span> <span data-start="1203.34" data-end="1203.91">separate</span> <span data-start="1203.91" data-end="1205.89">application and then I will do I will</span> <span data-start="1205.89" data-end="1208.44">give you my money there basically so</span> <span data-start="1208.44" data-end="1209.88">what you can do when I'm on the cart</span> <span data-start="1209.88" data-end="1212.67">page you can be pretty certain that I'm</span> <span data-start="1212.67" data-end="1214.29">going to go to the checkout as well</span> <span data-start="1214.29" data-end="1215.79">because if I'm already in the card why</span> <span data-start="1215.79" data-end="1216.36">wouldn't I</span> <span data-start="1216.36" data-end="1219">so you can at this point already</span> <span data-start="1219" data-end="1222.39">prefetch the the files that your app is</span> <span data-start="1222.39" data-end="1224.61">going to need for for the checkout</span> <span data-start="1224.61" data-end="1226.59">experience and then just prefetch them</span> <span data-start="1226.59" data-end="1228.39">and as soon as I hit this go to or</span> <span data-start="1228.39" data-end="1230.13">proceed to checkout button the stuff</span> <span data-start="1230.13" data-end="1232.32">will already be there and leading to</span> <span data-start="1232.32" data-end="1237.5">better experience the second example is</span> <span data-start="1237.5" data-end="1240.06">similar but maybe a bit different so if</span> <span data-start="1240.06" data-end="1241.74">you have a login page lock in a login</span> <span data-start="1241.74" data-end="1244.17">form then it's also you can also be</span> <span data-start="1244.17" data-end="1246.3">pretty certain that my intent is is to</span> <span data-start="1246.3" data-end="1247.98">log in and use the locked-in experience</span> <span data-start="1247.98" data-end="1251.31">so why not just real Oh a prefetch the</span> <span data-start="1251.31" data-end="1254.04">the assets images in scripts that you</span> <span data-start="1254.04" data-end="1255.6">need for the locked experience at this</span> <span data-start="1255.6" data-end="1258.12">point already because it doesn't hurt if</span> <span data-start="1258.12" data-end="1259.77">you are pretty sure that that I will</span> <span data-start="1259.77" data-end="1262.11">need them then you can use the bandwidth</span> <span data-start="1262.11" data-end="1264.57">and just give me a better better</span> <span data-start="1264.57" data-end="1268.5">experience and the browser support also</span> <span data-start="1268.5" data-end="1271.17">is pretty good it got all of this got a</span> <span data-start="1271.17" data-end="1272.97">lot better in recent months because in</span> <span data-start="1272.97" data-end="1274.86">this case not but also safari naira</span> <span data-start="1274.86" data-end="1276.93">safari started supporting we saw since</span> <span data-start="1276.93" data-end="1279.48">apart from this one apparently so this</span> <span data-start="1279.48" data-end="1280.47">is pretty good and this is even</span> <span data-start="1280.47" data-end="1283.47">supported in IE in edge so pretty safe</span> <span data-start="1283.47" data-end="1287.61">to use the last one I would like to talk</span> <span data-start="1287.61" data-end="1290.79">about is also the newest one and maybe</span> <span data-start="1290.79" data-end="1294.06">even the most interesting one it is</span> <span data-start="1294.06" data-end="1297.06">called preload and you can use preload</span> <span data-start="1297.06" data-end="1301.38">to download resources that you need for</span> <span data-start="1301.38" data-end="1302.82">the current navigation for the current</span> <span data-start="1302.82" data-end="1304.8">page view but that the browser cannot</span> <span data-start="1304.8" data-end="1307.47">know about yet but you do know so now I</span> <span data-start="1307.47" data-end="1310.17">would like to go back to my my to a bad</span> <span data-start="1310.17" data-end="1314.73">font example and just briefly go go back</span> <span data-start="1314.73" data-end="1317.49">to the initial initial waterfall chart</span> <span data-start="1317.49" data-end="1320.31">like the first one like just to recap</span> <span data-start="1320.31" data-end="1322.83">that we had to download both CSS files</span> <span data-start="1322.83" data-end="1324.18">and only afterwards the webform was</span> <span data-start="1324.18" data-end="1326.25">downloaded and I know I only said that</span> <span data-start="1326.25" data-end="1328.38">when we are using Google Wave phones we</span> <span data-start="1328.38" data-end="1331.23">cannot know the path but let's just</span> <span data-start="1331.23" data-end="1332.97">pretend for this example that we can</span> <span data-start="1332.97" data-end="1335.22">know the path and if you actually wanted</span> <span data-start="1335.22" data-end="1336.75">to use this technique you could also</span> <span data-start="1336.75" data-end="1337.59">consider</span> <span data-start="1337.59" data-end="1339.96">hosting the web font yourself and be in</span> <span data-start="1339.96" data-end="1343.38">control of the UL and then no no wait</span> <span data-start="1343.38" data-end="1347.76">for sure and all right we got one too</span> <span data-start="1347.76" data-end="1351.18">fast and sorry so and so what you can do</span> <span data-start="1351.18" data-end="1353.94">is add at this link tech we've preload</span> <span data-start="1353.94" data-end="1355.41">and then set it to the edge proof that</span> <span data-start="1355.41" data-end="1358.05">we know pretend that we know and what</span> <span data-start="1358.05" data-end="1360.27">happens then is if you look at the</span> <span data-start="1360.27" data-end="1361.98">resulting waterfall chart that the web</span> <span data-start="1361.98" data-end="1364.59">phone itself will be downloaded and</span> <span data-start="1364.59" data-end="1366.45">parallel with all the other stuff and</span> <span data-start="1366.45" data-end="1370.7">will be will be ready much much earlier</span> <span data-start="1370.7" data-end="1372.84">which was kind of cool you can use it</span> <span data-start="1372.84" data-end="1374.46">for for all kinds of stuff and we will</span> <span data-start="1374.46" data-end="1376.29">come to to that right now because if you</span> <span data-start="1376.29" data-end="1378.48">might have noticed there was this s</span> <span data-start="1378.48" data-end="1382.2">attribute in here and the S attribute is</span> <span data-start="1382.2" data-end="1385.59">the B crest type and you can have plenty</span> <span data-start="1385.59" data-end="1387.63">of them you can use scripts for example</span> <span data-start="1387.63" data-end="1389.7">if you have third-party scripts that you</span> <span data-start="1389.7" data-end="1391.65">are loading by an inline script loader</span> <span data-start="1391.65" data-end="1395.24">or you can have images that maybe are</span> <span data-start="1395.24" data-end="1397.41">referenced as background images in your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1397.41" data-end="1400.26">CSS files and you can even preload fetch</span> <span data-start="1400.26" data-end="1402.9">requests which bring which gives us</span> <span data-start="1402.9" data-end="1406.05">interesting interesting new stuff which</span> <span data-start="1406.05" data-end="1407.61">I don't want to get into detail right</span> <span data-start="1407.61" data-end="1410.73">now but why do we even have to set</span> <span data-start="1410.73" data-end="1413.25">request type why do we need it so it's</span> <span data-start="1413.25" data-end="1415.29">needed so that the browser can</span> <span data-start="1415.29" data-end="1419.37">prioritize the request because style</span> <span data-start="1419.37" data-end="1421.17">sheets might might be downloaded with a</span> <span data-start="1421.17" data-end="1423.42">higher priority than images but it is</span> <span data-start="1423.42" data-end="1426.21">also used to set the appropriate except</span> <span data-start="1426.21" data-end="1429.36">header so that the browser sense doesn't</span> <span data-start="1429.36" data-end="1431.22">request an image when you actually want</span> <span data-start="1431.22" data-end="1432.75">one a script from you or from your web</span> <span data-start="1432.75" data-end="1434.88">server so that you can deliver the right</span> <span data-start="1434.88" data-end="1437.88">thing but it's also used to enforce the</span> <span data-start="1437.88" data-end="1439.59">content security policy and if you were</span> <span data-start="1439.59" data-end="1441.06">in the first talk this morning you might</span> <span data-start="1441.06" data-end="1442.44">already know what it is about but</span> <span data-start="1442.44" data-end="1445.26">content security basically allows you in</span> <span data-start="1445.26" data-end="1447.51">this case to specify from which host you</span> <span data-start="1447.51" data-end="1450.66">want to allow to download resources from</span> <span data-start="1450.66" data-end="1452.28">for example you could say I only want to</span> <span data-start="1452.28" data-end="1454.5">allow images to be downloaded from image</span> <span data-start="1454.5" data-end="1455.46">server com</span> <span data-start="1455.46" data-end="1457.65">whereas scripts should be downloaded</span> <span data-start="1457.65" data-end="1460.44">from script server calm and in order to</span> <span data-start="1460.44" data-end="1462.33">enforce that Google will air Google the</span> <span data-start="1462.33" data-end="1466.17">browser needs to know with what kind of</span> <span data-start="1466.17" data-end="1470.58">file type it is dealing with and if you</span> <span data-start="1470.58" data-end="1471.3">fail</span> <span data-start="1471.3" data-end="1473.79">to set a resource type or set incorrect</span> <span data-start="1473.79" data-end="1475.05">one then you will have basically have</span> <span data-start="1475.05" data-end="1477.63">double fetches and preload will not give</span> <span data-start="1477.63" data-end="1480.04">you anything</span> <span data-start="1480.05" data-end="1483.78">one other thing is there's responsive</span> <span data-start="1483.78" data-end="1486.06">design so if you which is basically</span> <span data-start="1486.06" data-end="1487.77">trying to make your your web app work</span> <span data-start="1487.77" data-end="1490.17">across screen sizes right and oftentimes</span> <span data-start="1490.17" data-end="1494.43">you need to download resources depending</span> <span data-start="1494.43" data-end="1496.05">on the screen size for example the</span> <span data-start="1496.05" data-end="1497.97">background image for for mobile app for</span> <span data-start="1497.97" data-end="1499.65">mobile version might be a completely</span> <span data-start="1499.65" data-end="1501.15">different one than the one for the</span> <span data-start="1501.15" data-end="1503.7">desktop experience and usually people</span> <span data-start="1503.7" data-end="1506.07">use media queries for that so you</span> <span data-start="1506.07" data-end="1509.16">specify a max width and then if the max</span> <span data-start="1509.16" data-end="1512.19">width of your device is in the is in</span> <span data-start="1512.19" data-end="1514.05">this realm then it will download this</span> <span data-start="1514.05" data-end="1516.3">and otherwise the other luckily browser</span> <span data-start="1516.3" data-end="1518.13">vendors have this also in mind when they</span> <span data-start="1518.13" data-end="1522.63">invented preload so you can use the</span> <span data-start="1522.63" data-end="1525.06">media actually boot and in preload in</span> <span data-start="1525.06" data-end="1526.77">the link tag as well and then said max</span> <span data-start="1526.77" data-end="1528.72">for example the max width and then the</span> <span data-start="1528.72" data-end="1530.85">browser will only download a preload</span> <span data-start="1530.85" data-end="1532.83">those where the media query actually</span> <span data-start="1532.83" data-end="1537.51">matches and here is the one the one</span> <span data-start="1537.51" data-end="1540.27">resource in where support got</span> <span data-start="1540.27" data-end="1542.7">significantly better in the last three</span> <span data-start="1542.7" data-end="1544.05">months even I think so it's now</span> <span data-start="1544.05" data-end="1546.98">supported in all major browsers but IE</span> <span data-start="1546.98" data-end="1549.54">and it's even already in at 17</span> <span data-start="1549.54" data-end="1552.24">apparently so I think it's now ready</span> <span data-start="1552.24" data-end="1554.91">ready to be used and I would definitely</span> <span data-start="1554.91" data-end="1559.83">look into that so and with that I'm</span> <span data-start="1559.83" data-end="1562.5">almost almost finished but I would like</span> <span data-start="1562.5"
