<p><span data-start="86.549" data-end="90.53">And it was a video game device that was educational.</span> <span data-start="90.53" data-end="97.99">You were able to do math problems, interior design and just decorated houses which has</span> <span data-start="97.99" data-end="107.54">forever ruined me from playing The Sims, it was my first tangible experience with connecting</span> <span data-start="107.54" data-end="113.56">to technology and from then on, I was pretty much ruined.</span> <span data-start="113.56" data-end="119.7">This thing, right here, is Are You Afraid of the Dark, it tail of Orpheus' curse, and</span> <span data-start="119.7" data-end="122.37">was a tale adventure game that was released in 1994.</span> <span data-start="122.37" data-end="129.06">And this is, you're doing typical are you afraid of the dark stuff, like, searching</span> <span data-start="129.06" data-end="138.239">for mummies, and I didn't have a computer, but I had friends who did, like, I was super</span> <span data-start="138.239" data-end="140.769">hooked to anything that I could get my hands on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="140.769" data-end="143.629">And then I did got my own computer.</span> <span data-start="143.629" data-end="155.209">And if you know what this is, this is AOHell and it's a wares tool.</span> <span data-start="155.209" data-end="161.23">Now when I get a PC, I was like, now I have knowledge at my fingertips.</span> <span data-start="161.23" data-end="173.889">Unfortunately, my dad had AOL, so it was  —  but once I got AOHell I was able to manipulate</span> <span data-start="173.889" data-end="178.879">some of the code that was in the programs and do horrible things like post linguistics</span> <span data-start="178.879" data-end="185.29">into chatrooms that if somebody clicked it, it would kick them off of their dial-up modem</span> <span data-start="185.29" data-end="190.62">and then from there I went on to IRC, and this was when I first really started interacting</span> <span data-start="190.62" data-end="191.639">with people.</span> <span data-start="191.639" data-end="197.269">And I chose this screenshot because it's the first way that I ever pirated things on the</span> <span data-start="197.269" data-end="198.269">Internet.</span> <span data-start="198.269" data-end="202.459">These are XDCC bots if anybody remembers what those were.</span> <span data-start="202.459" data-end="207.76">Basically an album would be so large so you would have to send a message to a bot that</span> <span data-start="207.76" data-end="215.079">had a bunch of compressed files that you would get it piece-by-piece so if your dial-up got</span> <span data-start="215.079" data-end="218.659">disconnected because your sister picked up the phone or whatever, you would be able to</span> <span data-start="218.659" data-end="221.709">pick it up and abstract it later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.709" data-end="226.639">So these were my first experiences communicating with Apple on the Internet.</span> <span data-start="226.639" data-end="232.829">Some of it is nice, some of it is illegal, but basically I was like, yeah, this is rad,</span> <span data-start="232.829" data-end="235.15">I need to do more.</span> <span data-start="235.15" data-end="240.659">And then I discovered GeoCities and angel fire.</span> <span data-start="240.659" data-end="252.419">I  made</span> <span data-start="252.419" data-end="256.34">sights for Blink 182 because I was super obsessed with them and thought they were really cool.</span> <span data-start="256.34" data-end="263.199">And I also thought I was super punk so I had animated dolls and stuff.</span> <span data-start="263.199" data-end="266.46">And one of them was a site when I started learning how to program.</span> <span data-start="266.46" data-end="270.11">And I didn't start learning how to program because I love programming, and I'm going</span> <span data-start="270.11" data-end="272.78">to go to school, and I want to make a lot of money.</span> <span data-start="272.78" data-end="277.57">I just did it out of necessity because I wanted my voice to be heard, and I wanted to be out</span> <span data-start="277.57" data-end="280.34">there.</span> <span data-start="280.34" data-end="282.5">And then I found Web Rings.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="282.5" data-end="288.71">So when I started thinking about my journey and connections with the Internet, I realize</span> <span data-start="288.71" data-end="293.34">so much of it was the result of exploration and discovery and it was pretty much because</span> <span data-start="293.34" data-end="298.33">I was not happy with the life that I had in rural Florida, the people that were around</span> <span data-start="298.33" data-end="299.77">me, I didn't get along with.</span> <span data-start="299.77" data-end="302.49">They didn't have common interests?</span> <span data-start="302.49" data-end="306.32">But people on the Internet did and I could find anybody that was interested in any of</span> <span data-start="306.32" data-end="307.509">the same things that I was.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="307.509" data-end="312.59">And I could talk to them and we could exchange ideas and it was really inspiring.</span> <span data-start="312.59" data-end="316.77">It was a type of escapism that opened me up to new ideas.</span> <span data-start="316.77" data-end="321.94">And when I started making sites on GeoCities and AngelFire, I realized how fun it was to</span> <span data-start="321.94" data-end="324.789">learn and share that information.</span> <span data-start="324.789" data-end="334.069">But then, through Web Rings in about earlyish 2000, I discovered personal sites.</span> <span data-start="334.069" data-end="339.98">So I saw these networks of extremely well curated sites, impeccably designed with attention</span> <span data-start="339.98" data-end="344.85">to detail, carefully written entries and crafted lists for other people to follow and check</span> <span data-start="344.85" data-end="345.85">out.</span> <span data-start="345.85" data-end="348.229">And they weren't just sites like we have personal sites now.</span> <span data-start="348.229" data-end="350.41">I'm sure we all have personal sites.</span> <span data-start="350.41" data-end="351.87">We all have blogs.</span> <span data-start="351.87" data-end="353.539">This is pre-WordPress.</span> <span data-start="353.539" data-end="358.11">This is actually a software called Gray Matter which was in perl and just saved your entries</span> <span data-start="358.11" data-end="359.289">locally.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.289" data-end="366.4">But we were educating and helping each other share knowledge and I wasn't because they</span> <span data-start="366.4" data-end="371.389">were trying to boost their ego about how much stuff they knew, or how many things they could,</span> <span data-start="371.389" data-end="373.199">you know, share out there.</span> <span data-start="373.199" data-end="377.699">It was people who were self-taught and learning how their own design, learning how to do their</span> <span data-start="377.699" data-end="382.419">own scrollable divs and their own link changes.</span> <span data-start="382.419" data-end="384.349">And it was mostly younger women.</span> <span data-start="384.349" data-end="385.59">And it was really cool.</span> <span data-start="385.59" data-end="390.19">And it was really welcoming that you could be able to find out how to, you know, size</span> <span data-start="390.19" data-end="394.599">your font the best way so that eight pixels, or ten pixels looked the coolest.</span> <span data-start="394.599" data-end="400.02">You could learn how to use grunge brushes on Photoshop which were, like, the coolest</span> <span data-start="400.02" data-end="401.969">things ever.</span> <span data-start="401.969" data-end="405.069">So I found all these other teenagers and I knew that I really wanted to be a part of</span> <span data-start="405.069" data-end="406.939">it.</span> <span data-start="406.939" data-end="412.05">So I still remember the first site that I came across when I was, like, cool, this is</span> <span data-start="412.05" data-end="413.05">awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="413.05" data-end="415.61">I found this woman, her name is Melissa.</span> <span data-start="415.61" data-end="420.629">This is gleeb.com and she was the first person that I really found where I was, like, wow</span> <span data-start="420.629" data-end="422.44">I really like her entries.</span> <span data-start="422.44" data-end="427.06">I really, really like the music she likes, all the things that are really cool.</span> <span data-start="427.06" data-end="433.59">Also, content warning, this is 2002, 2010, there might be some bad things in all of these</span> <span data-start="433.59" data-end="435.5">entries that you will see, fair warning.</span> <span data-start="435.5" data-end="438.009">I didn't proofread.</span> <span data-start="438.009" data-end="440.28">I loved all the other sites that she hosted.</span> <span data-start="440.28" data-end="444.93">A host/hostee relationship is when someone has their own domain name and then they gave</span> <span data-start="444.93" data-end="448.27">their space to other people, and you can share.</span> <span data-start="448.27" data-end="451.9">And usually it's people who would have similar interests and so I could go to all these other</span> <span data-start="451.9" data-end="458.669">sites and find people like Melissa that I identified with, and I wanted to be like Mel,</span> <span data-start="458.669" data-end="462.53">and I wanted to put my voice out there and so I did.</span> <span data-start="462.53" data-end="467.21">This is one of my very first personal sites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.21" data-end="472.689">My AIM name was BamAndPontiusChick because I really loved Jackass.</span> <span data-start="472.689" data-end="482.389">And I loved throwing things at crowd surfers and they would kick me in the head.</span> <span data-start="482.389" data-end="488.03">But this was the first place that I got to express myself and find other information</span> <span data-start="488.03" data-end="495.1">and dive into Allyssa explains, and find all the HTML help they're wanted.</span> <span data-start="495.1" data-end="501.259">There was people who were willing to just help people out with their link buttons.</span> <span data-start="501.259" data-end="508.759">And I eventually grew out of having a hostee site and I wanted my own domain name.</span> <span data-start="508.759" data-end="511.96">So I got this one, well, these two.</span> <span data-start="511.96" data-end="515.2">I finally convinced my parents to let me have some hosting.</span> <span data-start="515.2" data-end="518.909">It was probably one and one, or GoDaddy or something like that.</span> <span data-start="518.909" data-end="527.76">And then finally I was on my way, I got obsessed with grunge brushes, as you can see and I</span> <span data-start="527.76" data-end="531.94">had domain names where things I was inspired by my favorite lyrics.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="531.94" data-end="540.47">So a lot of the domain names were like screamo, or punk band stuff, or that's unlike M-83</span> <span data-start="540.47" data-end="542.18">and they're not punk.</span> <span data-start="542.18" data-end="550.339">It's like the scrollable divs, and the stat counts, which was the pre-Twitter thing of</span> <span data-start="550.339" data-end="554.69">how to count how popular you were.</span> <span data-start="554.69" data-end="563.55">And I was thinking the environment, and how good it felt to code through the process of</span> <span data-start="563.55" data-end="564.55">discovery.</span> <span data-start="564.55" data-end="571.149">And asking questions was encouraged and people really loved to help.</span> <span data-start="571.149" data-end="574.35">And I knew that I wasn't the only one.</span> <span data-start="574.35" data-end="579.13">So, of course, I do everyone does when they have an idea on the Internet, and I had decided</span> <span data-start="579.13" data-end="584.73">to write a medium think piece on it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="584.73" data-end="590.06">And I was like, hey, friends, did you have personal domains, or were you writing HTML</span> <span data-start="590.06" data-end="595">and CSS not for a job in the late '90s, early 2000s?</span> <span data-start="595" data-end="597.82">Talk to me about it!</span> <span data-start="597.82" data-end="599.329">And they totally did.</span> <span data-start="599.329" data-end="604.57">And I found a bunch of people had the same path as me, or a little bit different through</span> <span data-start="604.57" data-end="613.11">Myspace, Neopets, CSS for Lifejournal, age he will fire, Geocities, other people who</span> <span data-start="613.11" data-end="622.99">know the quality of a good paintbrush and put it was like, cool, all these people similar</span> <span data-start="622.99" data-end="624.55">to me did the same thing.</span> <span data-start="624.55" data-end="628.13">I wonder if they learned the same thing.</span> <span data-start="628.13" data-end="633.66">So I asked, were you doing HTML/CSS/JS in the early 2000s?</span> <span data-start="633.66" data-end="636.21">Where did you get your coding info from online?</span> <span data-start="636.21" data-end="639.23">For me, it was Allyssa Explains and DynamicDrive.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="639.23" data-end="651.57">And, again, the explanations were all over using CSS and a Zen Garden, Webmonkey, Allyssa</span> <span data-start="651.57" data-end="661.86">explained, DynamicDrive, and View Sore, and it was still exploratory and fun.</span> <span data-start="661.86" data-end="669.67">And it made me realize that, obviously, when communities are nice, more people want to</span> <span data-start="669.67" data-end="674.47">be a part of them and don't we all want our communities to be nice because we enjoy the</span> <span data-start="674.47" data-end="679.44">things that we make, hopefully and we want other people to contribute to that, too?</span> <span data-start="679.44" data-end="681.259">I would like to think so.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681.259" data-end="687.79">Which then led me to think, when did communities stop being nice?</span> <span data-start="687.79" data-end="694.05">And I found a certain trend in the areas that I thought it might have been.</span> <span data-start="694.05" data-end="701.54">And it was about 2007 and 2008 and it's something that happened, some websites that came out</span> <span data-start="701.54" data-end="704.35">then.</span> <span data-start="704.35" data-end="708.08">It's the gameification of knowledge sharing.</span> <span data-start="708.08" data-end="709.84">And it sucks.</span> <span data-start="709.84" data-end="715.05">Sure, it's helpful but people aren't necessarily being helpful because they care about you</span> <span data-start="715.05" data-end="719.8">and they want to help you; they're helping you because they want points.</span> <span data-start="719.8" data-end="723.589">Arbitrary point out on the Internet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="723.589" data-end="729.56">So I know that people make jQuery jokes a lot and there's nothing wrong with jQuery.</span> <span data-start="729.56" data-end="730.839">I've written a lot of it.</span> <span data-start="730.839" data-end="735.16">It's great for people that are learning but I think people that make these types of jokes,</span> <span data-start="735.16" data-end="739.71">myself included directly because of the gameification of sharing.</span> <span data-start="739.71" data-end="744.88">We're asking for vanilla JavaScript answers and we're getting jQuery answers not because</span> <span data-start="744.88" data-end="747.829">somebody cares about us, or wants to help us.</span> <span data-start="747.829" data-end="750.92">They just want to be heard.</span> <span data-start="750.92" data-end="757.302">And yeah, while the jQuery solves the problem, it doesn't solve my problem and while I think</span> <span data-start="757.302" data-end="761.839">this is a problem, we can fix it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="761.839" data-end="768.97">What I want is more ideas and more people is more knowledge sharing.</span> <span data-start="768.97" data-end="773.6">So yeah, people are getting involved in communities means more knowledge sharing but when you</span> <span data-start="773.6" data-end="780.13">add in the gamification, you're taking away the passion and I think that's pretty bad.</span> <span data-start="780.13" data-end="783.259">We need more ideas and less echo chambers.</span> <span data-start="783.259" data-end="789.36">We need more people sharing ideas freely and encouraging code exploration and less gate-keepered</span> <span data-start="789.36" data-end="792.73">echo chambers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="792.73" data-end="797.33">So now that we know why things could have maybe went so horrible.</span> <span data-start="797.33" data-end="805.279">Let's take a fun little stroll back between the Internet of then and the Internet of now.</span> <span data-start="805.279" data-end="812.05">So I'm going to give you some cool site how-toes for the early 2000s, starting with the coolest</span> <span data-start="812.05" data-end="816.31">techniques, slices and tables.</span> <span data-start="816.31" data-end="819.5">Has anybody made a website like this?</span> <span data-start="819.5" data-end="825.41">Is anybody happy that they never had to do this again?</span> <span data-start="825.41" data-end="829.519">So if you're not familiar, basically what you would do is your designer would lay out</span> <span data-start="829.519" data-end="832.67">your design in Photoshop.</span> <span data-start="832.67" data-end="835.459">Responsive design didn't exist, to it didn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="835.459" data-end="840.39">And then take this slice tool and draw out the sections that were important.</span> <span data-start="840.39" data-end="844.99">And you could even have a rollover for each of these sections.</span> <span data-start="844.99" data-end="852.351">Who needs CSS because we've got images and tables.</span> <span data-start="852.351" data-end="855.67">So there were a lot of sites that looked like this at the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="855.67" data-end="859.029">And thanks goodness most of that is over.</span> <span data-start="859.029" data-end="865.529">The other things that we did, which, obviously, this is my site with my cool haircut from</span> <span data-start="865.529" data-end="870.47">2003, lots of absolutely-positioned divs.</span> <span data-start="870.47" data-end="874.519">It didn't because, you know, we didn't care about responsive design then.</span> <span data-start="874.519" data-end="875.78">It wasn't really a thing.</span> <span data-start="875.78" data-end="880.55">So I could lay out this whole entire site and throw my grunge brushes all over it and</span> <span data-start="880.55" data-end="888.7">say, okay, cool, I know where this scrollable div should go, and xy (0, 0) makes sense because</span> <span data-start="888.7" data-end="899.449">who's going to maximize the div anyway?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="899.449" data-end="903.47">And a lot of people making websites that were personal, spent a lot of time making really</span> <span data-start="903.47" data-end="911.37">elaborate websites so you would still have that image techniques because obviously that</span> <span data-start="911.37" data-end="916.029">font over on the left side isn't any kind of web font in 2003.</span> <span data-start="916.029" data-end="918.069">But it was popular.</span> <span data-start="918.069" data-end="920.51">But luckily today is better.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="920.51" data-end="923.54">We have way more things.</span> <span data-start="923.54" data-end="930.43">We have way more things than back then with more people trying to get specs integrated</span> <span data-start="930.43" data-end="931.5">into browsers.</span> <span data-start="931.5" data-end="943.86">So if you're starting out, you can start with things like CSS Grid, Flexbox, Tachyons, because</span> <span data-start="943.86" data-end="947.29">it makes everything good without even having to try.</span> <span data-start="947.29" data-end="948.37">And Base CSS.</span> <span data-start="948.37" data-end="954.699">So now that we have the layouts covered, we're going to talk about some really cool fancy</span> <span data-start="954.699" data-end="956.139">things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="956.139" data-end="961.04">Fancy things like DHTML.</span> <span data-start="961.04" data-end="968.2">So the application of DHTML was actually introduced by Microsoft but I swear that's not like,</span> <span data-start="968.2" data-end="970.56">hey, I work there.</span> <span data-start="970.56" data-end="971.829">It's just a thing.</span> <span data-start="971.829" data-end="977.389">And if you have heard the term static site before, a static site is being just HTML and</span> <span data-start="977.389" data-end="981.35">CSS, you throw some JavaScript in there and it manipulates the DOM, guess what, you've</span> <span data-start="981.35" data-end="982.92">got DHTML.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="982.92" data-end="989.321">So difference basically a way for Microsoft with Internet Explorer 4 to be like, look</span> <span data-start="989.321" data-end="993.509">how fancy this is, it's so cool!</span> <span data-start="993.509" data-end="997.37">So you could do fancy things like cursor effects.</span> <span data-start="997.37" data-end="1004.86">So, so while you're mousing around on the browser, you have these plus signs, or ASCII</span> <span data-start="1004.86" data-end="1007.87">characters, or bubbles, or stars, or whatever.</span> <span data-start="1007.87" data-end="1011.6">Because you're cool, and you want people visiting on your site.</span> <span data-start="1011.6" data-end="1019.329">But the cool thing is, this is still on DynamicDrive and so you can go back and look at the old</span> <span data-start="1019.329" data-end="1023.18">code and I've put some new code over here.</span> <span data-start="1023.18" data-end="1030.23">You know, we're the last talk and I don't have all day to tell you about how we got</span> <span data-start="1030.23" data-end="1038.4">cool star effects but I do have an extremely cool demo from 2003.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1038.4" data-end="1044.25">I gotta find which way the browser is.</span> <span data-start="1044.25" data-end="1045.53">Cool.</span> <span data-start="1045.53" data-end="1046.53">All right.</span> <span data-start="1046.53" data-end="1047.84">New York City no.</span> <span data-start="1047.84" data-end="1049.86">One sec.</span> <span data-start="1049.86" data-end="1060.03">Very busy so here's a really nice one in case you want to make a site about a celebrity</span> <span data-start="1060.03" data-end="1064.37">that you have a crush on, and you want to let them how how much you want to kiss them.</span> <span data-start="1064.37" data-end="1067.65">You can put that cool kissing trail on there.</span> <span data-start="1067.65" data-end="1073.82">And here's another one, maybe it's winter and you want to celebrate the cold weather.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1073.82" data-end="1080.51">You're going to have maybe some snow falling and then, you know, maybe you are a really</span> <span data-start="1080.51" data-end="1084.87">big fan of scuba diving and you want bubbles on your site.</span> <span data-start="1084.87" data-end="1092.38">So you can do this and more with DHTML and DynamicDrive which was all just copy and paste</span> <span data-start="1092.38" data-end="1096.5">snippets and ridiculousness.</span> <span data-start="1096.5" data-end="1106.4">So you're in luck, too, because not only is today better for DHTML stuff, too, and we're</span> <span data-start="1106.4" data-end="1111.74">going to talk about why, literally everything is better than what you were able to do in</span> <span data-start="1111.74" data-end="1113.9">2001 and JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1113.9" data-end="1119.75">Everything that changes the DOM, 3JS is great.</span> <span data-start="1119.75" data-end="1123.94">P5, you can do VR in the browser now.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1142.88" data-end="1148.57">For the most part, the ways that we communicate has changed and we have a lot of work to do</span> <span data-start="1148.57" data-end="1154.44">to fix the damage that the gamification of knowledge has shaped some of our dev communities.</span> <span data-start="1154.44" data-end="1159.84">There's still the good people who are trying to help out and create a good community.</span> <span data-start="1159.84" data-end="1162.39">So support your communities.</span> <span data-start="1162.39" data-end="1166.68">Your local communities, global communities, other communities that you're not part of,</span> <span data-start="1166.68" data-end="1169.5">support them all.</span> <span data-start="1169.5" data-end="1174.02">When I started the journey of writing this talk from the Medium article, to being here</span> <span data-start="1174.02" data-end="1180.42">on this stage today, I realized something, and that's that never in my life have I felt</span> <span data-start="1180.42" data-end="1186.91">more supported than I did in the early 2000s as I do right now.</span> </p>
