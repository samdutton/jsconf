act and</span> <span data-start="605.27" data-end="606.86">then you have to practice these</span> <span data-start="606.86" data-end="609.62">strategies to reduce your bias that you</span> <span data-start="609.62" data-end="611.27">know what to do in that moment when you</span> <span data-start="611.27" data-end="613.43">recognize it and yes you do have to</span> <span data-start="613.43"

strategy I</span> <span data-start="618.29" data-end="620.9">want you to take a look at this picture</span> <span data-start="620.9" data-end="622.55">and think to yourself what is your first</span> <span data-start="622.55" data-end="624.5">reaction to it if I asked you to</span> <span data-start="624.5" data-end="626.15">describe who these people are and what</span> <span data-start="626.15" data-end="627.23">they were doing what would you think</span> <span data-start="627.23" data-end="630.14">what would you say did you assume that</span> <span data-start="630.14" data-end="632.03">each of these people are engineers or</span> <span data-start="632.03" data-end="634.55">designers beginners or experienced</span> <span data-start="634.55" data-end="637.31">straight or queer disabled or

data-start="642.47" data-end="644.93">and experienced interns and that's my</span> <span data-start="644.93" data-end="645.5">bias</span> <span data-start="645.5" data-end="647.57">so once you've acknowledged that your</span> <span data-start="647.57" data-end="649.7">own biases are informing the way you see</span> <span data-start="649.7" data-end="651.47">people you can choose to replace any</span> <span data-start="651.47" data-end="653.71">biased aspect of your thoughts or your</span> <span data-start="653.71" data-end="655.7">reaction with a different less</span> <span data-start="655.7" data-end="659.69">stereotypical scenario and this is what</span> <span data-start="659.69" data-end="662.15">we call breaking down the stereotype the</span> <span data-start="662.15" data-end="663.68">idea here is to consciously recognize</span> <span data-start="663.68" data-end="666.47">that I thought that you had came from a</span> <span data-start="666.47" data-end="668.27">stereotype and instead of leaving that</span> <span data-start="668.27" data-end="670.73">bias buried in your subconscious bring</span> <span data-start="670.73" data-end="672.84">it to the surface and then replace it</span> <span data-start="672.84" data-end="674.43">so in this case I can choose to</span> <span data-start="674.43" data-end="676.86">recognize my biased reaction and think</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.86" data-end="678.87">CEOs entrepreneurs</span> <span data-start="678.87" data-end="682.32">leaders experienced okay so let's move</span> <span data-start="682.32" data-end="684.18">on to our second strategy which is</span> <span data-start="684.18" data-end="686.49">increasing opportunities for contact and</span> <span data-start="686.49" data-end="688.5">it is probably one of the most important</span> <span data-start="688.5" data-end="691.29">strategies that you'll find because it</span> <span data-start="691.29" data-end="693.089">tends to help with all aspects of</span> <span data-start="693.089" data-end="695.31">breaking down our biases it can make us</span> <span data-start="695.31" data-end="697.02">confront our basic assumptions</span> <span data-start="697.02" data-end="699">it helps us empathize with individuals</span> <span data-start="699" data-end="700.71">who are different from us and it can</span> <span data-start="700.71" data-end="703.32">give us non-stereotypical x' that we can</span> <span data-start="703.32" data-end="705.779">continuously use to fight our own bias</span> <span data-start="705.779" data-end="709.41">and there's many ways to do this even if</span> <span data-start="709.41" data-end="711.72">you aren't a social butterfly so you can</span> <span data-start="711.72" data-end="713.37">try going to a diverse conference like</span> <span data-start="713.37" data-end="715.98">this one you could follow folks like the</span> <span data-start="715.98" data-end="717.69">other amazing speakers that you've heard</span> <span data-start="717.69" data-end="720.33">on Twitter you can contribute to an open</span> <span data-start="720.33"

data-end="726.12">find a mentor for yourself whatever</span> <span data-start="726.12" data-end="727.83">feels like a good step for you that's</span> <span data-start="727.83" data-end="729.839">enough and I'm not going to lie</span> <span data-start="729.839" data-end="732.27">increasing opportunities for contact can</span> <span data-start="732.27" data-end="734.76">be scary sometimes too so if you</span> <span data-start="734.76" data-end="736.5">struggle with this like I tend to do</span> <span data-start="736.5" data-end="738.75">it's always a good move to listen and be</span> <span data-start="738.75" data-end="741.36">genuinely curious Twitter and blogs can</span> <span data-start="741.36" data-end="743.22">be an awesome start because you can</span> <span data-start="743.22" data-end="744.96">follow along and get a sense of what</span> <span data-start="744.96" data-end="746.46">someone might or might not want to talk</span> <span data-start="746.46" data-end="749.4">about it also helps to be open to</span> <span data-start="749.4" data-end="751.5">hearing things you didn't expect reading</span> <span data-start="751.5" data-end="753.81">body

data-end="801.42">bias become habits themselves and it</span> <span data-start="801.42" data-end="803.1">will feel easier to quash unconscious</span> <span data-start="803.1" data-end="803.87">bias when it</span> <span data-start="803.87" data-end="806.48">sup again so let's shift away from our</span> <span data-start="806.48" data-end="808.22">internal struggles and dive into how we</span> <span data-start="808.22" data-end="810.17">can respond to bias in our environments</span> <span data-start="810.17" data-end="811.79">we've been working with an amazing</span> <span

charged than</span> <span data-start="831.14" data-end="833.45">others but still useful for practicing</span> <span data-start="833.45" data-end="836.27">these techniques so who's heard this

data-start="842.93" data-end="844.88">thought it one or two times to remember</span> <span data-start="844.88" data-end="846.98">that we are all biased and we can even</span> <span data-start="846.98"
