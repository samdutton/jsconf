data-start="550.42" data-end="551.8">it actually looks like so we can see</span> <span data-start="551.8" data-end="554.259">it's very clear what the title is right</span> <span data-start="554.259" data-end="555.91">that grabs my attention immediately</span> <span data-start="555.91" data-end="557.35">they have keywords at the top so I can</span> <span data-start="557.35" data-end="559.6">look at the keywords and see okay am i</span> <span data-start="559.6" data-end="561.899">interested in this is this worth my time</span> <span data-start="561.899" data-end="564.339">they pull out the first paragraph and</span> <span data-start="564.339" data-end="566.05">make it bigger they have sub heads so</span> <span data-start="566.05" data-end="568.18">maybe I see okay I know a little bit</span> <span data-start="568.18" data-end="569.98">about people scanning websites but maybe</span> <span data-start="569.98" data-end="571.089">there's something new in here that I</span> <span data-start="571.089" data-end="572.439">don't know about so I'm gonna skim</span> <span data-start="572.439" data-end="574.089">through the sub heads see if one catches</span> <span data-start="574.089" data-end="575.649">my eye oh I didn't know about you know</span> <span data-start="575.649" data-end="576.939">this new study let me read that</span> <span data-start="576.939" data-end="581.379">paragraph all right keep decoration to a</span> <span data-start="581.379" data-end="584.649">minimum so this is something that I</span> <span data-start="584.649" data-end="587.889">think is is it's more attempting to not</span> <span data-start="587.889" data-end="589.839">do this as there are so many different</span> <span data-start="589.839" data-end="591.009">you know like google fonts or so many</span> <span data-start="591.009" data-end="593.189">different free typefaces that we can use</span> <span data-start="593.189" data-end="596.5">and it's it's easy especially for like</span> <span data-start="596.5" data-end="597.699">clients that we work with to be like oh</span> <span data-start="597.699" data-end="599.439">we want like six different typefaces</span> <span data-start="599.439" data-end="604.449">no not gonna do that and here's why we</span> <span data-start="604.449" data-end="606.009">usually pick like two or three so maybe</span> <span data-start="606.009" data-end="608.019">we have one typeface that's dedicated to</span> <span data-start="608.019" data-end="609.55">our headers and sub headers and one</span> <span data-start="609.55" data-end="612.66">that's for body text color is again so</span> <span data-start="612.66" data-end="615.519">two to three and the reason for this is</span> <span data-start="615.519" data-end="618.04">because when you have too many typefaces</span> <span data-start="618.04" data-end="620.019">or too many colors our brain</span> <span data-start="620.019" data-end="621.819">instinctively assumes that it's an ad</span> <span data-start="621.819" data-end="624.069">and we just completely skip that we</span> <span data-start="624.069" data-end="626.11">don't even look at that content we just</span> <span data-start="626.11" data-end="629.5">skip it completely so again kind of</span> <span data-start="629.5" data-end="631.269">using more complex fonts or typefaces</span> <span data-start="631.269" data-end="632.62">for the headers where the text is</span> <span data-start="632.62" data-end="634.12">probably bigger and then your simpler</span> <span data-start="634.12" data-end="635.589">ones for the body text which is probably</span> <span data-start="635.589" data-end="638.949">going to be a little bit smaller so I'm</span> <span data-start="638.949" data-end="641.23">not making fun of this website and</span> <span data-start="641.23" data-end="642.37">actually felt much better</span> <span data-start="642.37" data-end="644.23">about using this example in this</span> <span data-start="644.23" data-end="645.699">presentation because I saw that they</span> <span data-start="645.699" data-end="647.92">redesigned it and it's much better now</span> <span data-start="647.92" data-end="649.75">but this is what it used to look like</span> <span data-start="649.75" data-end="653.35">and when I look at that site right first</span> <span data-start="653.35" data-end="654.43">of all I don't know where to go because</span> <span data-start="654.43" data-end="655.809">there's a lot of different elements that</span> <span data-start="655.809" data-end="657.91">are competing for my attention the nav</span> <span data-start="657.91" data-end="659.92">isn't kind of an unusual spot that's not</span> <span data-start="659.92" data-end="661.809">where I would instinctively go to look</span> <span data-start="661.809" data-end="664.689">for navigation I assumed that all of</span> <span data-start="664.689" data-end="666.129">those squares at the bottom were ads</span> <span data-start="666.129" data-end="667">because they all have different</span> <span data-start="667" data-end="668.649">typefaces the colors are all different</span> <span data-start="668.649" data-end="670.899">font sizes all different and those are</span> <span data-start="670.899" data-end="672.73">actually just like pages on this site</span> <span data-start="672.73" data-end="675.63">there like programs that the church has</span> <span data-start="675.63" data-end="676.72">so</span> <span data-start="676.72" data-end="678.37">this is a better example like every time</span> <span data-start="678.37" data-end="679.629">that I go to this slide I just kind of</span> <span data-start="679.629" data-end="684.129">like yes this is just nice it's very</span> <span data-start="684.129" data-end="685.93">clear the navigation is where I expect</span> <span data-start="685.93" data-end="688.05">it to be it's clear what page I'm on I</span> <span data-start="688.05" data-end="690.879">know what pattern I know at a glance</span> <span data-start="690.879" data-end="693.189">what pattern this site is using to</span> <span data-start="693.189" data-end="694.93">disseminate information and a big thing</span> <span data-start="694.93" data-end="696.85">that I'm going to talk about is how you</span> <span data-start="696.85" data-end="698.29">want to make people learn one pattern</span> <span data-start="698.29" data-end="700.66">and stick to it right we want to make</span> <span data-start="700.66" data-end="702.67">using our application or website as</span> <span data-start="702.67" data-end="707.05">painless as possible okay we recap quick</span> <span data-start="707.05" data-end="708.91">so we want to think about speech as a</span> <span data-start="708.91" data-end="711.16">visual element within a website or</span> <span data-start="711.16" data-end="712.389">application so give it plenty of</span> <span data-start="712.389" data-end="714.16">breathing room make sure it's legible</span> <span data-start="714.16" data-end="716.379">make it scannable so that people can</span> <span data-start="716.379" data-end="717.73">skip around to what they're interested</span> <span data-start="717.73" data-end="719.8">in and keep it simple not so many colors</span> <span data-start="719.8" data-end="722.519">or too many typefaces alright</span> <span data-start="722.519" data-end="725.55">we want to use our images appropriately</span> <span data-start="725.55" data-end="727.569">and early I don't think there's any</span> <span data-start="727.569" data-end="729.129">situation where this image is not</span> <span data-start="729.129" data-end="733">appropriate but that's another</span> <span data-start="733" data-end="737.709">conversation so icons a company that's</span> <span data-start="737.709" data-end="739.48">actually called user testing which is a</span> <span data-start="739.48" data-end="742.059">little too on the nose but they studied</span> <span data-start="742.059" data-end="745.209">190 icons in 2015 and they asked people</span> <span data-start="745.209" data-end="747.279">what they asked people to predict what</span> <span data-start="747.279" data-end="748.569">would happen when they clicked on a</span> <span data-start="748.569" data-end="751.149">particular icon so they found that if</span> <span data-start="751.149" data-end="753.519">they gave them icons that were unique to</span> <span data-start="753.519" data-end="755.199">an application so for example Twitter</span> <span data-start="755.199" data-end="756.67">has the little like feather thing that</span> <span data-start="756.67" data-end="757.98">you click if you want to write a message</span> <span data-start="757.98" data-end="760.449">that one everybody knows but exempt you</span> <span data-start="760.449" data-end="761.949">know icons like that that are unique to</span> <span data-start="761.949" data-end="763.809">a specific application if they did have</span> <span data-start="763.809" data-end="767.529">a label only 34% of people knew what it</span> <span data-start="767.529" data-end="769.87">was going to do so that's like a third</span> <span data-start="769.87" data-end="771.819">of people so 66 or some people guess</span> <span data-start="771.819" data-end="774.73">wrong if they use more generic Universal</span> <span data-start="774.73" data-end="777.67">icons again without a label 60 percent</span> <span data-start="777.67" data-end="779.74">of people guess what it was going to do</span> <span data-start="779.74" data-end="781.509">correctly and if they put a label on</span> <span data-start="781.509" data-end="783.43">those more generic icons than 80 percent</span> <span data-start="783.43" data-end="785.259">of people got it right but that's still</span> <span data-start="785.259" data-end="789.1">you know one-fifth people didn't know it</span> <span data-start="789.1" data-end="790.329">was going to happen when they click that</span> <span data-start="790.329" data-end="793.12">icon so the idea is kind of there are</span> <span data-start="793.12" data-end="797.8">maybe three like truly Universal icons</span> <span data-start="797.8" data-end="800.5">it just doesn't exist and especially if</span> <span data-start="800.5" data-end="802.059">you have an application that is used by</span> <span data-start="802.059" data-end="804.25">an international audience I mean you</span> <span data-start="804.25" data-end="805.6">just you cannot assume that people know</span> <span data-start="805.6" data-end="810.419">what something is going to do</span> <span data-start="810.429" data-end="812.079">so yeah labels are the rule not the</span> <span data-start="812.079" data-end="814.209">exception they work best often in a</span> <span data-start="814.209" data-end="815.919">navigation or a menu setting that's kind</span> <span data-start="815.919" data-end="817.509">of again where we expect them as well or</span> <span data-start="817.509" data-end="820.329">if they're if you use them for</span> <span data-start="820.329" data-end="822.309">decoration not as part of the actual</span> <span data-start="822.309" data-end="823.839">like functionality and then avoiding</span> <span data-start="823.839" data-end="826.149">icons with conflicting meanings so I</span> <span data-start="826.149" data-end="827.979">want everyone to think what icon would</span> <span data-start="827.979" data-end="830.949">you choose to mean share just give</span> <span data-start="830.949" data-end="834.999">people a second okay these are all icons</span> <span data-start="834.999" data-end="836.619">that have been used in software to mean</span> <span data-start="836.619" data-end="839.139">sure they all look completely different</span> <span data-start="839.139" data-end="841.089">from each other some of them I really</span> <span data-start="841.089" data-end="843.999">don't understand why they went that</span> <span data-start="843.999" data-end="845.349">particular route but that just kind of</span> <span data-start="845.349" data-end="846.879">goes to show right there there really</span> <span data-start="846.879" data-end="849.729">are very few Universal icons and you</span> <span data-start="849.729" data-end="850.779">know some people have come up to me</span> <span data-start="850.779" data-end="851.919">after this talking like well what if we</span> <span data-start="851.919" data-end="853.359">put hover text on it well hover text</span> <span data-start="853.359" data-end="856.419">doesn't work on mobile for one and also</span> <span data-start="856.419" data-end="858.669">that is creating extra work for the user</span> <span data-start="858.669" data-end="860.409">right we want to make it easy for people</span> <span data-start="860.409" data-end="862.689">to interact with our content so if I</span> <span data-start="862.689" data-end="865.449">have to admit if I have to put invisible</span> <span data-start="865.449" data-end="868.509">work into understanding how something</span> <span data-start="868.509"

data-end="885.909">couple people okay so this is back in</span> <span data-start="885.909" data-end="887.919">the days when I was building my Buffy</span> <span data-start="887.919" data-end="890.769">the Vampire Slayer website and pretty</span> <span data-start="890.769" data-end="893.669">much all sites had that like flashing</span> <span data-start="893.669" data-end="896.829">rectangular ad right at the top if you</span> <span data-start="896.829" data-end="899.169">remember that that was so ubiquitous</span> <span data-start="899.169" data-end="901.539">that we started to instinctively ignore</span> <span data-start="901.539" data-end="903.039">that section and we'll see that again in</span> <span data-start="903.039"

data-end="914.019">this this banner blindness people have</span> <span data-start="914.019" data-end="915.669">started to put their ads elsewhere right</span> <span data-start="915.669" data-end="916.809">so how many times when you're reading</span> <span data-start="916.809" data-end="919.659">through like a news article and then it</span> <span data-start="919.659" data-end="921.399">says like content continues after the ad</span> <span data-start="921.399" data-end="922.569">and there's just an ad right in the</span> <span data-start="922.569"

data-end="928.149">skip that too you know I find that I</span> <span data-start="928.149" data-end="929.949">notice what that is and I just don't</span> <span data-start="929.949" data-end="931.239">even look at it I just skip down to the</span> <span data-start="931.239" data-end="934.539">rest of the text so we we adjust for the</span> <span data-start="934.539"

there's</span> <span data-start="1297.49" data-end="1300.04">this sort of broad F shape so we start</span> <span data-start="1300.04" data-end="1303.49">in the top I don't know left and right</span> <span data-start="1303.49" data-end="1306.64">left corner and then we kind of cascade</span> <span data-start="1306.64" data-end="1308.77">down and again you can see that the</span> <span

data-end="1359.26">and that same behavior right human</span> <span data-start="1359.26" data-end="1360.97">behavior does not change we just ported</span> <span data-start="1360.97" data-end="1363.1">that behavior over to the web but</span> <span data-start="1363.1" data-end="1364.87">instead of a fold we have a scroll so</span> <span data-start="1364.87" data-end="1366.67">it's kind of like before the scroll so</span> <span data-start="1366.67" data-end="1368.95">100 see 6 percent more people look at</span> <span data-start="1368.95" data-end="1374.2">the content before the

really</span> <span data-start="1376.75" data-end="1379.12">getting our our key concepts at the top</span> <span data-start="1379.12" data-end="1381.01">of the page and then avoid putting</span> <span
