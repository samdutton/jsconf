<p><span data-start="10.5" data-end="16.5">I'm Daniel Ehrenberg and I work in TC39 and I came here to tell you about bigint</span> <span data-start="16.56" data-end="17.97">Let's talk about numbers.</span> <span data-start="17.97" data-end="23.119">Math.pow(2, 53) is a function that can take a number to a particular power.</span> <span data-start="23.119" data-end="25.75">X will be to the 53rd power.</span> <span data-start="25.75" data-end="29.98">You can write two to **53.</span> <span data-start="29.98" data-end="31.66">What does that equal?</span> <span data-start="31.66" data-end="33.86">Starting with a nine and ending with a two.</span> <span data-start="33.86" data-end="37.13">What do you get if you add one to that?</span> <span data-start="37.13" data-end="39.43">Two to the 53 plus one.</span> <span data-start="39.43" data-end="40.43">The same number back.</span> <span data-start="40.43" data-end="46.02">A huge number, nine end, a two before what is going on?</span> <span data-start="46.02" data-end="53.28">In this talk, I will tell you about why numbers do this, how we can fix this using BigInt,</span> <span data-start="53.28" data-end="58.33">and how TC39 has been developing BigInt in partnership with the JavaScript community,</span> <span data-start="58.33" data-end="62.83">and how you can get involved to shape the next version of JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="62.83" data-end="65.689">I really want your help in all of this.</span> <span data-start="65.689" data-end="67.89">We can't do it without you.</span> <span data-start="67.89" data-end="75.24">So, first about numbers: numbers in JavaScript are 64-bit floats, floating point, binary,</span> <span data-start="75.24" data-end="76.25">numbers.</span> <span data-start="76.25" data-end="79.729">So that is basically like scientific notation.</span> <span data-start="79.729" data-end="86.479">Remember, from grade school, 30,000, you could represent as 3 times ten to the five?</span> <span data-start="86.479" data-end="88.88">Here, the component would be 5.</span> <span data-start="88.88" data-end="93.4">The sine is positive 1 and the fraction is 3.</span> <span data-start="93.4" data-end="99.481">I triple e — it's base two instead of base ten.</span> <span data-start="99.481" data-end="106.819">We have the sign that is one bit, and the component which is 11 bit, and the fraction,</span> <span data-start="106.819" data-end="109.389">52 bits.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.389" data-end="117.299">So, our friend 2 to the 53rd power looks like this when you put it in a floating point.</span> <span data-start="117.299" data-end="120.009">Sine is zero to represent positive 1.</span> <span data-start="120.009" data-end="124.939">Component is that number starting with a 1, and the fraction is all zeros.</span> <span data-start="124.939" data-end="128.78">It has an implicit 1-point before the zeroes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="128.78" data-end="132.319">The next biggest number is that ending with a four.</span> <span data-start="132.319" data-end="138.83">If you look at the last digit, the last digit of this number ending a 2 is 0, and the one</span> <span data-start="138.83" data-end="140.23">being 1 is 1.</span> <span data-start="140.23" data-end="142.51">There are actually no numbers in between.</span> <span data-start="142.51" data-end="146.61">When I say "number", I mean the binary floating point numbers.</span> <span data-start="146.61" data-end="152.24">Ultimately, if we are representing something in 64 bits, there is only 2 to the 64 different</span> <span data-start="152.24" data-end="157.25">bit pattern, so we can't represent every single actual number that exists in the world, or</span> <span data-start="157.25" data-end="158.26">every single integer.</span> <span data-start="158.26" data-end="164.4">At some point, we have to round or go up to infinity or have an error.</span> <span data-start="164.4" data-end="166.9">This seems like a random case.</span> <span data-start="166.9" data-end="170.2">This never comes up in practice.</span> <span data-start="170.2" data-end="177.05">It turns out it president in Twitter's API, there's an ID field, tweets represented by</span> <span data-start="177.05" data-end="181.849">good afternoon, objects, and the idea that you get over the network looks like this,</span> <span data-start="181.849" data-end="186">this big number ending in 888.</span> <span data-start="186" data-end="192.61">When you parse that in JavaScript, it gets converted to a number.</span> <span data-start="192.61" data-end="197.57">So, the 8, 888 rounds to 900.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="197.57" data-end="205.48">For this reason, Twitter includes a secondary field, ID string, which is a string of the</span> <span data-start="205.48" data-end="210.8">number, and that doesn't round, but people run into this as a problem all the tile.</span> <span data-start="210.8" data-end="216.36">Like it's kind of easier to use the ID rather than the ID stream, and it's hard for Twitter</span> <span data-start="216.36" data-end="218.28">to remove it because of compatibility.</span> <span data-start="218.28" data-end="223.43">Sometimes, the numbers don't overflow, like in that second line in this bug, but other</span> <span data-start="223.43" data-end="228.4">times, they do, and you just are referring to the wrong object.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.4" data-end="232.909">Another case this comes up is inode numbers.</span> <span data-start="232.909" data-end="239.29">Each file is generally associated with a number, a pointer to the file.</span> <span data-start="239.29" data-end="246.079">Node.js includes an API called stat to read the inode numbers on a file.</span> <span data-start="246.079" data-end="251.099">On Linux, inode numbers are often kind of low, but on Windows, they can be high and</span> <span data-start="251.099" data-end="253.68">run into the same kind of rounding issue.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.68" data-end="259.73">So this L stat sync, there's a reproducible test case where you can create a couple of</span> <span data-start="259.73" data-end="265.18">files in that folder which have inode numbers which one of them ending in 27 but then it</span> <span data-start="265.18" data-end="272.58">rounds up to  the same 28.</span> <span data-start="272.58" data-end="276.96">If you try to parse those numbers back to the system again, it is not going to work.</span> <span data-start="276.96" data-end="280.66">It is the wrong number.</span> <span data-start="280.66" data-end="291.38">To get around these kinds of problems, there are libraries created which gives you an object</span> <span data-start="291.38" data-end="298.39">API for this where you can instantiate a new big num and call methods on it to add or things</span> <span data-start="298.39" data-end="299.39">like that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="299.39" data-end="305.949">There are some limitations here, because it's not integrated into the system, so, if you</span> <span data-start="305.949" data-end="311.09">have something else in the standard library, or in the web platform or node, it's not obvious</span> <span data-start="311.09" data-end="312.55">how to integrate with this.</span> <span data-start="312.55" data-end="320.34">It's not optimisable so the JavaScript engine can't use knowledge of mathematics to make</span> <span data-start="320.34" data-end="321.34">it faster.</span> <span data-start="321.34" data-end="327.15">It is an extra thing to download and integrate which is difficult in some projects.</span> <span data-start="327.15" data-end="330.419">So, what if we had this in JavaScript itself?</span> <span data-start="330.419" data-end="335.75">Going back to the original example, where we add one and we get the same number back</span> <span data-start="335.75" data-end="343.45">again, what if we could indicate that we want to refer just to integers using a sufficient</span> <span data-start="343.45" data-end="344.45">if I can like n?</span> <span data-start="344.45" data-end="347.58">2n to the 53n would be the same number starting with a 9 and ending with a 2, but when you</span> <span data-start="347.58" data-end="351.43">add 1 into it, you get 3 at the end.</span> <span data-start="351.43" data-end="354.29">N here, the 2 goes to 3.</span> <span data-start="354.29" data-end="357.99">N here stands for BigInt.</span> <span data-start="357.99" data-end="359.539">Is this JavaScript?</span> <span data-start="359.539" data-end="360.949">It is.</span> </p>
