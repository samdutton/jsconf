data-end="202.79">building that are really confusing</span> <span data-start="202.79" data-end="204.44">because you had to say well this this</span> <span data-start="204.44" data-end="206.12">part

people</span> <span data-start="216.02" data-end="217.25">distributed that in line of</span> <span data-start="217.25" data-end="218.48">distributions which is pretty amazing</span> <span data-start="218.48" data-end="220.64">like it's so Harvard still people maybe</span> <span data-start="220.64" data-end="223.16">effort so that was exciting and then</span> <span data-start="223.16"

do everything</span> <span data-start="242.36" data-end="245.87">with nodejs so I got this thing it's a</span> <span data-start="245.87" data-end="249.5">cuny harbor controller which is for</span> <span data-start="249.5" data-end="252.89">hackers um it's good pressure sensitive</span> <span data-start="252.89" data-end="254.989">part with le lives you can't really say</span> <span data-start="254.989" data-end="256.91">that because it's really right but there</span> <span data-start="256.91" data-end="263.02">are ladies here and it's a small oops um</span> <span data-start="263.02" data-end="267.29">the nice thing is that it uses GDP</span> <span data-start="267.29" data-end="269.93">either you've heard about GDP but it's</span> <span data-start="269.93" data-end="272.06">like a obviously you're fair about d I</span> <span data-start="272.06" data-end="274.37">mean obviously Oh opens how control it's</span> <span data-start="274.37" data-end="275.48">like a protocol you can use for</span> <span data-start="275.48" data-end="278.75">connecting between different instruments</span> <span data-start="278.75" data-end="279.89">and controllers everything it's like</span> <span data-start="279.89" data-end="283.729">maybe but modern like the will be big</span> <span data-start="283.729" data-end="288.229">brother of of midi so this thing comes</span> <span data-start="288.229" data-end="289.91">with something called oh you see Bree</span> <span data-start="289.91" data-end="292.22">which converts your USB data into</span> <span data-start="292.22" data-end="295.01">something that Oh any other internet</span> <span data-start="295.01" data-end="298.15">award program like nose candy chest um</span> <span data-start="298.15" data-end="301.43">so with a knife module that someone</span> <span data-start="301.43" data-end="303.05">already have made I could just read</span> <span data-start="303.05" data-end="305.51">whatever these things sends me and I can</span> <span data-start="305.51" data-end="307.04">also send things to that so for example</span> <span data-start="307.04" data-end="310.94">if I fabrice here it's just listening</span> <span data-start="310.94" data-end="312.68">the touch events i'm sending some just</span> <span data-start="312.68" data-end="315.2">getting messages here and then i can</span> <span data-start="315.2" data-end="317.51">also send messages here so i can control</span> <span data-start="317.51" data-end="318.92">the colors that you can't really see</span> <span data-start="318.92" data-end="321.8">again because it's very bright and then</span> <span data-start="321.8" data-end="323.81">that's for the input but what do we do</span> <span data-start="323.81" data-end="325.88">in in the browser because we want to</span> <span data-start="325.88" data-end="329.62">make it sound so so can you that's</span> <span data-start="329.62" data-end="334.16">evident um and then the way this works</span> <span data-start="334.16" data-end="337.7">is with open side control you kind of</span> <span data-start="337.7" data-end="343.55">subscribe to addresses it's like silence</span> <span data-start="343.55" data-end="348.29">it's like like URLs you can match things</span> <span data-start="348.29" data-end="350.42">with Richard recruit regular expressions</span> <span data-start="350.42" data-end="351.62">like these things so for example when I</span> <span data-start="351.62" data-end="354.5">press about I get sent a message with</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="357.29">data structure and again say I'm</span> <span data-start="357.29" data-end="358.94">interested only in present parts I'm</span> <span data-start="358.94" data-end="360.41">just describing to that I'm filtering</span> <span data-start="360.41" data-end="362.15">everything else and with socket i/o I'm</span> <span data-start="362.15" data-end="364.43">sending everything through from UDP to</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="367.22">this thing to the browser and just</span> <span data-start="367.22" data-end="368.99">listen to whatever i'm interested in and</span> <span data-start="368.99" data-end="372.23">then i can send messages again you can</span> <span data-start="372.23" data-end="374.51">see that but each part has like four</span> <span data-start="374.51" data-end="376.31">leds and i can control the red and the</span> <span data-start="376.31" data-end="378.5">green values so again i can turn the</span> <span data-start="378.5" data-end="380.48">whole thing red hold clean green or</span> <span data-start="380.48" data-end="384.95">somewhere in between and then that's for</span> <span data-start="384.95" data-end="388.07">the pub obviously had to do something</span> <span data-start="388.07" data-end="392">that might sound so previously i used to</span> <span data-start="392" data-end="395.81">build my old thing like total ignoring</span> <span data-start="395.81" data-end="399.83">all the opposition's using the script</span> <span data-start="399.83" data-end="401.78">notes I was like everything like it was</span> <span data-start="401.78" data-end="403.669">like if it was a still c++ but then i</span> <span data-start="403.669" data-end="405.56">thought that could do this with proper</span> <span data-start="405.56" data-end="408.98">web audio using only api from the audio</span> <span data-start="408.98" data-end="412.22">and make it very modular like i can</span> <span data-start="412.22" data-end="413.99">include one things and the other and</span> <span data-start="413.99" data-end="417.59">reuse as much as possible so the problem</span> <span data-start="417.59" data-end="418.91">with that is that the</span> <span data-start="418.91" data-end="421.49">very very native where all your stuff is</span> <span data-start="421.49" data-end="423.41">very very native and it's very very</span> <span data-start="423.41" data-end="425.84">limited so you had to write lots of</span> <span data-start="425.84" data-end="429.14">rubbers and for example the oscillators</span> <span data-start="429.14" data-end="431.93">when whatever our bow is just stops</span> <span data-start="431.93" data-end="434.57">playing it just disappears into the user</span> <span data-start="434.57" data-end="436.58">so you need to make something so that</span> <span data-start="436.58" data-end="438.08">you can detect okay this node has</span> <span data-start="438.08" data-end="440.69">finished you need to regenerate that so</span> <span data-start="440.69" data-end="442.76">you need to go making lots of little</span> <span data-start="442.76" data-end="443.93">things like that they are not very</span> <span data-start="443.93" data-end="446.27">difficult but they are not as intuitive</span> <span data-start="446.27" data-end="449.33">and they seem to be finding people by</span> <span data-start="449.33" data-end="452.15">surprise a lot and another thing that I</span> <span data-start="452.15" data-end="453.35">think it's interesting is I made a</span> <span data-start="453.35" data-end="455.72">little envelope I don't know if you know</span> <span data-start="455.72" data-end="458.96">about the envelopes it's basically if</span> <span data-start="458.96" data-end="461.75">you got an instrument and you pay always</span> <span data-start="461.75" data-end="464.05">in the same volume it's boring it's like</span> <span data-start="464.05" data-end="466.67">you need to give a little for expression</span> <span data-start="466.67" data-end="469.01">the way of doing that is having volume</span> <span data-start="469.01" data-end="470.3">changes so you can do love with</span> <span data-start="470.3" data-end="471.74">envelopes and develop is basically</span> <span data-start="471.74" data-end="474.77">attack decay sustain release so I build</span> <span data-start="474.77" data-end="477.47">that which kind of automates the way you</span> <span data-start="477.47" data-end="479.18">can change parameters we will audio</span> <span data-start="479.18" data-end="480.86">which is something like setvalue time</span> <span data-start="480.86" data-end="483.5">set parameter time that's given motor</span> <span data-start="483.5" data-end="485.63">blood all the time so you just automate</span> <span data-start="485.63" data-end="489.86">that with a class so that was for the</span> <span data-start="489.86" data-end="491.99">basic things but sometimes there were</span> <span data-start="491.99" data-end="494.3">times I didn't have enough things like</span> <span data-start="494.3" data-end="496.37">for example I wanted to multiply the</span> <span data-start="496.37" data-end="498.47">output of two nodes but I don't think</span> <span data-start="498.47" data-end="500.6">there's anything we roll it up that's it</span> <span data-start="500.6" data-end="503.69">so you can just shame it with a custom</span> <span data-start="503.69" data-end="507.38">node which is pretty good and obviously</span> <span data-start="507.38" data-end="510.22">you want to change things I'm a degree</span> <span data-start="510.22" data-end="515.719">and this is this is using this is</span> <span data-start="515.719" data-end="522.74">attached to whatever I created so it's</span> <span data-start="522.74" data-end="525.11">based on web component I don't know</span> <span data-start="525.11" data-end="527.48">about that thing so if it's very low</span> <span data-start="527.48" data-end="529.61">it's fine if it's not exactly shame</span> <span data-start="529.61" data-end="531.11">everything away and I just don't worry</span> <span data-start="531.11" data-end="533.87">about that so the way worse i create</span> <span data-start="533.87" data-end="535.73">instances with that and then i attach</span> <span data-start="535.73" data-end="538.07">them to real virtual instruments I</span> <span data-start="538.07" data-end="541.58">creative because has even faced whether</span> <span data-start="541.58" data-end="547.61">i do in the degree just reflect on the</span> <span data-start="547.61" data-end="549.44">instruments so i could be changed</span> <span data-start="549.44" data-end="550.73">the relief time and he should be</span> <span data-start="550.73" data-end="555.59">changing so it's longer release or sure</span> <span data-start="555.59" data-end="558.11">do so and if you change that</span> <span data-start="558.11" data-end="559.55">programmatically it would changes as</span> <span data-start="559.55" data-end="561.44">well but and I'm not going to life</span> <span data-start="561.44" data-end="567.29">program here so the first thing I wrote</span> <span data-start="567.29" data-end="569.84">was the bajo drone which is a funny Kim</span> <span data-start="569.84" data-end="572.51">howarth with the Spanish and English so</span> <span data-start="572.51" data-end="574.64">it's like based on and some more funny</span> <span data-start="574.64" data-end="577.07">multi voice in you unisonic bus lane so</span> <span data-start="577.07" data-end="579.22">it makes that it only plays one note</span> <span data-start="579.22" data-end="581.24">multi voices because it's got more than</span> <span data-start="581.24" data-end="583.1">one see later and unisonic is because</span> <span data-start="583.1" data-end="584.69">there are playing in different octaves</span> <span data-start="584.69" data-end="588.53">and its baseline so this
