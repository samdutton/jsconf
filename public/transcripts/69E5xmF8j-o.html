data-end="838.87">do this to use this library to expose</span> <span data-start="838.87" data-end="841.12">some variables so you can track their</span> <span data-start="841.12"

data-end="851.98">developed by on managing logs so to</span> <span data-start="851.98" data-end="854.949">display logs in real time just to PM to</span> <span data-start="854.949" data-end="856.87">logs and you will see like all the logs</span> <span data-start="856.87" data-end="858.67">in real time you can declare the name of</span> <span data-start="858.67"

data-start="881.5" data-end="887.079">now organizing applications so if you</span> <span data-start="887.079" data-end="888.579">build your application in the micro</span> <span data-start="888.579" data-end="891.009">service where you split your monolithic</span> <span data-start="891.009" data-end="893.56">application into small services it can</span> <span data-start="893.56"
