<p><span data-start="228.72" data-end="230.7">I don't want to think that you have to</span> <span data-start="230.7" data-end="232.38">have a PhD to build certain things or</span> <span data-start="232.38" data-end="234.54">you have to be backed by Google or</span> <span data-start="234.54" data-end="237.06">Facebook I believe that everything that</span> <span data-start="237.06" data-end="238.53">we see we might not understand at first</span> <span data-start="238.53" data-end="241.26">there is a kind of cheap hockey version</span> <span data-start="241.26" data-end="244.019">that we can do at home without having to</span> <span data-start="244.019" data-end="245.549">think that you have to work for Google</span> <span data-start="245.549" data-end="248.519">for to do stuff like that so now we</span> <span data-start="248.519" data-end="249.989">let's talk quickly about the potential</span> <span data-start="249.989" data-end="252.69">of textile so first of all it's flexible</span> <span data-start="252.69" data-end="254.519">when we think about our laptop or our</span> <span data-start="254.519" data-end="256.56">phone is quite rigid if you try to bend</span> <span data-start="256.56" data-end="258.06">it well it's going to break but with</span> <span data-start="258.06" data-end="260.13">textile when you embed electronics in it</span> <span data-start="260.13" data-end="261.93">you actually can well it's quite</span> <span data-start="261.93" data-end="263.88">flexible so you won't you have less</span> <span data-start="263.88" data-end="266.94">chances of breaking it easily</span> <span data-start="266.94" data-end="268.29">very lightweight most of the time we</span> <span data-start="268.29" data-end="269.55">don't even realize that we're wearing</span> <span data-start="269.55" data-end="271.11">clothes by the way it textile doesn't</span> <span data-start="271.11" data-end="272.64">have to be clothes it could be this</span> <span data-start="272.64" data-end="274.74">textile on the table here you have</span> <span data-start="274.74" data-end="276.57">curtains at home or towels or blankets</span> <span data-start="276.57" data-end="279.48">or pillows or whatever it's in the end</span> <span data-start="279.48" data-end="281.34">we don't really look at it that way we</span> <span data-start="281.34" data-end="282.84">kind of just take it as well it's</span> <span data-start="282.84" data-end="284.52">textile it just covers our body but it's</span> <span data-start="284.52" data-end="286.47">actually a lot of potential there as</span> <span data-start="286.47" data-end="288.36">well and it for it being lightweight it</span> <span data-start="288.36" data-end="291.36">means that we would maybe be able to</span> <span data-start="291.36" data-end="292.71">kind of walk around without having to</span> <span data-start="292.71" data-end="295.08">carry a heavy phone or a heavy laptop I</span> <span data-start="295.08" data-end="297.12">started speaking at conferences last</span> <span data-start="297.12" data-end="299.28">year and even if I try to travel light</span> <span data-start="299.28" data-end="301.62">at the end my luggage is or my backpack</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="303.18">is actually quite heavy because of the</span> <span data-start="303.18" data-end="305.13">laptop and the phone and stuff like that</span> <span data-start="305.13" data-end="307.2">so being able to embed that kind of</span> <span data-start="307.2" data-end="309.27">interactions into textile means that we</span> <span data-start="309.27" data-end="312.03">could actually travel even a lot lighter</span> <span data-start="312.03" data-end="314.52">it is quite modular so if you want to</span> <span data-start="314.52" data-end="316.14">build your own things you can add</span> <span data-start="316.14" data-end="317.34">different components you could add</span> <span data-start="317.34" data-end="319.83">lights or flex sensors or all that stuff</span> <span data-start="319.83" data-end="322.02">and you get to build it yourself so you</span> <span data-start="322.02" data-end="324.15">rather you get to decide where you want</span> <span data-start="324.15" data-end="325.8">it to be if even if it was on a t-shirt</span> <span data-start="325.8" data-end="327.36">it could be the shoulders or the back or</span> <span data-start="327.36" data-end="329.49">whatever so you don't have to actually</span> <span data-start="329.49" data-end="331.83">buy something as it is like the phone</span> <span data-start="331.83" data-end="333.36">you know I mean well Google I think was</span> <span data-start="333.36" data-end="334.77">working on a modular phone but in</span> <span data-start="334.77" data-end="337.14">general when you buy a piece of tech</span> <span data-start="337.14" data-end="338.97">it's kind of like you know you just buy</span> <span data-start="338.97" data-end="339.99">it and that's the way it is and you</span> <span data-start="339.99" data-end="341.43">don't get to decide what parts you want</span> <span data-start="341.43" data-end="343.56">but by building your own textile</span> <span data-start="343.56" data-end="345.24">interfaces you get to decide the</span> <span data-start="345.24" data-end="346.68">interaction and the sensors that you</span> <span data-start="346.68" data-end="349.8">want to embed in it it's responsive to</span> <span data-start="349.8" data-end="352.26">adaptive touch so this is in this talk I</span> <span data-start="352.26" data-end="353.73">kind of had to made up make up some</span> <span data-start="353.73" data-end="356.73">words because so adaptive touch is well</span> <span data-start="356.73" data-end="357.9">that I made up because I didn't really</span> <span data-start="357.9" data-end="359.31">know how to explain what I wanted to say</span> <span data-start="359.31" data-end="362.04">so adaptive touch what I mean Dada is</span> <span data-start="362.04" data-end="365.31">that so when you for example for the</span> <span data-start="365.31" data-end="369.39">jacket by Google you interact with it</span> <span data-start="369.39" data-end="371.4">and it sends a signal but adaptive touch</span> <span data-start="371.4" data-end="372.75">means that you don't have to press it</span> <span data-start="372.75" data-end="374.52">very hard to then send a signal you can</span> <span data-start="374.52" data-end="376.23">even just slightly touch it and you</span> <span data-start="376.23" data-end="377.43">could have different interactions based</span> <span data-start="377.43" data-end="379.98">on how you decide to touch the jacket so</span> <span data-start="379.98" data-end="382.47">this is what I mean by adaptive touch it</span> <span data-start="382.47" data-end="384.69">is very low-power if you've been playing</span> <span data-start="384.69" data-end="386.22">a bit with Arduino or Raspberry Pi</span> <span data-start="386.22" data-end="388.05">depending on the amount of components</span> <span data-start="388.05" data-end="389.94">that you have in your circuit it's not</span> <span data-start="389.94" data-end="391.169">something that you'll have to recharge</span> <span data-start="391.169" data-end="392.49">every day like you do with your phone</span> <span data-start="392.49" data-end="395.25">and then finally it's pretty cheap so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.25" data-end="397.05">I'll cover that a bit later as well but</span> <span data-start="397.05" data-end="398.8">if you compare the price of</span> <span data-start="398.8" data-end="401.08">a Macbook — something that you can do</span> <span data-start="401.08" data-end="402.49">well obviously you will do a lot less</span> <span data-start="402.49" data-end="403.96">with interactive test I'll let you do</span> <span data-start="403.96" data-end="406.539">with your laptop but it's to get started</span> <span data-start="406.539" data-end="409.33">in that space you don't have to spend a</span> <span data-start="409.33" data-end="412.24">lot of money okay so how does it</span> <span data-start="412.24" data-end="414.33">actually work at the core of it is</span> <span data-start="414.33" data-end="417.46">conductive thread so this is normal</span> <span data-start="417.46" data-end="419.11">thread that it makes that is mixed with</span> <span data-start="419.11" data-end="421.12">stainless steel so it means that it</span> <span data-start="421.12" data-end="422.86">carries the current through a circuit</span> <span data-start="422.86" data-end="427">the same way that Y is do so again well</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427" data-end="427.9">I don't know if you've been playing with</span> <span data-start="427.9" data-end="430.27">Arduino but usually you connect your</span> <span data-start="430.27" data-end="432.009">microcontroller and your sensors with</span> <span data-start="432.009" data-end="434.349">wires in between and you can do exactly</span> <span data-start="434.349" data-end="437.44">the same with conductive thread the main</span> <span data-start="437.44" data-end="439.15">difference though is that usually wires</span> <span data-start="439.15" data-end="441.46">are coated like they're wrapped into</span> <span data-start="441.46" data-end="442.599">some kind of plastic so you don't really</span> <span

data-end="448.15">body conducts electricity as well it</span> <span data-start="448.15" data-end="450.55">means that when you use conductive</span> <span data-start="450.55" data-end="453.159">thread

<p><span data-start="968.44" data-end="969.76">Google did but you could really do</span> <span data-start="969.76" data-end="972.1">anything with it you could turn it into</span> <span

little bit</span> <span data-start="989.08" data-end="993.39">quickly into how how many it happen so</span> <span data-start="993.39" data-end="997.12">instead of just sewing threads just like</span> <span data-start="997.12" data-end="999.52">horizontally just like separately I</span> <span data-start="999.52" data-end="1002.12">turned them into a matrix so agreed and</span> <span data-start="1002.12" data-end="1004.32">one thing that is really important is</span> <span data-start="1004.32" data-end="1007.05">that the thread should not touch so when</span> <span data-start="1007.05" data-end="1008.82">a piece of thread goes over the fabric</span> <span data-start="1008.82" data-end="1011.52">the one that is on the y-axis should</span> <span data-start="1011.52" data-end="1013.98">actually go under the reason for that is</span> <span data-start="1013.98" data-end="1016.08">because if you're touching one piece of</span> <span data-start="1016.08" data-end="1017.82">thread and that piece of thread touches</span> <span data-start="1017.82" data-end="1019.32">another piece of piece of thread then</span> <span data-start="1019.32" data-end="1022.44">your reading is going to be wrong so I</span> <span data-start="1022.44" data-end="1024.66">do edit it in terms of a matrix because</span> <span data-start="1024.66" data-end="1026.04">all of a sudden your threads can be</span> <span data-start="1026.04" data-end="1028.589">changed into coordinates obviously you</span> <span data-start="1028.589" data-end="1030.48">want to be mapping where you're touching</span> <span data-start="1030.48" data-end="1032.1">the thread to a location on the screen</span> <span data-start="1032.1" data-end="1035.01">so your vertical threads could be X 0 X</span> <span data-start="1035.01" data-end="1038.25">1 X 2 and then y 0 y 1 y 2 for this</span> <span data-start="1038.25" data-end="1040.439">particular example I only used six</span> <span data-start="1040.439" data-end="1042.449">pieces of threads but you could see that</span> <span data-start="1042.449" data-end="1044.37">because I did it manually and there</span> <span data-start="1044.37" data-end="1045.78">already took me a while so if I had a</span> <span data-start="1045.78" data-end="1047.939">swing machine I could actually do a lot</span> <span data-start="1047.939" data-end="1050.67">bigger and better stuff but what is</span> <span data-start="1050.67" data-end="1052.11">going on after that is that when you're</span> <span data-start="1052.11" data-end="1054.95">touching for example the top left corner</span> <span data-start="1054.95" data-end="1057.66">you get data so you could be like okay I</span> <span data-start="1057.66" data-end="1060.9">get a value from my first thread my</span> <span data-start="1060.9" data-end="1062.31">first vertical thread I get a value from</span> <span data-start="1062.31" data-end="1064.83">my first horizontal thread so I could be</span> <span data-start="1064.83" data-end="1065.72">that the</span> <span data-start="1065.72" data-end="1068.69">is then x0 and y0 and then with</span> <span data-start="1068.69" data-end="1070.52">coordinates you could you could add that</span> <span data-start="1070.52" data-end="1072.26">to canvas in the browser and stuff like</span> <span data-start="1072.26" data-end="1074.87">that so for example that as I showed</span> <span data-start="1074.87" data-end="1077.33">here as I'm touching the middle thread</span> <span data-start="1077.33" data-end="1080.39">and the bottom thread like vertically</span> <span data-start="1080.39" data-end="1083.27">presently I apply that to then my</span> <span data-start="1083.27" data-end="1088.52">visualization in the browser yes and</span> <span data-start="1088.52" data-end="1090.23">then you could actually also have that's</span> <span data-start="1090.23" data-end="1091.94">the second made-up turn temporal</span> <span data-start="1091.94" data-end="1093.5">gestures it's not lip smart I was I</span> <span data-start="1093.5" data-end="1095.12">don't know how to call it so but if it</span> <span data-start="1095.12" data-end="1096.95">sounds madam I'll take it</span> <span data-start="1096.95" data-end="1100.58">so here when I showed you the demo I was</span> <span data-start="1100.58" data-end="1102.44">just touching one at a time and it was</span> <span data-start="1102.44" data-end="1104.87">impacting the visualization but you</span> <span data-start="1104.87" data-end="1107.27">could assert you could program swipes</span> <span data-start="1107.27" data-end="1109.61">like I said before and the way you would</span> <span data-start="1109.61" data-end="1112.19">do that is you would track data that you</span> <span data-start="1112.19" data-end="1114.83">get over time for example over half a</span> <span data-start="1114.83" data-end="1117.08">second or over a second you would push</span> <span data-start="1117.08" data-end="1119">everything into an array and then every</span> <span data-start="1119" data-end="1120.919">second or every half a second you would</span> <span data-start="1120.919" data-end="1122.78">check okay if the first value in my</span> <span data-start="1122.78" data-end="1126.74">array was X 0 Y 2 and then the last</span> <span data-start="1126.74" data-end="1128.809">would be X 2 y 2 then it means I'm</span> <span data-start="1128.809" data-end="1131">swiping right and you know the opposite</span> <span data-start="1131" data-end="1132.53">for swiping left you could do up and</span> <span data-start="1132.53" data-end="1134.299">down and things like that so then you</span> <span data-start="1134.299" data-end="1136.82">could create a lot of different gestures</span> <span data-start="1136.82" data-end="1138.02">that would mean different things so even</span> <span data-start="1138.02" data-end="1140.299">with only six pieces of threads you</span> <span data-start="1140.299" data-end="1141.559">could actually have quite a lot of</span> <span data-start="1141.559" data-end="1143">different ways to interact with an</span> <span data-start="1143" data-end="1146.27">interface and okay this is not me but I</span> <span data-start="1146.27" data-end="1148.94">wish it was me and that uses the same</span> <span data-start="1148.94" data-end="1150.71">principle so but it's a lot it's not</span> <span data-start="1150.71" data-end="1152.6">done by hand you can see that it uses a</span> <span data-start="1152.6" data-end="1155.33">machine and the reading is really really</span> <span data-start="1155.33" data-end="1157.669">good so it is a great agreed as well and</span> <span data-start="1157.669" data-end="1160.88">the where you're touching on an X and Y</span> <span data-start="1160.88" data-end="1163.669">axis is then showed by lighting up</span> <span data-start="1163.669" data-end="1166.34">certain squares on the screen so I put</span> <span data-start="1166.34" data-end="1169.1">the link to the blog where there's like</span> <span data-start="1169.1" data-end="1170.809">a lot of different other interactions</span> <span data-start="1170.809" data-end="1172.13">that you can do a six style so you can</span> <span data-start="1172.13" data-end="1173.84">check that afterwards but ultimately</span> <span data-start="1173.84" data-end="1175.7">that's kind of what I would like to be</span> <span data-start="1175.7" data-end="1178.49">building because it's also like a super</span> <span data-start="1178.49" data-end="1180.62">lightweight and it's like on your skin</span> <span data-start="1180.62" data-end="1182.27">so you could really just interact with</span> <span data-start="1182.27" data-end="1183.74">interfaces with that so that's really</span> <span data-start="1183.74" data-end="1186.53">cool different a few different</span> <span data-start="1186.53" data-end="1188.059">applications this is where I wish the</span> <span data-start="1188.059" data-end="1190.059">videos were working but okay so</span> <span data-start="1190.059" data-end="1192.71">accessories so as I one of my prototype</span> <span data-start="1192.71"

data-end="1332.279">actually have your phone in your pocket</span> <span data-start="1332.279" data-end="1332.88">and you</span> <span data-start="1332.88" data-end="1334.77">by doing it putting your hand a bit</span> <span data-start="1334.77" data-end="1336.45">closer just trigger things and if you</span> <span data-start="1336.45" data-end="1338.73">have a piece of thread on all of your</span> <span data-start="1338.73" data-end="1340.62">fingers you could really map so and just</span> <span data-start="1340.62" data-end="1343.98">use quite quite nicely and and it's</span> <span data-start="1343.98" data-end="1345.75">really cool that you don't have you</span> <span data-start="1345.75" data-end="1347.13">don't have to have a PhD to do things</span> <span data-start="1347.13" data-end="1349.74">like this like I was I'm quite convinced</span> <span data-start="1349.74" data-end="1351.03">that I could figure out how to do this</span> <span data-start="1351.03" data-end="1352.56">it's gonna take me probably a bit more</span> <span data-start="1352.56" data-end="1354.06">time but I was googling yesterday like</span> <span data-start="1354.06" data-end="1355.68">how to calculate the magnitude of</span> <span data-start="1355.68" data-end="1357.3">magnetic fields and I was like oh my god</span> <span data-start="1357.3" data-end="1359.07">you know it's so cool I didn't figure it</span> <span data-start="1359.07" data-end="1360.93">out yet I need to find the formula but</span> <span data-start="1360.93" data-end="1364.17">you have a web you have the sensor API</span> <span data-start="1364.17" data-end="1365.58">in the browser that allows you to have</span> <span data-start="1365.58" data-end="1367.56">access to stuff from the magnetometer</span> <span data-start="1367.56" data-end="1369.75">and your phone it just doesn't it just</span> <span data-start="1369.75" data-end="1371.22">doesn't give you the magnitude so you</span> <span data-start="1371.22" data-end="1373.68">have to calculate yourself so maybe I</span> <span data-start="1373.68" data-end="1374.82">will come back one day and I would have</span> <span data-start="1374.82" data-end="1378.27">figured it out then of course you know</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1378.27" data-end="1379.92">I've been talking about the</span> <span data-start="1379.92" data-end="1381.48">possibilities and how excited I am about</span> <span data-start="1381.48" data-end="1383.73">this but there are limits so I have to</span> <span data-start="1383.73" data-end="1385.98">mention that as well it is partially</span> <span data-start="1385.98" data-end="1387.51">waterproof we're talking about textile</span> <span data-start="1387.51" data-end="1389.22">so obviously you know if you wear</span> <span data-start="1389.22" data-end="1390.99">something on a jacket and it rains you</span> <span data-start="1390.99" data-end="1393.69">have to be a bit careful but you you can</span> <span data-start="1393.69" data-end="1395.07">add a certain coating so there's a spray</span> <span data-start="1395.07" data-end="1397.14">that you can add on conductive thread to</span> <span data-start="1397.14" data-end="1399.81">make it waterproof a connective thread</span> <span data-start="1399.81" data-end="1402.51">works for two years maximum so I think</span> <span data-start="1402.51" data-end="1404.91">it works like well for two years and</span> <span data-start="1404.91" data-end="1406.17">then like that it doesn't work anymore</span> <span data-start="1406.17" data-end="1407.58">all of a sudden but it means that the</span> <span data-start="1407.58" data-end="1410.36">reading might change over time and</span> <span data-start="1410.36" data-end="1412.26">finally quite interesting the</span> <span data-start="1412.26" data-end="1413.73">capacitance changes with external</span> <span data-start="1413.73" data-end="1415.89">factors and that will impact the way</span> <span data-start="1415.89" data-end="1416.97">that you're going to code that will</span> <span data-start="1416.97" data-end="1419.1">impact the threshold but what it means</span> <span data-start="1419.1" data-end="1420.72">is that depending on the weather if it's</span> <span data-start="1420.72" data-end="1422.7">humid or dry the reading that you're</span> <span data-start="1422.7" data-end="1424.38">gonna get the capacitance is going to be</span> <span data-start="1424.38" data-end="1426.72">different so your threshold you know</span> <span data-start="1426.72" data-end="1428.4">mine was a thousand but if it was like a</span> <span data-start="1428.4" data-end="1429.54">dry winter day it might have been</span> <span data-start="1429.54" data-end="1431.58">different so depending on what you</span> <span data-start="1431.58" data-end="1432.99">actually want to build if it's a jacket</span> <span data-start="1432.99" data-end="1434.25">that goes outside you'll have to take</span> <span data-start="1434.25" data-end="1436.53">that into consideration if you have like</span> <span data-start="1436.53" data-end="1438.45">a couch at home while you will be less</span> <span data-start="1438.45" data-end="1439.86">affected by external factors so it</span> <span data-start="1439.86" data-end="1442.14">should be all right but yeah so that's</span> <span data-start="1442.14" data-end="1444.12">to me that's the main limits that I</span> <span data-start="1444.12" data-end="1446.46">found also if you want to do this I</span> <span data-start="1446.46" data-end="1447.54">would not advise to do it by hand</span> <span data-start="1447.54" data-end="1449.07">because sometimes it takes hours to just</span> <span data-start="1449.07" data-end="1450.48">put stuff together and that was very</span> <span data-start="1450.48" data-end="1454.94">frustrating for me and a few extras so I</span> <span data-start="1454.94" data-end="1456.99">made most of my experiments with</span> <span data-start="1456.99" data-end="1458.49">conductive thread but it's not the only</span> <span data-start="1458.49" data-end="1460.89">material that you can use so there's</span> <span data-start="1460.89" data-end="1462.27">actually quite a lot you can use</span> <span data-start="1462.27" data-end="1464.37">conductive rubber stretches sensors so</span> <span data-start="1464.37" data-end="1465.57">you can</span> <span data-start="1465.57" data-end="1467.43">detect how the rice conducted but also</span> <span data-start="1467.43" data-end="1468.93">how much you stretchy so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="1468.93" data-end="1470.16">cool I don't know what I would do with</span> <span data-start="1470.16" data-end="1472.8">it but that's nice the second one is a</span> <span data-start="1472.8" data-end="1474.9">piece of conductive fabric so instead of</span> <span data-start="1474.9" data-end="1477.66">just having the thread you could</span> <span data-start="1477.66" data-end="1479.46">actually cover a bigger area of textile</span> <span data-start="1479.46" data-end="1481.44">by cutting fabric into different shapes</span> <span data-start="1481.44" data-end="1484.47">or or just cover or have an entire shirt</span> <span data-start="1484.47" data-end="1486.21">that's conductive instead of just a you</span> <span data-start="1486.21" data-end="1487.56">know piece of it</span> <span data-start="1487.56" data-end="1489.48">you have pressure-sensitive conductive</span> <span data-start="1489.48" data-end="1492.33">sheet where instead of just having the</span> <span data-start="1492.33" data-end="1493.65">connectivity you could have the pressure</span> <span data-start="1493.65" data-end="1495.81">how much you're pressing on the sheet as</span> <span data-start="1495.81" data-end="1498.3">well and then finally you have stretch</span> <span data-start="1498.3" data-end="1501.33">resistive fabric where you can read the</span> <span data-start="1501.33" data-end="1503.78">amount of stretch by by stretching it</span> <span data-start="1503.78" data-end="1506.79">and the what that would allow you to do</span> <span data-start="1506.79" data-end="1508.5">as well is to play with something that I</span> <span data-start="1508.5" data-end="1509.19">really want to do</span> <span data-start="1509.19" data-end="1511.17">that's called electrical to typography</span> <span data-start="1511.17" data-end="1513.78">where instead of just so it's about</span> <span data-start="1513.78" data-end="1516.03">finding coordinates as well but for me</span> <span data-start="1516.03" data-end="1517.68">to find coordinates and map them to a</span> <span data-start="1517.68" data-end="1520.05">screen I made a grid of thread and I</span> <span data-start="1520.05" data-end="1521.91">converted that into coordinates but if</span> <span data-start="1521.91" data-end="1525.39">you have a sheet of fabric there is</span> <span data-start="1525.39" data-end="1527.52">actually a way to try and find</span> <span data-start="1527.52" data-end="1529.83">ultimately where you're touching it by</span> <span data-start="1529.83" data-end="1531.66">doing electrical topography so you're</span> <span data-start="1531.66" data-end="1534.12">adding sensors all around the sheet and</span> <span data-start="1534.12" data-end="1535.23">they're going to give you a certain</span> <span data-start="1535.23" data-end="1537.57">value of capacitance and as your body</span> <span data-start="1537.57" data-end="1539.82">touches the conductive sheet it's gonna</span> <span data-start="1539.82" data-end="1541.95">it's gonna change the electric charge</span> <span data-start="1541.95" data-end="1544.41">and by reading the data coming in all</span> <span data-start="1544.41" data-end="1546.57">sensors you can approximately know how</span> <span data-start="1546.57" data-end="1548.67">close you are to certain senses rather</span> <span data-start="1548.67" data-end="1551.31">than others and what I really like about</span> <span data-start="1551.31" data-end="1553.26">that is that it's not something that I</span> <span data-start="1553.26" data-end="1555.39">thought JavaScript devs would be able to</span> <span data-start="1555.39" data-end="1557.16">do like usually just build websites but</span> <span data-start="1557.16" data-end="1559.32">now I know that by just going with a bit</span> <span data-start="1559.32" data-end="1561.78">of hardware you can actually come up you</span> <span data-start="1561.78" data-end="1563.49">this probably there's probably a formula</span> <span data-start="1563.49" data-end="1565.29">to actually calculate this I just need</span> <span data-start="1565.29" data-end="1567.87">to buy the sensors and then figure stuff</span> <span data-start="1567.87" data-end="1569.85">out and and just play with stuff like</span> <span data-start="1569.85" data-end="1572.01">this which i think is really cool and</span> <span data-start="1572.01" data-end="1574.89">then finally before I finish some final</span> <span data-start="1574.89" data-end="1576.9">words of wisdom that are not by me by</span> <span data-start="1576.9" data-end="1579.33">never entertain imagination is more</span> <span data-start="1579.33" data-end="1581.04">important than knowledge for knowledge</span> <span data-start="1581.04" data-end="1582.87">is limited to all we now know and</span> <span data-start="1582.87" data-end="1585.18">understand while imagination embraces</span> <span data-start="1585.18" data-end="1587.37">the entire world and or there ever will</span> <span data-start="1587.37" data-end="1589.89">be to know and understand and I read</span> <span data-start="1589.89" data-end="1591.81">this quote while I was reading a really</span> <span data-start="1591.81" data-end="1593.97">short essay called the usefulness of</span> <span data-start="1593.97" data-end="1597.78">useless knowledge and what I really like</span> <span data-start="1597.78" data-end="1599.34">you don't have to believe me</span> <span data-start="1599.34" data-end="1600.54">you when I say that this is really</span> <span data-start="1600.54" data-end="1602.16">interesting and important to look into</span> <span data-start="1602.16" data-end="1602.46">this</span> <span data-start="1602.46" data-end="1604.53">but if Einstein says that it's important</span> <span data-start="1604.53" data-end="1605.67">then you know you kind of have to</span> <span data-start="1605.67" data-end="1607.92">believe it but the reason why I'm saying</span> <span data-start="1607.92" data-end="1609.75">that is because I feel like sometimes as</span> <span data-start="1609.75" data-end="1612.45">developers we're not really using our</span> <span data-start="1612.45" data-end="1615.72">full potential in what we can build I</span> <span data-start="1615.72" data-end="1617.61">think we might we might forget that a</span> <span data-start="1617.61" data-end="1619.38">lot of people who are not devs have to</span> <span data-start="1619.38" data-end="1621.27">just take the world as it is and just</span> <span data-start="1621.27" data-end="1622.77">buy the stuff that other people have</span> <span data-start="1622.77" data-end="1624">built without really having the chance</span> <span data-start="1624" data-end="1626.31">to make it more personal or you can</span> <span data-start="1626.31" data-end="1628.02">imagine but you can't build where as</span> <span data-start="1628.02" data-end="1629.91">developers even just JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1629.91" data-end="1631.74">developers it doesn't you don't need to</span> <span data-start="1631.74" data-end="1634.05">to like have like a master's degree or</span> <span data-start="1634.05" data-end="1636.06">know all the languages in the world it's</span> <span data-start="1636.06" data-end="1638.19">just about being

it and I</span> <span data-start="1642.09" data-end="1643.62">feel like that's that's extremely</span> <span data-start="1643.62" data-end="1644.97">powerful we don't know what kind of</span> <span
