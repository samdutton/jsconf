<p><span data-start="8.3" data-end="11.16">yeah I am going to talk a little bit</span> <span data-start="11.16" data-end="13.74">about the thing that sits here and my</span> <span data-start="13.74" data-end="15.99">own software and stuff but like I said</span> <span data-start="15.99" data-end="18.869">this morning I've been asked to do</span> <span data-start="18.869" data-end="21.869">something different I'm I'm not the best</span> <span data-start="21.869" data-end="24.6">human beatbox in the world as you can</span> <span data-start="24.6" data-end="26.25">imagine otherwise I wouldn't be a</span> <span data-start="26.25" data-end="29.369">software developer anymore because human</span> <span data-start="29.369" data-end="32.489">beatboxing is just so much more fun but</span> <span data-start="32.489" data-end="36.51">if you're interested in how this works</span> <span data-start="36.51" data-end="38.879">and what you can do yourself you can</span> <span data-start="38.879" data-end="40.89">follow along so this is going to be like</span> <span data-start="40.89" data-end="44.879">a very simple explanation I'm going to</span> <span data-start="44.879" data-end="46.98">show three fundamental sounds of human</span> <span data-start="46.98" data-end="49.649">beatboxing the first one is the bass</span> <span data-start="49.649" data-end="57.6">drum it goes a little bit like this this</span> <span data-start="57.6" data-end="60.21">is not it could be louder but that's</span> <span data-start="60.21" data-end="63.059">probably fine and if you want to follow</span> <span data-start="63.059" data-end="65.729">along and you want to try this yourself</span> <span data-start="65.729" data-end="67.159">you should probably stand up because</span> <span data-start="67.159" data-end="69.78">it's it's kind of hard to beat barks</span> <span data-start="69.78" data-end="73.29">while sitting so if you want to you want</span> <span data-start="73.29" data-end="78.299">to do that nice and so there are there</span> <span data-start="78.299" data-end="81.75">few fundamental ways how you can do a</span> <span data-start="81.75" data-end="84.81">bass drum and it's basically two</span> <span data-start="84.81" data-end="88.47">different types of yeah sounds you can</span> <span data-start="88.47" data-end="91.85">make the first one is a little bit like</span> <span data-start="91.85" data-end="99.27">try that and it sounds unimpressive but</span> <span data-start="99.27" data-end="100.32">that's because you don't have a</span> <span data-start="100.32" data-end="101.939">microphone like a lot of human</span> <span data-start="101.939" data-end="104.31">beatboxing relies on the fact that you</span> <span data-start="104.31" data-end="105.479">have a microphone and the microphone</span> <span data-start="105.479" data-end="109.02">responds in a specific way to the sound</span> <span data-start="109.02" data-end="111.54">waves that your lips make and it sounds</span> <span data-start="111.54" data-end="116.09">dull like that sounds like nothing but</span> <span data-start="116.09" data-end="118.979">if you have a microphone it will sound</span> <span data-start="118.979" data-end="121.02">more impressive and the other one is</span> <span data-start="121.02" data-end="123.06">actually a D so you could do something</span> <span data-start="123.06" data-end="133.449">like</span> <span data-start="133.459" data-end="136.98">and at some point at some point you need</span> <span data-start="136.98" data-end="138.569">to start breathing and then things go</span> <span data-start="138.569" data-end="141">wrong that's that's totally normal for</span> <span data-start="141" data-end="143.97">beginners as well the next one is a</span> <span data-start="143.97" data-end="148.739">snare clap rimshot kind of thing and the</span> <span data-start="148.739" data-end="153.09">original human beatbox people mostly did</span> <span data-start="153.09" data-end="161.76">like like and it's like and it sounds a</span> <span data-start="161.76" data-end="164.37">little bit like a synthesized snare of</span> <span data-start="164.37" data-end="171.329">sorts and yeah try that again now the</span> <span data-start="171.329" data-end="173.069">interesting thing is if you get into the</span> <span data-start="173.069" data-end="175.86">breathing rhythm thing you actually need</span> <span data-start="175.86" data-end="177.959">to learn how to do this backwards so by</span> <span data-start="177.959" data-end="180.599">not pushing out air but to breathe air</span> <span data-start="180.599" data-end="182.76">in and this is I I'm not really good at</span> <span data-start="182.76" data-end="184.59">this so you don't need to try this</span> <span data-start="184.59" data-end="186.78">because it's hard it goes a little</span> <span data-start="186.78" data-end="189.729">something like this</span> <span data-start="189.739" data-end="193.56">and I'm breathing in ear air while I'm</span> <span data-start="193.56" data-end="195.81">doing that so it helps with a breathing</span> <span data-start="195.81" data-end="202.38">rhythm now the second one is a a clap is</span> <span data-start="202.38" data-end="205.17">really hard to to do with a mouth it's</span> <span data-start="205.17" data-end="208.94">easier to just clap and that's and</span> <span data-start="208.94" data-end="212.43">that's because a clap is usually a</span> <span data-start="212.43" data-end="214.44">couple of impulses that come like in</span> <span data-start="214.44" data-end="216.75">random order like if you if you see how</span> <span data-start="216.75" data-end="219.72">drum synthesizes synthesize collapses</span> <span data-start="219.72" data-end="222.06">it's relatively complicated and so what</span> <span data-start="222.06" data-end="224.43">you can do is a rimshot which is the</span> <span data-start="224.43" data-end="227.31">sound when the drummer hits the rim of</span> <span data-start="227.31" data-end="230.28">the snare drum so the outer rim and a</span> <span data-start="230.28" data-end="232.709">and it it's a it's a very harsh sounds</span> <span data-start="232.709" data-end="237.87">look like and it's really just and and</span> <span data-start="237.87" data-end="245.7">that one you can also do backwards and</span> <span data-start="245.7" data-end="248.4">now we have two sounds and that's</span> <span data-start="248.4" data-end="252.569">already something right and the last one</span> <span data-start="252.569" data-end="256.229">is the high hat cymbal and that's really</span> <span data-start="256.229" data-end="261.869">easy it's really just</span> <span data-start="261.879" data-end="267.68">yeah that sounds right so if you want to</span> <span data-start="267.68" data-end="271.06">turn this into a simple rhythm there's a</span> <span data-start="271.06" data-end="274.25">really nice like a really nice way to</span> <span data-start="274.25" data-end="287.27">say which is just and like I said I</span> <span data-start="287.27" data-end="290.629">really suck at this so here's a couple</span> <span data-start="290.629" data-end="293.21">of names to Google of people who can do</span> <span

data-start="1230.27" data-end="1233.99">as you will note it's kind of weird</span> <span data-start="1233.99" data-end="1235.91">because we have we seem to have four</span> <span data-start="1235.91"

show you</span> <span data-start="1257.32" data-end="1260.57">like there's no hole in it so</span> <span data-start="1260.57" data-end="1263.2">transparency doesn't make any sense</span> <span data-start="1263.2" data-end="1270.23">anyway well okay so we have an</span> <span data-start="1270.23" data-end="1272.33">interesting setup where we actually can</span> <span data-start="1272.33" data-end="1275.12">use web technologies to generate the</span> <span data-start="1275.12" data-end="1277.46">display data but now we have to send it</span> <span data-start="1277.46"

data-end="1389.22">wanted to talk a little bit more about</span> <span data-start="1389.22" data-end="1395.07">this so why this is a great question I</span> <span data-start="1395.07" data-end="1398.4">mean first of all because I can that's</span> <span data-start="1398.4" data-end="1401.61">always a good thing because learning I</span> <span data-start="1401.61" data-end="1404.039">really wanted to figure out this display</span> <span data-start="1404.039" data-end="1405.87">thing and I also really wanted to figure</span> <span data-start="1405.87" data-end="1408.9">out how can I build an instrument that</span> <span data-start="1408.9" data-end="1412.049">works for myself because that's kind of</span> <span data-start="1412.049" data-end="1414.39">the important part it's I built my own</span> <span data-start="1414.39" data-end="1417.39">instrument I can do whatever I want with</span> <span data-start="1417.39" data-end="1419.549">it it's not something where I need to</span> <span data-start="1419.549" data-end="1422.1">wait for like a new update to a certain</span> <span data-start="1422.1"

data-end="1434.309">if it would do this thing and I didn't</span> <span data-start="1434.309" data-end="1436.26">just implement it</span> <span data-start="1436.26" data-end="1438.45">and this actually does make a huge</span> <span data-start="1438.45" data-end="1442.08">difference and also I just needed to</span> <span data-start="1442.08" data-end="1443.73">build something for life Jess otherwise</span> <span data-start="1443.73" data-end="1448.38">it would be pointless yeah and I would</span> <span data-start="1448.38" data-end="1451.47">like to if I will show you a little demo</span> <span data-start="1451.47" data-end="1453.78">of what this thing can do and I would</span> <span data-start="1453.78" data-end="1457.8">like to close with this quote who in</span> <span
