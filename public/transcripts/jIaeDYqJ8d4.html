<p><span data-start="108.04" data-end="110.48">MapReduce again and our language scares</span> <span data-start="110.48" data-end="111.58">and blah</span> <span data-start="111.58" data-end="114.7">and he keeps on talking until he finally</span> <span data-start="114.7" data-end="118.95">has to breathe and yeah so I was</span> <span data-start="118.95" data-end="121.36">presented with his lung sentence about a</span> <span data-start="121.36" data-end="124">couch TV and didn't really know what it</span> <span data-start="124" data-end="126.61">was and so I started to investigate and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="126.61" data-end="128.35">I won't and this kind of adventure</span> <span data-start="128.35" data-end="130.75">journey here I'm asking myself what</span> <span data-start="130.75" data-end="133.84">couch TV actually is and so first thing</span> <span data-start="133.84" data-end="135.94">I saw was a sign that said it's not an</span> <span data-start="135.94" data-end="139.51">SQL database instead it's a key value</span> <span data-start="139.51" data-end="142.51">store which means you can buy keys and</span> <span data-start="142.51" data-end="146.2">values and you can put values into it</span> <span data-start="146.2" data-end="148.78">and then have keys and get them out</span> <span data-start="148.78" data-end="152.65">again and so I started talking to the</span> <span data-start="152.65" data-end="155.74">couch as the digital natives you know</span> <span data-start="155.74" data-end="159.28">what comes naturally for me is HDPE so I</span> <span data-start="159.28" data-end="161.26">didn't know what a couch would respond</span> <span data-start="161.26" data-end="165.28">to so joy try the HDTV and surprisingly</span> <span data-start="165.28" data-end="167.08">that worked and the couch responded and</span> <span data-start="167.08" data-end="168.01">talked back to me</span> <span data-start="168.01" data-end="170.44">and so this is the first thing as you</span> <span data-start="170.44" data-end="172.39">can see here and basically saying hi I'm</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="172.39" data-end="176.86">Alex to that couch and it says back hi</span> <span data-start="176.86" data-end="179.83">and that has stored my my requests and</span> <span data-start="179.83" data-end="183.58">you can see here I'm posting some data</span> <span data-start="183.58" data-end="187.36">to it as you can see that is JSON which</span> <span data-start="187.36" data-end="190.9">you might all be familiar with and I get</span> <span data-start="190.9" data-end="193.87">back this this ID and revision here the</span> <span data-start="193.87" data-end="198.04">ideas and the key of that data from now</span> <span data-start="198.04" data-end="202">on and so I can ask it again for that</span> <span data-start="202" data-end="204.01">document and as you can see here I'm</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="206.8">doing a get and this is the same idea</span> <span data-start="206.8" data-end="208.81">that it just gave me under step before</span> <span data-start="208.81" data-end="211.959">and so the couch again talks back and</span> <span data-start="211.959" data-end="216.77">gives me the data I just stored in it</span> <span data-start="216.78" data-end="220">next I wanted to know all the speakers</span> <span data-start="220" data-end="223.09">at this conference and so I told coach</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="223.09" data-end="225.16">TV about this map function I had made up</span> <span data-start="225.16" data-end="231.82">and what this internally does it takes</span> <span data-start="231.82" data-end="234.94">that function and then takes every</span> <span data-start="234.94" data-end="237.1">document and in that database every like</span> <span data-start="237.1" data-end="239.62">chunk of data and processes it with it</span> <span data-start="239.62" data-end="242.44">and as you can see here my data has some</span> <span data-start="242.44" data-end="244.55">kind of speaker property</span> <span data-start="244.55" data-end="248.06">and if that hazard then it's sort of</span> <span data-start="248.06" data-end="250.85">return said so I'm not going to</span> <span data-start="250.85" data-end="252.14">magically details about the MapReduce</span> <span data-start="252.14" data-end="254">how it works because it's kind of</span> <span data-start="254" data-end="257.84">complicated sometimes but so um the</span> <span data-start="257.84" data-end="260.18">thing is it'll just collect all the</span> <span data-start="260.18" data-end="261.89">speakers that are in the database and</span> <span data-start="261.89" data-end="263.9">return them which you can see here on</span> <span data-start="263.9" data-end="266.24">the right side so I mean there's so not</span> <span data-start="266.24" data-end="273.68">all of us but most so I again talk to it</span> <span data-start="273.68" data-end="275.03">and I wanted to know how many speakers</span> <span data-start="275.03" data-end="278.66">are actually where and for this I passed</span> <span data-start="278.66" data-end="281.48">in or gave it this reduce function which</span> <span data-start="281.48" data-end="284.15">looks quite simple so it sums up all</span> <span data-start="284.15" data-end="287.24">these ones that you can see here and it</span> <span data-start="287.24" data-end="291.59">said okay there's 23 speakers and yeah</span> <span data-start="291.59" data-end="293.66">pretty nice so I look down at the couch</span> <span data-start="293.66" data-end="295.82">and at the Eternals and wanted to know</span> <span data-start="295.82" data-end="298.37">what it was and so you can see here at</span> <span data-start="298.37" data-end="301.16">the left it's kind of this big sucking</span> <span data-start="301.16" data-end="303.56">machine that sucks up all the documents</span> <span data-start="303.56" data-end="307.28">here and there at the bottom and gives</span> <span data-start="307.28" data-end="310.04">them to me when I request them so I can</span> <span data-start="310.04" data-end="311.87">whenever have the key to a document I</span> <span data-start="311.87" data-end="315.38">can load it using this which is very</span> <span data-start="315.38" data-end="317">simple that's why it's a key value store</span> <span data-start="317" data-end="318.89">right and then there's this other thing</span> <span data-start="318.89" data-end="325.01">which kind of has these pipes and when I</span> <span data-start="325.01" data-end="328.19">give it a rip function like give me all</span> <span data-start="328.19" data-end="332.03">the speakers it'll like internally sort</span> <span data-start="332.03" data-end="333.85">of create one of those pipes and then</span> <span data-start="333.85" data-end="336.59">like so are the speakers ready for me so</span> <span data-start="336.59" data-end="337.97">whenever I ask it they're already</span> <span data-start="337.97" data-end="340.55">available and I can just get them so as</span> <span data-start="340.55" data-end="343.43">you can see here it says speaker so it's</span> <span data-start="343.43" data-end="344.87">the speaker's pipe and I can just say</span> <span data-start="344.87" data-end="346.9">give me the speakers and they're there</span> <span data-start="346.9" data-end="350.15">um what I was added also looked at MySQL</span> <span data-start="350.15" data-end="353.06">again a bit but um well as you can see</span> <span data-start="353.06" data-end="354.89">it's all sorted into tables at button</span> <span data-start="354.89" data-end="359.54">but it gets messy by the rap so I went</span> <span data-start="359.54" data-end="362.87">on back to the couch looked up and it</span> <span data-start="362.87" data-end="366.5">was again and those boards here are a</span> <span data-start="366.5" data-end="369.73">few documents edit corrected for me and</span> <span data-start="369.73" data-end="372.35">so suddenly there was four couches and</span> <span data-start="372.35" data-end="374.6">not just one and they all had the same</span> <span data-start="374.6" data-end="375.76">data so</span> <span data-start="375.76" data-end="377.98">what country we can do is replicate</span> <span data-start="377.98" data-end="380.53">itself which becomes important later on</span> <span data-start="380.53" data-end="382.99">and whenever I change something in one</span> <span data-start="382.99" data-end="384.61">of those couches or the others will pick</span> <span data-start="384.61" data-end="390.97">up and just have those same documents as</span> <span data-start="390.97" data-end="392.62">the one I changed so I can change any of</span> <span data-start="392.62" data-end="394.2">those cultures and it'll automatically</span> <span data-start="394.2" data-end="396.4">transfer the data to the other couch TV</span> <span data-start="396.4" data-end="398.94">couch the weeks um</span> <span data-start="398.94" data-end="402.07">couches can live in servers like this</span> <span data-start="402.07" data-end="405.67">one they can also live in like laptops</span> <span data-start="405.67" data-end="407.86">which um doesn't come as a big surprise</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="407.86" data-end="410.68">I guess um but you can also run on</span> <span data-start="410.68" data-end="413.47">phones which can become quite</span> <span data-start="413.47" data-end="416.01">interesting as we will see a bit later</span> <span data-start="416.01" data-end="419.32">anyway so that was a long day and I said</span> <span data-start="419.32" data-end="421.24">on the couch and watch the sunset at</span> <span data-start="421.24" data-end="426.76">middle and it's already the end of part</span> <span data-start="426.76" data-end="429.61">one of this talk and what we fluency for</span> <span data-start="429.61" data-end="433.3">we using JSON to to store data in the</span> <span data-start="433.3" data-end="438.34">database um it has an HTTP interface so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="438.34" data-end="441.31">I can talk to it if I talk it should be</span> <span data-start="441.31" data-end="444.52">myself but can you take dude I can't</span> <span data-start="444.52" data-end="447.43">speak to directly I can use a browser or</span> <span data-start="447.43" data-end="451.81">any HTTP client I want I can pass with</span> <span data-start="451.81" data-end="454.36">those map functions to sort of extract</span> <span data-start="454.36" data-end="458.11">data from it and I can pass those reduce</span> <span data-start="458.11" data-end="459.79">functions to do calculations on that</span> <span data-start="459.79" data-end="462.16">data it's sort of the essence of those</span> <span data-start="462.16" data-end="465.34">two and it has this replication which</span> <span data-start="465.34" data-end="467.47">means I can set up as many copies as I</span> <span data-start="467.47" data-end="469.96">want and I can tell it to love keep all</span> <span data-start="469.96" data-end="473.89">of them in sync so like in multi master</span> <span data-start="473.89" data-end="476.02">data they set up something which is</span> <span data-start="476.02" data-end="479.26">really a pain when using traditional</span> <span data-start="479.26" data-end="484.72">databases like MySQL for instance yeah</span> <span data-start="484.72" data-end="490.29">so that was part one</span> <span data-start="490.3" data-end="498.83">and this is part 2 so let's talk about</span> <span data-start="498.83" data-end="500.36">some apps and I have a little</span> <span data-start="500.36" data-end="502.849">co-presenter here which is Steve hearing</span> <span data-start="502.849" data-end="505.639">them on the left and it's gonna help me</span> <span data-start="505.639" data-end="509.479">present this thing and this is the first</span> <span data-start="509.479" data-end="512.719">slide um I think that's the other</span> <span data-start="512.719" data-end="518">presentation so let's move on so am the</span> <span data-start="518" data-end="524.06">apps um apps are this which is a couch</span> <span data-start="524.06" data-end="527.42">and the apps live inside the couch which</span> <span data-start="527.42" data-end="529.81">is why they are called couch apps and</span> <span data-start="529.81" data-end="532.76">basically what that all is is JavaScript</span> <span data-start="532.76" data-end="535.67">on the server side and in this case the</span> <span data-start="535.67" data-end="536.87">server is</span> <span data-start="536.87" data-end="539.209">couchdb so you can run those apps inside</span> <span data-start="539.209" data-end="545.269">the database and then deliver them to a</span> <span data-start="545.269" data-end="549.17">browser we have documents as you've</span> <span data-start="549.17" data-end="551.329">already seen you can just put any JSON</span> <span data-start="551.329" data-end="554.66">into couchdb and then it's gonna be</span> <span data-start="554.66" data-end="556.07">stored there and you can get it back if</span> <span data-start="556.07" data-end="559.339">you want to you can also have</span> <span data-start="559.339" data-end="560.87">attachments which can be anything you</span> <span data-start="560.87" data-end="564.32">want anything binary data HTML pages yes</span> <span data-start="564.32" data-end="566.589">as far as good whatever videos you want</span> <span data-start="566.589" data-end="569.029">which comes in handy when you talk to a</span> <span data-start="569.029" data-end="573.41">browser we have those views that this</span> <span data-start="573.41" data-end="578.48">that is a map function thing so you can</span> <span data-start="578.48" data-end="582.56">extract data so if I have documents with</span> <span data-start="582.56" data-end="584.3">speakers I can get a list of speakers or</span> <span data-start="584.3" data-end="588.589">the sum of all the number of speakers</span> <span data-start="588.589" data-end="591.01">and that kind of stuff</span> <span data-start="591.01" data-end="594.94">we have shows which can be used to</span> <span data-start="594.94" data-end="598.339">transform a single document into</span> <span data-start="598.339" data-end="600.98">anything else which might be a just</span> <span data-start="600.98" data-end="603.11">email in this case I could be XML it</span> <span data-start="603.11" data-end="606.459">could even be binary data I think and</span> <span data-start="606.459" data-end="610.13">yeah so this allows you to serve a</span> <span data-start="610.13" data-end="612.29">document to a browser or some other</span> <span data-start="612.29" data-end="612.649">class</span> <span data-start="612.649" data-end="617.709">like say like some RSS reader or so and</span> <span data-start="617.709" data-end="619.97">transform it into a format that this</span> <span data-start="619.97" data-end="622.61">client can understand and we have lists</span> <span data-start="622.61" data-end="625.069">and that is the same thing but it's not</span> <span data-start="625.069" data-end="627.139">working on a single document but on a</span> <span data-start="627.139" data-end="631.49">view so you can admit or you can serve a</span> <span data-start="631.49" data-end="636.319">list of data or anything you want and we</span> <span data-start="636.319" data-end="639.639">have updates and updates</span> <span data-start="639.639" data-end="642.369">well they update they don't so you can</span> <span data-start="642.369" data-end="647.809">post output to the database a little</span> <span data-start="647.809" data-end="652.759">update data and you can run code in this</span> <span data-start="652.759" data-end="655.22">so it's not like a fixed thing but you</span> <span data-start="655.22" data-end="657.41">run code well and tell it what to update</span> <span data-start="657.41" data-end="662.779">from the request so like like a real</span> <span data-start="662.779" data-end="663.279">server</span> <span data-start="663.279" data-end="666.41">um so anyway um this is the short</span> <span data-start="666.41" data-end="671.689">overview of what couch apps are and

mean why not have an app store</span> <span data-start="1634.18" data-end="1637.03">and they get giant couch TV somewhere</span> <span data-start="1637.03" data-end="1638.68">and then people can just

some</span> <span data-start="1643.24" data-end="1645.61">some sort of even better open source</span> <span data-start="1645.61" data-end="1648.43">word than we have now because whenever</span> <span data-start="1648.43" data-end="1650.5">you run an application you have access</span> <span data-start="1650.5" data-end="1652.63">to the code and you can change it and</span> <span

data-start="1658.21" data-end="1660.7">and it might be a pretty a pretty nice</span> <span data-start="1660.7" data-end="1663.97">scenario having those apps everywhere</span> <span data-start="1663.97" data-end="1667.179">and everyone can hack on them which</span> <span data-start="1667.179" data-end="1668.71">isn't my idea and I didn't come up with</span> <span
