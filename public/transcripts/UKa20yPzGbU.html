<p><span data-start="14.889" data-end="15.889">Thanks, guys, for the great introduction.</span> <span data-start="15.889" data-end="19.5">So today we're going to talk about something that's totally practical,</span> <span data-start="19.5" data-end="22.72">and that you can use daily in your job.</span> <span data-start="22.72" data-end="32.86">We are going to recreate the dialup modem in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="32.86" data-end="38.22">So maybe you guys have a memory of this.</span> <span data-start="38.22" data-end="39.51">(Pshhhkkkkkrrrrkakingkakingkakingtshchchchchchchchchdingdingding)</span> <span data-start="39.51" data-end="44.68">Oh, we have audio?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="44.68" data-end="47.27">So this..</span> <span data-start="47.27" data-end="51.149">May sound familiar.</span> <span data-start="51.149" data-end="58.66">And bring back great memories.</span> <span data-start="58.66" data-end="66.18">Connecting to the internet.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.18" data-end="73.7">That's enough of that.</span> <span data-start="73.7" data-end="79.869">So once we were online, our experience was something like this.</span> <span data-start="79.869" data-end="82.21">Yes!</span> <span data-start="82.21" data-end="84.17">Wonderful progressive loading.</span> <span data-start="84.17" data-end="85.729">Slow connection.</span> <span data-start="85.729" data-end="89.4">A beautiful thing.</span> <span data-start="89.4" data-end="90.62">So who am I?</span> <span data-start="90.62" data-end="92.55">My name is Sam Saccone.</span> <span data-start="92.55" data-end="98.28">I'm a developer at a consultancy in Rhode Island, called Mojotech.</span> <span data-start="98.28" data-end="105.07">I write software by day, and typically make problems on Open Source projects</span> <span data-start="105.07" data-end="107.18">at night.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="107.18" data-end="113.81">So let's start off with the question: what is sound?</span> <span data-start="113.81" data-end="118.289">So sound is vibrations that travel through the air.</span> <span data-start="118.289" data-end="121.45">And for us, we pick up those vibrations, or pressure changes, with</span> <span data-start="121.45" data-end="125">our eardrum, and it's converted to an electrical signal that our brain</span> <span data-start="125" data-end="127.67">interprets, and we perceive sound.</span> <span data-start="127.67" data-end="133.04">But in this case, my computer microphone is picking up that sound, I'm plotting the raw</span> <span data-start="133.04" data-end="138.35">DCM data onto the screen, and this is what most of us think about sound when</span> <span data-start="138.35" data-end="139.519">we see a wave form.</span> <span data-start="139.519" data-end="150.519">An audio  —  a visualization of it.</span> <span data-start="150.519" data-end="151.91">So what is data?</span> <span data-start="151.91" data-end="154.98">And these are the  —  sound and data are the two components</span> <span data-start="154.98" data-end="158.11">that are going to help us put together a modem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.11" data-end="162.19">So data for a computer is zeroes and ones.</span> <span data-start="162.19" data-end="164.01">It's binary data.</span> <span data-start="164.01" data-end="165.7">It's state, encoded.</span> <span data-start="165.7" data-end="169.09">But when we use a computer, we don't see zeroes and ones.</span> <span data-start="169.09" data-end="170.599">We see images.</span> <span data-start="170.599" data-end="175.11">Mp3s, zip files, git repositories.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.11" data-end="181.13">So we understand the binary data through a program which decodes</span> <span data-start="181.13" data-end="184.709">this binary information into formats that we're familiar with.</span> <span data-start="184.709" data-end="187.45">That we can perceive.</span> <span data-start="187.45" data-end="189.87">So..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="189.87" data-end="192">How do we get data into audio?</span> <span data-start="192" data-end="195.45">We have our wave form and we have our binary information.</span> <span data-start="195.45" data-end="199.16">Well, obviously it's an encoding problem.</span> <span data-start="199.16" data-end="203.629">So we need to figure out how to do that.</span> <span data-start="203.629" data-end="205.54">Humans are pretty good at encoding data.</span> <span data-start="205.54" data-end="207.23">I'm speaking to you.</span> <span data-start="207.23" data-end="209.2">You can understand me.</span> <span data-start="209.2" data-end="211.299">You can understand language.</span> <span data-start="211.299" data-end="214.13">You can understand what I'm saying.</span> <span data-start="214.13" data-end="216.65">I'm communicating ideas.</span> <span data-start="216.65" data-end="220.86">However, communication breaks down when you don't speak the language.</span> <span data-start="220.86" data-end="222.84">If I was speaking a different language that you</span> <span data-start="222.84" data-end="225.33">didn't know, you wouldn't understand what I was saying.</span> <span data-start="225.33" data-end="228.06">You wouldn't get any information.</span> <span data-start="228.06" data-end="230.05">So..</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="230.05" data-end="234.83">Language becomes the data encoding for speech.</span> <span data-start="234.83" data-end="235.83">Meaning..</span> <span data-start="235.83" data-end="239.049">This noise that I'm making would mean nothing, unless you knew English.</span> <span data-start="239.049" data-end="243.8">It would just be noise.</span> <span data-start="243.8" data-end="247.459">So how, then, do computers speak?</span> <span data-start="247.459" data-end="250.18">How do computers talk to each other?</span> <span data-start="250.18" data-end="252.15">Computers don't have a voice.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="252.15" data-end="254.65">Computers don't know how to say things.</span> <span data-start="254.65" data-end="257.42">Computers need a way to verbalize.</span> <span data-start="257.42" data-end="263.74">They need a language and a mechanism to transmit information.</span> <span data-start="263.74" data-end="265.979">So..</span> <span data-start="265.979" data-end="266.979">How do we do this?</span> <span data-start="266.979" data-end="269.59">I have my two computers, I have a wire in between them.</span> <span data-start="269.59" data-end="272.32">How do they talk?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="272.32" data-end="273.32">It's a good question.</span> <span data-start="273.32" data-end="278.589">So to understand this, I want to step back in time.</span> <span data-start="278.589" data-end="282.9">The early days of communications.</span> <span data-start="282.9" data-end="288.29">There were three primary drivers for modern day communications.</span> <span data-start="288.29" data-end="290.13">They needed to be fast.</span> <span data-start="290.13" data-end="292.55">They needed to be easy to use.</span> <span data-start="292.55" data-end="294.55">And they needed to be cheap to implement.</span> <span data-start="294.55" data-end="298.96">So obviously these three have been optimized over time, but</span> <span data-start="298.96" data-end="302.48">anything initially was great.</span> <span data-start="302.48" data-end="310.83">So in 1792, this guy, Claude, and his brother, were hanging out in France, and they were</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="316.1">out in the fields, and they heard the bell in the church ring.</span> <span data-start="316.1" data-end="317.75">They said  —  wow, that's great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="317.75" data-end="319.96">That tells me what time it is.</span> <span data-start="319.96" data-end="322.979">They said  —  well, when I'm at the house and you're at the</span> <span data-start="322.979" data-end="327.849">field and I want to tell you to come back, we should figure out some bell, so</span> <span data-start="327.849" data-end="328.89">we can communicate.</span> <span data-start="328.89" data-end="330.86">So they went inside and got these pans.</span> <span data-start="330.86" data-end="332.64">And said  —  okay.</span> <span data-start="332.64" data-end="333.64">Well, you're in the field.</span> <span data-start="333.64" data-end="334.64">I've got this pan.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="334.64" data-end="336.25">I'm going to bang on it.</span> <span data-start="336.25" data-end="339.27">And when you hear that, you know to come back.</span> <span data-start="339.27" data-end="342.77">So it was communication over remote distances.</span> <span data-start="342.77" data-end="344.71">People didn't have to be face-to-face.</span> <span data-start="344.71" data-end="346.96">They didn't have to walk up to each other and say something.</span> <span data-start="346.96" data-end="349.2">They could hit this pan, and they had this code that they</span> <span data-start="349.2" data-end="351.27">agreed on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.27" data-end="352.82">So for a while, that's what they did.</span> <span data-start="352.82" data-end="353.82">They hit these pans.</span> <span data-start="353.82" data-end="354.82">They said  —  hey, great.</span> <span data-start="354.82" data-end="356.52">We can talk from great distances.</span> <span data-start="356.52" data-end="358.5">They said..</span> <span data-start="358.5" data-end="360.89">Well, our neighbors are getting kind of mad.</span> <span data-start="360.89" data-end="361.89">It's kind of loud.</span> <span data-start="361.89" data-end="363.1">We need a better way.</span> <span data-start="363.1" data-end="364.1">They said..</span> <span data-start="364.1" data-end="365.1">Well, okay.</span> <span data-start="365.1" data-end="367">I have this telescope.</span> <span data-start="367" data-end="369.91">So how about I look at you, and you can make some symbols, and I</span> <span data-start="369.91" data-end="371.409">can understand it.</span> <span data-start="371.409" data-end="373.589">So communication over a great distance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="373.589" data-end="376.279">So this idea evolved and evolved, and they came up with</span> <span data-start="376.279" data-end="378.709">this idea of an optical telegraph.</span> <span data-start="378.709" data-end="381.58">It sounds fancy, but it's not.</span> <span data-start="381.58" data-end="385.35">It's this tower that you can sort of see with these needles on either end.</span> <span data-start="385.35" data-end="387.459">And there was this code.</span> <span data-start="387.459" data-end="388.459">One was pointed here.</span> <span data-start="388.459" data-end="392.709">This meant A. And then the other side  —  they would then point that there, and</span> <span data-start="392.709" data-end="395.71">so the next station would look with their telescope and say..</span> <span data-start="395.71" data-end="399.93">Oh, A. So they would be able to communicate a message across</span> <span data-start="399.93" data-end="401.36">vast distances.</span> <span data-start="401.36" data-end="406.41">However, it had some downsides.</span> <span data-start="406.41" data-end="408.529">If it was foggy, it didn't work.</span> <span data-start="408.529" data-end="411.39">If it was nighttime, it didn't work.</span> <span data-start="411.39" data-end="412.89">It took three people to operate.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="412.89" data-end="415.13">So it was kind of expensive.</span> <span data-start="415.13" data-end="417.78">And it was kind of error-prone, as you can imagine.</span> <span data-start="417.78" data-end="420.29">If you just had the angles  —  oh, that's a B?</span> <span data-start="420.29" data-end="424.13">No, that's an A. So it was very lossy.</span> <span data-start="424.13" data-end="427.83">But this was used in France widely, up until around</span> <span data-start="427.83" data-end="429.35">1837.</span> <span data-start="429.35" data-end="431.3">So this was a revolution.</span> <span data-start="431.3" data-end="433.709">There are these lines all over the place in France.</span> <span data-start="433.709" data-end="439.02">People were like  —  this is modern day living.</span> <span data-start="439.02" data-end="440.55">Along comes this guy.</span> <span data-start="440.55" data-end="441.55">Samuel Morse.</span> <span data-start="441.55" data-end="443.779">So France, they were cutting edge.</span> <span data-start="443.779" data-end="447.36">They were leading the front on remote communications.</span> <span data-start="447.36" data-end="450.81">And the United States was still in the dark ages.</span> <span data-start="450.81" data-end="454.84">There was like one optical telegraph line, but it wasn't really used.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.84" data-end="465.86">So Sam Morse was hanging out in a show in New York, because he was a painter,</span> <span data-start="465.86" data-end="466.86">of course.</span> <span data-start="466.86" data-end="470.3">And he got a letter from his father that his wife had fallen ill.</span> <span data-start="470.3" data-end="474.099">So a guy on a horse came up, gave him a letter  —  oh, your wife is ill.</span> <span data-start="474.099" data-end="475.099">Uh-oh.</span> <span data-start="475.099" data-end="476.57">I better get home.</span> <span data-start="476.57" data-end="480.12">So he wrote a response and sent it, and before he</span> <span data-start="480.12" data-end="484.839">even left, another horse  —  actually, two days later, another person came</span> <span data-start="484.839" data-end="486.91">and delivered another letter that said his wife had died.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="486.91" data-end="487.91">He said..</span> <span data-start="487.91" data-end="491.899">Wow, I never even had time to send a response or get home, because there was such</span> <span data-start="491.899" data-end="494.59">delay in this communication.</span> <span data-start="494.59" data-end="497.339">So he was distraught, and he went back to Europe</span> <span data-start="497.339" data-end="501.78">for his wife's funeral, and he met someone on the boat who said..</span> <span data-start="501.78" data-end="505.18">Hey, you heard of this thing called electricity?</span> <span data-start="505.18" data-end="508.52">And at this time, electricity was a parlor trick.</span> <span data-start="508.52" data-end="510.279">People didn't understand how it worked.</span> <span data-start="510.279" data-end="511.82">It was viewed as kind of magical.</span> <span data-start="511.82" data-end="512.82">Well, look.</span> <span data-start="512.82" data-end="515.779">If I have this magnet, and I pass a current through</span> <span data-start="515.779" data-end="517.01">this wire, this magnet changes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.01" data-end="520.63">And it's a concept of electromagnetism.</span> <span data-start="520.63" data-end="527.55">And he had this idea that I can create a communication system using this electromagnetism</span> <span data-start="527.55" data-end="531.15">concept, where I pass a current through the wire, using a rhythmic</span> <span data-start="531.15" data-end="535.72">tone, so it's both on/off, Morse code, and also temporal.</span> <span data-start="535.72" data-end="538.27">So long dash, short dash.</span> <span data-start="538.27" data-end="543.11">So he pushed forward, came back to the United States, eventually convinced</span> <span data-start="543.11" data-end="545.11">people that this is a real thing.</span> <span data-start="545.11" data-end="547.07">And people didn't want to believe him, because it was still kind of</span> <span data-start="547.07" data-end="548.07">weird.</span> <span data-start="548.07" data-end="551.9">So he actually would run wires from one room to another, and have</span> <span data-start="551.9" data-end="556.19">people in both rooms, and send a message, and then a third party would verify</span> <span data-start="556.19" data-end="557.25">that the message was real.</span> <span data-start="557.25" data-end="560.11">Because they thought it was some magic trick.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="560.11" data-end="564.94">So Morse code kind of swept the nation.</span> <span data-start="564.94" data-end="565.94">Everywhere was connected.</span> <span data-start="565.94" data-end="568.63">In a matter of 20 years, 30 years.</span> <span data-start="568.63" data-end="571.58">There were these telegraphy lines that ran all across the</span> <span data-start="571.58" data-end="572.58">world.</span> <span data-start="572.58" data-end="575.11">So it made it possible for people to communicate from one side of the</span> <span data-start="575.11" data-end="576.47">world to the other immediately.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="576.47" data-end="584.03">So you could know the price of alligator skin in New York, every day, versus once every</span> <span data-start="584.03" data-end="585.03">six months.</span> <span data-start="585.03" data-end="586.24">But people loved it.</span> <span data-start="586.24" data-end="590.1">It made communicating to relatives in California</span> <span data-start="590.1" data-end="591.1">not take ten days.</span> <span data-start="591.1" data-end="592.97">Because that was as fast as it could happen, before this</span> <span data-start="592.97" data-end="594.57">was invented.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="594.57" data-end="599.68">It also put out of business the Pony Express, which is unfortunate.</span> <span data-start="599.68" data-end="601.11">So okay, here we are.</span> <span data-start="601.11" data-end="603.32">We have these telegraph lines running across the</span> <span data-start="603.32" data-end="605.06">country, across the world.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="605.06" data-end="607.06">These lines are kind of expensive to run.</span> <span data-start="607.06" data-end="609.38">They have them running under the ocean.</span> <span data-start="609.38" data-end="610.38">It's crazy.</span> <span data-start="610.38" data-end="611.86">We can talk to Europe.</span> <span data-start="611.86" data-end="613.17">Everywhere.</span> <span data-start="613.17" data-end="616.07">So this guy Emil comes along.</span> <span data-start="616.07" data-end="617.46">And he says..</span> <span data-start="617.46" data-end="618.46">Hey.</span> <span data-start="618.46" data-end="622.2">These Morse code operators, they're really expensive to hire.</span> <span data-start="622.2" data-end="623.32">Incredibly expensive.</span> <span data-start="623.32" data-end="625.87">They're like modern day software developers.</span> <span data-start="625.87" data-end="627.81">They can go anywhere they want.</span> <span data-start="627.81" data-end="632.66">It's like  —  oh, wow, you can transmit 90 characters per second?</span> <span data-start="632.66" data-end="633.89">You're amazing!</span> <span data-start="633.89" data-end="635.82">But he said..</span> </p>
