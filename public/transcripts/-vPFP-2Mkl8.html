<p><span data-start="216.9" data-end="220.93">Or in my case, get up here and give a talk about it.</span> <span data-start="220.93" data-end="228.04">And this was given by the Prime Minister of the UK back in the 19th century.</span> <span data-start="228.04" data-end="234.43">So, let's just face it, asynchronous programming as we know it today is annoying, because by</span> <span data-start="234.43" data-end="239.43">themselves you have every library and every certain thing doing it's own thing, whether</span> <span data-start="239.43" data-end="246.209">it's call backs and promises doing one thing where it's yielding a single value verse events</span> <span data-start="246.209" data-end="251.919">where there's dealing with multiple values so each concept is covering it's own little</span> <span data-start="251.919" data-end="255.07">piece of the story, not the whole piece.</span> <span data-start="255.07" data-end="260.51">So just to kind of give you an example here, you'd certainly wouldn't call a promise on</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="266.9">an event that you expect for more than one of just as you wouldn't, you wouldn't normally</span> <span data-start="266.9" data-end="270.8">need a collection to describe a single value.</span> <span data-start="270.8" data-end="277.02">But, even more than that, how about if I want to make a web request and then combine that</span> <span data-start="277.02" data-end="282.84">with getting the key press event so that I can send my data over to that and then we</span> <span data-start="282.84" data-end="286.68">need to make sure that we're not overloading the server.</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="292.81">How do we think about that when we're just talked about promises, call backs, timers,</span> <span data-start="292.81" data-end="294.8">etc., how do we deal with that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="294.8" data-end="300.75">Is there a better way that we can think about asynchronous and event‑based programming?</span> <span data-start="300.75" data-end="309.08">Well, we had a very forward thinking president in the United States who the early '60s came</span> <span data-start="309.08" data-end="311.3">to this very city and said.</span> <span data-start="311.3" data-end="318.83">ch Eii Berliner, we also said we chose to solve asynchronous programming not because</span> <span data-start="318.83" data-end="328.15">it's easy but because they're hard\h‑‑ citation needed\h‑‑ damn it Wikipedia.</span> <span data-start="328.15" data-end="331.75">So call back hell is very much a real thing.</span> <span data-start="331.75" data-end="338.18">So, when you're dealing with call back hell you've got nested function after nested function</span> <span data-start="338.18" data-end="342.5">where you're trying to accomplish something Lynn I can't recallly, so for example\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="342.5" data-end="343.5">linearly.</span> <span data-start="343.5" data-end="349.37">So for here, I might want to play a movie, what that entails is making sure that the</span> <span data-start="349.37" data-end="356.75">players initialized that I'm authorized to do so, then when I'm done it authorizes me</span> <span data-start="356.75" data-end="359.949">with a movie ticket.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="359.949" data-end="363.469">And what you end up with a cow's head.</span> <span data-start="363.469" data-end="368.379">All your code all it looks like is just a cow's head at that point, somewhere the logic</span> <span data-start="368.379" data-end="369.87">gets lost.</span> <span data-start="369.87" data-end="372.34">And it's se evil.</span> <span data-start="372.34" data-end="379.229">So I don't know about you, when ever I write code like that, this usually happens.</span> <span data-start="379.229" data-end="388.979">And it's not easy to recover from getting bush burned like that.</span> <span data-start="388.979" data-end="394.25">And just as well, event‑based programming is just as annoying, say for example we want</span> <span data-start="394.25" data-end="400.759">to create a drag event, a custom kind of event that we do on our own, so what we would need</span> <span data-start="400.759" data-end="405.279">for that, we would need to say whether the mouse is down or not have some stay test to</span> <span data-start="405.279" data-end="407.949">where the mouse is.</span> <span data-start="407.949" data-end="412.62">Then in the mouse down we would have to say, okay, spouse down, here's with we started,</span> <span data-start="412.62" data-end="418.319">mouse move, we go, okay, mouse is down, let's do some calculations and on a mouse up, we</span> <span data-start="418.319" data-end="421.86">say, everything's done, we're good to go.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="421.86" data-end="428.94">And we have to, of course, not only add the event listeners, but we also have to remove</span> <span data-start="428.94" data-end="431.27">them as well.</span> <span data-start="431.27" data-end="435.93">And that gets pretty darn annoying.</span> <span data-start="435.93" data-end="442.06">And so when you're dealing with that much state, once again you're juggling and you</span> <span data-start="442.06" data-end="444.27">just can't hold it.</span> <span data-start="444.27" data-end="451.24">Especially when you're just trying to do something else\h‑‑ add something new to your program,</span> <span data-start="451.24" data-end="454.12">that's what you end up with.</span> <span data-start="454.12" data-end="464.199">So let's talk a little bit asynchronous programming landscape, the landscape in general.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="464.199" data-end="470.81">Two accessese siss, one to describe synchronous and one to describe asynchronous behavior,</span> <span data-start="470.81" data-end="475.699">one to describe a single value and one to say it's multiple.</span> <span data-start="475.699" data-end="482.11">For example, when you're dealing with a value you call a function or you assign it a value,</span> <span data-start="482.11" data-end="484.309">that's a value, good.</span> <span data-start="484.309" data-end="492.939">An iterble is a collection so in JavaScript we have arrays, we have maps, sets, arguments,</span> <span data-start="492.939" data-end="498.06">anything that's iterble here, and then we can apply higher order operation such as map,</span> <span data-start="498.06" data-end="500.339">filter and for each.</span> <span data-start="500.339" data-end="507.77">But what about asynchronous single values, we have call backs but we also have promises,</span> <span data-start="507.77" data-end="513.88">now promises are very interesting in the fact that now instead of the call back function,</span> <span data-start="513.88" data-end="518.21">you have a first class object that you can pass around the people that describes what</span> <span data-start="518.21" data-end="521.419">that value eventually will be.</span> <span data-start="521.419" data-end="525.27">And that's not something you can necessarily do with a call back, I can't hand you a call</span> <span data-start="525.27" data-end="530.59">back and say this represents a value, doesn't work that way.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.59" data-end="536.37">And then what I'll put in the fourth quadrant and final quadrant is observable, now observable</span> <span data-start="536.37" data-end="543.02">as you will see is asynchronous in it's very nature so you can take the same stock data,</span> <span data-start="543.02" data-end="548.7">you can filter it, map it, and you can four each it, no code changed at all in terms of</span> <span data-start="548.7" data-end="553.55">what you're coding on the client, non, nothing, whatsoever.</span> <span data-start="553.55" data-end="559.781">That's very, very intentional about what we've done with the observable design, so if you</span> <span data-start="559.781" data-end="567.62">know how to program against collections then you know how to program against observables.</span> <span data-start="567.62" data-end="572.52">What I like to say, a lot of the times is that your mouse is also a database, it's a</span> <span data-start="572.52" data-end="579.35">database of coordinates you'll get eventually when the mouse moves, it should be as querible</span> <span data-start="579.35" data-end="582.5">as an iterative sequence is.</span> <span data-start="582.5" data-end="589.63">So, the thing that I like about these abstractions is that they're first class.</span> <span data-start="589.63" data-end="595.16">And then what it means by first class is the fact that I can pass one of these objects</span> <span data-start="595.16" data-end="602.7">whether it's an observable, or it's a promise to a function and I can also return it from</span> <span data-start="602.7" data-end="604.18">a function.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="604.18" data-end="610.41">And so what that gives us it gives us a lot of little flexibility when it comes to querying</span> <span data-start="610.41" data-end="616.87">something or for testing for mocking whatever else it is, it's really nice for us to do</span> <span data-start="616.87" data-end="617.87">that.</span> <span data-start="617.87" data-end="623.7">Now, promises, I'm sure you've heard a lot about, I hear already, I've seen it mentioned</span> <span data-start="623.7" data-end="626.18">a good number of talks already.</span> <span data-start="626.18" data-end="630.68">Now promises are great because they're pretty much in every single library that are out</span> <span data-start="630.68" data-end="637.88">there nowadays, and that have pretty much the same behavior outside of jQuery, they</span> <span data-start="637.88" data-end="643.04">have pretty much the same behavior so you can think about them pretty much the same,</span> <span data-start="643.04" data-end="651.04">asynchronous handled, and once you're done, it's done, everyone gets the same answer,</span> <span data-start="651.04" data-end="656.64">so we can take the previous thing that we talked about, the call back hell and distill</span> <span data-start="656.64" data-end="661.84">it down to the player initialized authorizing the movie, if you're handling the log‑inner</span> <span data-start="661.84" data-end="665.58">report, playing the movie saying you're unauthorized.</span> <span data-start="665.58" data-end="673.33">No more trying to finish and detecting whether this state is available or not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="673.33" data-end="679.74">But, there's some problems I have, at least, when it comes to promises, promises don't</span> <span data-start="679.74" data-end="681.13">solve everything.</span> <span data-start="681.13" data-end="687.77">So, for example cancellation is not a part of the contract for promises in ES 6.</span> <span data-start="687.77" data-end="693.31">Why? Because there are a good number of reasons you want most people to fall into the happy</span> <span data-start="693.31" data-end="699.28">path and be pretty productive, but it's very much the case when you deal with a lot of</span> <span data-start="699.28" data-end="707.93">things such as dealing with IO where cooperationlation is a normal part of what do you and what about</span> <span data-start="707.93" data-end="712.19">situations with an auto complete that you just don't care about the value that comes</span> <span data-start="712.19" data-end="713.19">back.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="713.19" data-end="719.98">In this particular case here, how do I cancel that again? I don't\h‑‑ I'm not really</span> <span data-start="719.98" data-end="727.13">interested in this anymore? I I don't know so do I create a cancellation promise and</span> <span data-start="727.13" data-end="734.17">I sub class the regular promise? Do I mass a cancellation token? Do I\h‑‑ or do I</span> <span data-start="734.17" data-end="741.1">just use a library like last from Donmick Dencola, all of those are perfectly optionble</span> <span data-start="741.1" data-end="742.1">options.</span> <span data-start="742.1" data-end="750.69">When I talk about reactive programming, it's a very kind of fuzz city definition just like</span> <span data-start="750.69" data-end="752.63">functional programming is.</span> <span data-start="752.63" data-end="757.82">Says functional programming, application of functions, not helpful.</span> <span data-start="757.82" data-end="763.67">So what we're trying to do is trying to figure out exactly what we could call reactive programming.</span> <span data-start="763.67" data-end="772.12">So, the dictionary says readily responds to a stimulus, well isn't that just normal programming?</span> <span data-start="772.12" data-end="777.7">What else is interesting about it? Well, reacting to events is certainly one thing that reactive</span> <span data-start="777.7" data-end="784.33">applications do, but they also react to load, so the fact is that you can spin up more instances</span> <span data-start="784.33" data-end="789.99">to handle data, you can determine whether you need to drop data and so forth.</span> <span data-start="789.99" data-end="797.88">You can react to failure, so if at any point that you need to handle some errors and return</span> <span data-start="797.88" data-end="800.3">it from cache, you can certainly do that.</span> <span data-start="800.3" data-end="806.32">But, to me, most importantly is reacting to your user.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="806.32" data-end="812.37">The last thing you want to do is have your JavaScript page be unresponsive to a particular</span> <span data-start="812.37" data-end="813.37">user.</span> <span data-start="813.37" data-end="820.24">And, what I'd like to say is, you know, the reactive extension stuff that I've done has</span> <span data-start="820.24" data-end="825.68">played a little bit of a role, there's a lot of hype, obviously around there with Gartner</span> <span data-start="825.68" data-end="831">and so forth with reactive programming, when I talk about reactive programming here, I'm</span> <span data-start="831" data-end="837.45">just talking about observables, why don't we take the previous example of that mouse</span> <span data-start="837.45" data-end="843.54">drag and kind of turn it inside out and turn it in to an observable solution, what would</span> <span data-start="843.54" data-end="849.67">it look like? Well, if we had this first class object of the mouse down, we can take that</span> <span data-start="849.67" data-end="856.35">and combine\h‑‑ and start to do a calculus so flat map will basically it will take a</span> <span data-start="856.35" data-end="863.22">sequence and it will flatten it into a single value or a single stream of values rather.</span> <span data-start="863.22" data-end="867.99">We can calculate the offset of where we started for every mouse down.</span> <span data-start="867.99" data-end="872.82">Now, we can start to take the mouse moves by once again using functional programming</span> <span data-start="872.82" data-end="878.25">things that we already know with using arrays, and the array extras we can say take the mouse</span> <span data-start="878.25" data-end="884.73">move, which is also another first class object, map it so we can design to give the left and</span> <span data-start="884.73" data-end="888.21">the top so the total differential between the two.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="888.21" data-end="889.21">Okay.</span> <span data-start="889.21" data-end="890.21">Pretty good.</span> <span data-start="890.21" data-end="896">So, the problem is we'll be going like this and then forever it'll keep ongoing because</span> <span data-start="896" data-end="898.59">it never responds to the mouse up.</span> <span data-start="898.59" data-end="902.38">But we can fix that by saying take until mouse up.</span> <span data-start="902.38" data-end="908.74">So mouse up, once again, a first class object, we can say when ever this fires stop the sequence,</span> <span data-start="908.74" data-end="910.59">we're done.</span> <span data-start="910.59" data-end="917.25">And even holds a little bit more promise sufficient it to say when you're dealing with promises.</span> <span data-start="917.25" data-end="925.49">So, what if we want to take some input as it were, take the inputs value and then we're</span> <span data-start="925.49" data-end="932.21">going to call\h‑‑ make an auto complete scenario here, what we want to do is we don't</span> <span data-start="932.21" data-end="939.31">want to overload the server because our Bandwidth is time and money, quite honestly, so what</span> <span data-start="939.31" data-end="945.04">do we need to do to fix that, well, we have things such as throttle,throttle or debounce</span> <span data-start="945.04" data-end="950.93">as most people know it where you can type, type, type, stop for half a second and suddenly</span> <span data-start="950.93" data-end="952.05">it'll fire.</span> <span data-start="952.05" data-end="953.05">Excellent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="953.05" data-end="959.44">So, if\h‑‑ when we're thinking about observables, we're thinking about once again back to the</span> <span data-start="959.44" data-end="964.66">access there, we have the observable and we have the observable and the notion of acinous</span> <span data-start="964.66" data-end="975.15">or time based we can get the value (Asynchronous did) we can call a service which might be</span> <span data-start="975.15" data-end="978.75">a promise only getting the last one.</span> <span data-start="978.75" data-end="983.53">So one of the biggest problem problems with asynchronous programming is what? Is that</span> <span data-start="983.53" data-end="992.48">you are dealing with the fact that you could get out of order responses and this fixes</span> <span data-start="992.48" data-end="995.62">and then you bind that to the UI and you're good to go.</span> <span data-start="995.62" data-end="1001.54">Even more complex things, I'm not going to bother explaining all of this, even more complex</span> <span data-start="1001.54" data-end="1008.87">things such as poling for more updates that's complicated by RX handles it just fine.</span> <span data-start="1008.87" data-end="1013.26">What we fled to know is everything's a stream.</span> <span data-start="1013.26" data-end="1019.13">It's a very zen like moment, you're like, yes, I got this.</span> <span data-start="1019.13" data-end="1027.36">This is not to be confused with FRP, FRP is a notion of continuous time, behaviors are</span> <span data-start="1027.36" data-end="1035.75">objects with a continuous piece of time, and a continuous value, whereas events are different.</span> <span data-start="1035.75" data-end="1039.11">Events only have values when they fire.</span> <span data-start="1039.11" data-end="1044.72">And most of those\h‑‑ what it is not, it is not just any old library that has map</span> <span data-start="1044.72" data-end="1050.33">filter and reduce on observables, so most FRP libraries aren't.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1050.33" data-end="1053.76">So, what about generators.</span> <span data-start="1053.76" data-end="1059.62">So, I'm sure that a lot of people have seen what generator cans do, and so yield suspends</span> <span data-start="1059.62" data-end="1065.409">the functiontion and resumes when you actually get the value back, and a number of libraries</span> <span data-start="1065.409" data-end="1067.1">already support this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1067.1" data-end="1076.169">Well, the library that I work on does it as well, as well as Q Co you can say retry three</span> <span data-start="1076.169" data-end="1084.34">times here and you still get the benefit of observables, yet you get a very linear imperative</span> <span data-start="1084.34" data-end="1085.34">style.</span> <span data-start="1085.34" data-end="1093.69">CSP, Eh, I'm okay, on it, it's interesting, but a lot of people seem to love CAR.Async,</span> <span data-start="1093.69" data-end="1100.049">they seem to think that it's a good win.</span> <span data-start="1100.049" data-end="1106.1">Like I said, I'm not all that amused by it because it makes error handling very manual,</span> <span data-start="1106.1" data-end="1109.97">it makes resource management very manual.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1109.97" data-end="1113.789">Not a far.</span> <span data-start="1113.789" data-end="1121.419">Asink await also is very worthwhile in terms of discovering what's new in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="1121.419" data-end="1127.389">So what we have is we have Async await which has been approved for ES 7, at least the first</span> <span data-start="1127.389" data-end="1129.429">stage.</span> <span data-start="1129.429" data-end="1135.929">We can now take some animations and we can start to await each one as it comes through.</span> <span data-start="1135.929" data-end="1137.12">That's pretty powerful.</span> <span data-start="1137.12" data-end="1141.179">So it makes it explicit that we're dealing with an asin crow next so we don't have to</span> <span data-start="1141.179" data-end="1149.929">deal with function star and yield stuff, it makes it very, very obvious.</span> <span data-start="1149.929" data-end="1152.73">Now let's QUICly talk about stream processing.</span> <span data-start="1152.73" data-end="1158.17">Now, when you near node, I don't know how many people dealt with streams 1, but let's</span> <span data-start="1158.17" data-end="1160.99">face it, it was awful.</span> <span data-start="1160.99" data-end="1167.41">The pause didn't, data didn't start meetly, can't consume a number of bytes, everything</span> <span data-start="1167.41" data-end="1168.94">was just shoved at you.</span> <span data-start="1168.94" data-end="1170.94">Pause and resume was impossible.</span> <span data-start="1170.94" data-end="1186.38">It was basically this (Laughing) so, then we got streams 2 which land in the 0.9 and</span> <span data-start="1186.38" data-end="1195.34">eventually the stable 0.10, supported object mode, instant now and everything was good,</span> <span data-start="1195.34" data-end="1201.409">then we got readable/writable classes, which was good, duplex and pass throughs and streams</span> <span data-start="1201.409" data-end="1214.1">33 and a third when ever they decide to land and V 0.12 (Giggles) I'm sure that'll solve</span> <span data-start="1214.1" data-end="1215.159">everything too.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1215.159" data-end="1221.72">Cork, uncork pretty cool stuff in terms of being able to deal with mass data rights.</span> <span data-start="1221.72" data-end="1229.179">Still, to me, it's too employment Kateed.</span> <span data-start="1229.179" data-end="1235.19">So, the whatWG streams, what they're trying to do is trying to standardize a lot of this</span> <span data-start="1235.19" data-end="1242.85">for lower level APIs for what's going into the browsers, so come nick, who is here\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1242.85" data-end="1250.019">Domnik is here, he's working on that and it's working on lower level IO, and cast which</span> <span data-start="1250.019" data-end="1259.289">means one person reads, one person writes (Uniany cast) can we take and generalize what</span> <span data-start="1259.289" data-end="1265.36">we're trying to do here into a more general kind of thing where we're talking about like</span> <span data-start="1265.36" data-end="1266.36">observables.</span> <span data-start="1266.36" data-end="1272.91">And the answer is yes, and the answer, unfortunately is dart.</span> <span data-start="1272.91" data-end="1278.49">Dart is doing those kind of things where asynchronous programming they do with futures and streams</span> <span data-start="1278.49" data-end="1286.049">automatically, so futures, great, streams, unify.O and vents together.</span> <span data-start="1286.049" data-end="1297.37">So literally, your Oparin (Unify I/O) you can use the same API throughout all of them.</span> <span data-start="1297.37" data-end="1303.499">Now reactive streams is an effort that's going on because a lot of people in the observable</span> <span data-start="1303.499" data-end="1310.269">world say, well you can't do back pressure, can you? Because I mean come on you deal with</span> <span data-start="1310.269" data-end="1317.42">a lot of people handling your data, we can't possibly\h‑‑ we can't possibly know how</span> <span data-start="1317.42" data-end="1318.73">to deal with this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1318.73" data-end="1324.82">You know, a node and others have it very easy where you have one coming in, one going out</span> <span data-start="1324.82" data-end="1329.049">that if you kind of crimp the hose, that's fine, no big deal.</span> <span data-start="1329.049" data-end="1335.269">But when you're dealing with a multi‑cast situation, it kind of is a big deal.</span> <span data-start="1335.269" data-end="1339.7">With observables we have notions of back pressure, they could be lassi, possible, sampling throttling,</span> <span data-start="1339.7" data-end="1350.35">they could be lossless, so I could pauseble buffer, pause and resume, or control, so for</span> <span data-start="1350.35" data-end="1356.96">example here, I can take my chatty observable, pauseble buffer it, then pause and resume,</span> <span data-start="1356.96" data-end="1362.049">and anything that happened in between the pause and resume I still get.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1362.049" data-end="1367.429">And just as well while we're building it into the very core part each subscription will</span> <span data-start="1367.429" data-end="1373.559">be able to say I want to request "N" number of items, so once again back pressure is something</span> <span data-start="1373.559" data-end="1377.539">that we have definitely under our belt.</span> <span data-start="1377.539" data-end="1384.48">Now where do we go from here? I think there's actually a lot of places we can go because</span> <span data-start="1384.48" data-end="1391.1">of the fact that Async away\h‑‑ all these things are pushing the envelope.</span> <span data-start="1391.1" data-end="1397.72">And that's really cool thing, but what if we could go even further? So in: Seven Jafar</span> <span data-start="1397.72" data-end="1408.66">Husain a member of the ES 39 communication committee proposed Async generators in which</span> <span data-start="1408.66" data-end="1417.73">we could take that very same mouse/drag and put it into the for/on kind of syntax so you</span> <span data-start="1417.73" data-end="1425.129">could say let mouse donee down on element mouse down, that first class object, document.mouse</span> <span data-start="1425.129" data-end="1432.47">move, first class object, taken till document.mouse ups, yield the mouse move.</span> <span data-start="1432.47" data-end="1434.25">Good.</span> <span data-start="1434.25" data-end="1440.32">So that to me is very, very interesting and I think there are a lot of places that we</span> <span data-start="1440.32" data-end="1442.72">can go with these kinds of approaches.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1442.72" data-end="1445.239">So ..</span> <span data-start="1445.239" data-end="1450.139">I will be upstairs if anyone has any questions or if anyone wants an RX sticker come find</span> </p>
