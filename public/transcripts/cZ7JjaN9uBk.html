data-start="1551.1" data-end="1555.84">into your phone anyone is trying it okay</span> <span data-start="1555.84" data-end="1557.94">as if we should should I should have</span> <span data-start="1557.94" data-end="1570.22">made it to our L but</span> <span data-start="1570.23" data-end="1580.23">who was that nice or nice i'm not going</span> <span data-start="1580.23" data-end="1584.85">to be good follow up shortly we could</span> <span data-start="1584.85" data-end="1586.769">attach it to a laser i don't know i'm</span> <span data-start="1586.769" data-end="1603.56">not only didn't of course yeah</span> <span data-start="1603.57" data-end="1605.67">so you can literally build any kind of</span> <span data-start="1605.67" data-end="1608.67">eps controlling controlling hardware of</span> <span data-start="1608.67" data-end="1610.29">course this is like prototyping and this</span> <span data-start="1610.29" data-end="1612.09">you wouldn't really use this at home</span> <span data-start="1612.09" data-end="1614.91">unless you're crazy a little bit but if</span> <span data-start="1614.91" data-end="1616.11">you think about it you can actually</span> <span data-start="1616.11" data-end="1617.94">build hardware now and and control it</span> <span data-start="1617.94" data-end="1620.16">with JavaScript and that's that's</span> <span data-start="1620.16" data-end="1621.78">something which which is very exciting i</span> <span data-start="1621.78" data-end="1622.8">find because we're just getting into a</span> <span data-start="1622.8" data-end="1624.9">whole new you sort of area of java</span> <span data-start="1624.9" data-end="1627.69">development which we haven't really done</span> <span data-start="1627.69" data-end="1632.46">before did anyone else connect to it did</span> <span data-start="1632.46" data-end="1644.87">it work how cool yes someone is blocking</span> <span data-start="1644.88" data-end="1650.559">yeah okay so just a few more info if you</span> <span data-start="1650.559" data-end="1652.03">want to get started we actually have a</span> <span data-start="1652.03" data-end="1653.919">couple of boards here and I think it</span> <span data-start="1653.919" data-end="1655.99">would be really really cool to to solder</span> <span data-start="1655.99" data-end="1659.44">a je s conf logo in using LEDs and then</span> <span data-start="1659.44" data-end="1661">make it blink or whatever with a nice</span> <span data-start="1661" data-end="1663.159">interface maybe we can do it later we</span> <span data-start="1663.159" data-end="1664.84">can see but basically if you want to get</span> <span data-start="1664.84" data-end="1666.909">started with the Arduino just check out</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1666.909" data-end="1668.98">Audrina dot CC it's a really cheap board</span> <span data-start="1668.98" data-end="1670.84">it's like 30 30 years or something you</span> <span data-start="1670.84" data-end="1672.159">can order it online and then just get</span> <span data-start="1672.159" data-end="1675.58">started right away notes here is on get</span> <span data-start="1675.58" data-end="1678.4">up so you can just plug that into your</span> <span data-start="1678.4" data-end="1679.929">note instance and then get rolling with</span> <span data-start="1679.929" data-end="1683.46">that we use socket i/o awesome for the</span> <span data-start="1683.46" data-end="1685.929">socket work and that's basically it</span> <span data-start="1685.929" data-end="1688.57">really took took a couple of days or a</span> <span data-start="1688.57" data-end="1690.49">couple of hours we need to actually put</span> <span data-start="1690.49" data-end="1691.87">everything together the biggest</span> <span data-start="1691.87" data-end="1694.78">challenge was the 220 volt kind of kind</span> <span data-start="1694.78" data-end="1696.549">of part because there was a bit scary</span> <span data-start="1696.549" data-end="1698.5">and you don't really want to play with</span> <span data-start="1698.5" data-end="1702.49">the electricity I think the source code</span> <span data-start="1702.49" data-end="1705.76">for arduino Jas is on github as well you</span> <span data-start="1705.76" data-end="1707.89">can just fork it and extend it and just</span> <span data-start="1707.89" data-end="1709.809">try it out it makes it super easy to</span> <span data-start="1709.809" data-end="1711.1">start doing these kind of things</span> <span data-start="1711.1" data-end="1718.36">basically so yeah yeah I mean we need</span> <span data-start="1718.36" data-end="1721.51">some pie charts of course and Patrick so</span> <span data-start="1721.51" data-end="1725.02">in 2009 at the jas comp in DC not</span> <span data-start="1725.02" data-end="1726.64">specially all client side JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1726.64" data-end="1730.51">check right Jojo whatever so we've got</span> <span data-start="1730.51" data-end="1733.539">moved on a bit last year here in

data-end="1781.139">have a soldering iron if anyone really</span> <span data-start="1781.139" data-end="1782.7">wants to start solving some stuff we can</span> <span data-start="1782.7" data-end="1785.459">we can do it LEDs and everything if</span> <span data-start="1785.459" data-end="1787.649">anyone actually knows how to do electric</span> <span data-start="1787.649" data-end="1789.119">stuff because I actually don't really</span> <span data-start="1789.119" data-end="1791.759">know it I was just putting the cables</span> <span data-start="1791.759"

data-start="1878.97" data-end="1882.13">absolutely i mean you can do it there's</span> <span data-start="1882.13" data-end="1883.63">a whole bunch of libraries for the other</span> <span data-start="1883.63" data-end="1887.8">video which you can use actually I I set</span> <span data-start="1887.8" data-end="1889.63">up bluetooth as well so you can just</span> <span data-start="1889.63" data-end="1892">connect from your phone directly to the</span> <span data-start="1892" data-end="1893.26">board to bluetooth it's just really</span> <span data-start="1893.26"

data-end="1909.19">build a home network with the sender</span> <span data-start="1909.19" data-end="1911.76">that I connected a little white wireless</span> <span data-start="1911.76" data-end="1914.62">there's two protocols zigbee and</span> <span data-start="1914.62" data-end="1915.94">satellite that may be interesting to</span> <span data-start="1915.94" data-end="1918.85">look at both had some weaknesses zigbee</span> <span data-start="1918.85" data-end="1920.47">is not the standard that wave it's not</span> <span data-start="1920.47" data-end="1924.22">but the harbor's

interact</span> <span data-start="1927.55" data-end="1929.62">with JavaScript of these mass protocols</span> <span data-start="1929.62" data-end="1931.15">because the interesting thing there's</span> <span data-start="1931.15" data-end="1933.37">you can Absalom this here and then there</span> <span data-start="1933.37" data-end="1935.65">and the range from my controller to the</span> <span data-start="1935.65" data-end="1937.57">last tender would be too long that they</span> <span data-start="1937.57" data-end="1939.55">can connect using other nodes in the</span> <span data-start="1939.55" data-end="1942.25">network without actually other access</span> <span data-start="1942.25" data-end="1943.99">points which is really interesting for</span> <span
