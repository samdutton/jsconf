<p><span data-start="33.77" data-end="38.039">I've got a wife and two kids, and they were lucky enough to come along with us on the</span> <span data-start="38.039" data-end="40.3">trip here today.</span> <span data-start="40.3" data-end="46.309">And any time I go on a work conference, my wife calls it a work vacation.</span> <span data-start="46.309" data-end="50.87">So I always explain, no, it's  —  we're actually, we're learning, it's, you know, very dedicated,</span> <span data-start="50.87" data-end="57.17">we are spending a lot of learning new technologies, not learning people, so when we're driving</span> <span data-start="57.17" data-end="62.449">up to the resort yesterday and we saw the palm trees and the beautiful son, I think</span> <span data-start="62.449" data-end="68.63">the confirmation bias set in and this is in fact a work vacation.</span> <span data-start="68.63" data-end="69.63"Audience member: She needs a vacation.</span> <span data-start="69.63" data-end="70.63"Audience member: Well.</span> <span data-start="70.63" data-end="73.59">She's at the beach today.</span> <span data-start="73.59" data-end="76.29"Audience member: So just a little bit about Bryan and myself.</span> <span data-start="76.29" data-end="80.24">Buyian is a software lead at Lockheed Martin.</span> <span data-start="80.24" data-end="84.35">He's been developing software for pretty much his whole life but over the last 20 years,</span> <span data-start="84.35" data-end="90.34">really as a lead developer, chief architect of a lot of cool systems.</span> <span data-start="90.34" data-end="96.97">He is really the driving force, like the conductor and really the engine to drive a lot of our</span> <span data-start="96.97" data-end="102.28">programs forward and that's where my train analogy runs out of steam.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="102.28" data-end="108.35">Myself, I'm a DevOps tech lead which means that I'm not good as a developer and not good</span> <span data-start="108.35" data-end="115.64">at relations, but what I'm really good at is to be able to enable developers to be the</span> <span data-start="115.64" data-end="122.61">best at what they're at and for humans it is being creative and we're best at solving</span> <span data-start="122.61" data-end="127.6">problems and a problem we're not really good at solving is doing repetitive tasks over</span> <span data-start="127.6" data-end="132.82">and over again.</span> <span data-start="132.82" data-end="138.16">I take a lot of joy in automating all of those things, so that the creative people, especially</span> <span data-start="138.16" data-end="141.22">like Bryan, can do what they're best at.</span> <span data-start="141.22" data-end="147.409"Audience member: Yeah, DevOps makes our life better, absolutely.</span> <span data-start="147.409" data-end="153.15"Audience member: Andy: I little bit more on the personal side.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="153.15" data-end="156.78">And to highlight how we're opposites.</span> <span data-start="156.78" data-end="166.07">I live in Upstate New York and that means that I enjoy winter and I have two small humans</span> <span data-start="166.07" data-end="169.16">as roommates and like I mentioned, they're at the beach today.</span> <span data-start="169.16" data-end="175.2">They say that you should try everything at least once once in life just to see what it's</span> <span data-start="175.2" data-end="176.2">like.</span> <span data-start="176.2" data-end="179.4">I've done the science on this next one, you guys  —  don't get hit by a car.</span> <span data-start="179.4" data-end="182.98">It's not so much fun.</span> <span data-start="182.98" data-end="185.01">And am primarily a carnivore.</span> <span data-start="185.01" data-end="192.81"Audience member: Bryan: For myself, I live in Los Angeles, where we experience zero months of winter</span> <span data-start="192.81" data-end="193.93">each year.</span> <span data-start="193.93" data-end="202.32">I live near a beach, Venice Beach, I have two roommates, wife and dog and I've been</span> <span data-start="202.32" data-end="205.959">hit by zero cars, a much better experience.</span> <span data-start="205.959" data-end="212.45">Herbivore, so no meat and what we can both agree on it beer and coffee.</span> <span data-start="212.45" data-end="214.25"Audience member: Andy: I think that's what make us such great friends.</span> <span data-start="214.25" data-end="215.25"Audience member: Bryan: That's right.</span> <span data-start="215.25" data-end="219.98"Audience member: Andy: So why are you here?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="219.98" data-end="223.04">Primarily to see us make fools of ourselves.</span> <span data-start="223.04" data-end="227.1">Bryan called me up a few months and said hey, why don't you come to Southern California</span> <span data-start="227.1" data-end="235.03">and go to a conference and a couple weeks later I said, hey, Bryan, why don't we present</span> <span data-start="235.03" data-end="237.46">at that conference.</span> <span data-start="237.46" data-end="240.04">So a few of the technologies we use for yoga possess.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="240.04" data-end="249.57">Node.js, I don't think they'd let us in the door if we didn't use.</span> <span data-start="249.57" data-end="257.799"Audience member: React, TensorFlow one of the fun toys that we don't get to play a whole lot with our</span> <span data-start="257.799" data-end="260.34">day jobs.</span> <span data-start="260.34" data-end="265.26">Some pose estimation that happens in real time in the browser and then some of the deployment</span> <span data-start="265.26" data-end="269.57">things that I find pretty interesting.</span> <span data-start="269.57" data-end="281.07"Audience member: Bryan: So React, yes, the one with hooks, really great if new tech in 16: 8 I'm sure</span> <span data-start="281.07" data-end="285.09">you've seen a lot of those, and great, we're moving over to hooks, we're going to use hooks</span> <span data-start="285.09" data-end="286.82">for this whole thing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="286.82" data-end="297.78">Look how great use state is and then I'm off using use effect and then I want to share</span> <span data-start="297.78" data-end="303.03">some global states and now I'm using use context and then I have this mutable thing that I</span> <span data-start="303.03" data-end="313.34">want to keep track of and so now I'm into useRef and then you want to use the set interval.</span> <span data-start="313.34" data-end="316.13">So you're using a custom hook called useInterval.</span> <span data-start="316.13" data-end="318.75">And it's super interesting.</span> <span data-start="318.75" data-end="327.32">Dan wrote a blogpost on how it can be used instead of set interval.</span> <span data-start="327.32" data-end="334.15"Audience member: Yeah, it's really interesting how the underlying hook technology allows you to take the ones</span> <span data-start="334.15" data-end="336.59">that React has published and use them.</span> <span data-start="336.59" data-end="341.05">But also extend them in ways that you can be creative about and find new uses about,</span> <span data-start="341.05" data-end="344.669">like the one that Dan published for handling intervals.</span> <span data-start="344.669" data-end="351.93">TensorFlow, how many people have heard of TensorFlow?</span> <span data-start="351.93" data-end="352.93">Several.</span> <span data-start="352.93" data-end="355.43">How many have used it before?</span> <span data-start="355.43" data-end="357.56">Fewer, great.</span> <span data-start="357.56" data-end="360.65">So TensorFlow.js is cool.</span> <span data-start="360.65" data-end="368.34">It allows you to train and deploy models in a browser or in a node environment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="368.34" data-end="370.81">I think it makes machine learning easy.</span> <span data-start="370.81" data-end="377.09">We work with a lot of data scientists, and they're really big nerds and they make machine</span> <span data-start="377.09" data-end="381.76">learning actually easy, like the things that they do is really impressive and it makes</span> <span data-start="381.76" data-end="387.53">our life as more front-end and application developers, easy to take what they've done</span> <span data-start="387.53" data-end="392.85">and really just implement it, so it was fun for us to jump into TensorFlow and actually</span> <span data-start="392.85" data-end="399.84">start playing with some of the models, creating our own and seeing how we can work with them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.84" data-end="402.12">Another great thing about TensorFlow is the docs.</span> <span data-start="402.12" data-end="405.62">There's a handful of tools that I think have really amazing docs.</span> <span data-start="405.62" data-end="408.8">Docker is one of them.</span> <span data-start="408.8" data-end="410.33">TensorFlow had really great docs.</span> <span data-start="410.33" data-end="412.15">Bootstrap is amazing that stuff.</span> <span data-start="412.15" data-end="416.78">So when a tool has really great docs, I think it makes it easier to understand it or at</span> <span data-start="416.78" data-end="420.8">least how to use it.</span> <span data-start="420.8" data-end="428.71"Audience member: Bryan: Specifically out of TensorFlow there's a model called pose net and what it's used</span> <span data-start="428.71" data-end="436.15">for is to determining pose information in real time or you'll feed it a video or image</span> <span data-start="436.15" data-end="440.36">and what that model will give back to you are 17 different body parts, it will show</span> <span data-start="440.36" data-end="448.3">you where somebody's eyes are, where the nose is, shoulders and you can take that pose then</span> <span data-start="448.3" data-end="453.949">and basically run your algorithm against those 17 different body parts to do whatever you</span> <span data-start="453.949" data-end="454.949">want.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.949" data-end="460.24">In our case, we're going to be scoring some yoga poses, but the pretty cool thing about</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="466.38">PoseNet where we get to see the browser and how far it's come is it runs completely in</span> <span data-start="466.38" data-end="472.41">the browser, so there isn't any data being sent out to some external server.</span> <span data-start="472.41" data-end="479.58">That pose estimation, that neural network is all running exclusively with your browser</span> <span data-start="479.58" data-end="488.19">and just use a convolutional neural net to basically return those pose and there's a</span> <span data-start="488.19" data-end="495.5">neural net under the hood that's using to determine oh, a human is in this image, these</span> <span data-start="495.5" data-end="503.4">are the parts of that human and then mapping out the XY coordinates that you can then use.</span> <span data-start="503.4" data-end="511.18">Andy: So out of the box, PoseNet ships with a handful of models.</span> <span data-start="511.18" data-end="514.31">It's a mobile mold.</span> <span data-start="514.31" data-end="521.329">It gives a lot less accuracy when coming up with the key point positions and confidence</span> <span data-start="521.329" data-end="523.019">in each of those.</span> <span data-start="523.019" data-end="530.19">There's a beefier one, called ResNet 50 which I really wanted to work and it really crushed</span> <span data-start="530.19" data-end="535.279">the processer, to the point where we were getting like 10 to 15 frames a second, which</span> <span data-start="535.279" data-end="541.769">sucks, so we couldn't go with that one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="541.769" data-end="548.079">So we used mobile net v1.</span> <span data-start="548.079" data-end="553.85">Then like Bryan mentioned, out of the box it can detect multiple people which is kind</span> <span data-start="553.85" data-end="560.639">of cool and could have some implications for different ways that you could use Posenet.</span> <span data-start="560.639" data-end="567.709">So let's have some fun with the first toy that we created.</span> <span data-start="567.709" data-end="571.22">Face detection and tracking so here's Will with some really cool glasses on.</span> <span data-start="571.22" data-end="575.1">Bryan, I don't know if you want to step out and show some code here.</span> <span data-start="575.1" data-end="577.369"Audience member: Bryan: Absolutely so basically here .. >> Andy: Did you hit the go button?</span> <span data-start="577.369" data-end="578.369">You have to  —  perfect.</span> <span data-start="578.369" data-end="579.369">There we go.</span> <span data-start="579.369" data-end="580.369"Audience member: Bryan: Thank you.</span> <span data-start="580.369" data-end="585.029">Basically see we're grabbing that pose, the pose consists of those  —  I'm 17 points that</span> <span data-start="585.029" data-end="588.899">we talked about before, and we're basically going to go into that pose, look at the key</span> <span data-start="588.899" data-end="596.54">points and say where is the nose, where is the eye, and just do some simple math here</span> <span data-start="596.54" data-end="603.459">to determine how wide the glasses are, we'll do a ratio of the image that we're going to</span> <span data-start="603.459" data-end="604.459">be using.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="604.459" data-end="611.6">We'll do a calculation so just doing the inverse tangent of looking to calculate the angle</span> <span data-start="611.6" data-end="618.089">of the face so we can apply the glasses in the correct orientation and just doing a quick</span> <span data-start="618.089" data-end="625.009">translation based on the nose so we can place them in the correct spot, applying the rotation</span> <span data-start="625.009" data-end="631.379">based on the angle and we're going to draw that image onto the canvas.</span> <span data-start="631.379" data-end="632.709">So what does that look like?</span> <span data-start="632.709" data-end="633.709">Sorry, Andy.</span> <span data-start="633.709" data-end="634.709"Audience member: Andy: Yeah, no worries.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="634.709" data-end="635.709">So you can see we fully embraced the saved by the bell theme here.</span> <span data-start="635.709" data-end="637.939">Do you want to talk about how you added some key press magic here?</span> <span data-start="637.939" data-end="642.35"Audience member: Yeah, so basically what we do, there's Andy.</span> <span data-start="642.35" data-end="649.649">Bryan: We wrapped the Pose net model in the React and basically we're hooking the keyboard</span> <span data-start="649.649" data-end="657.079">and we can do some simple logic to say we want to render this canvas on top of the video</span> <span data-start="657.079" data-end="658.079">we're seeing.</span> <span data-start="658.079" data-end="668.059">This harsh light is a little rough, but  —  hahahaha [applause]</span> <span data-start="668.059" data-end="673.99">Andy: So I think we also learned something pretty important about users by coming here</span> <span data-start="673.99" data-end="675.67">and being on this stage.</span> <span data-start="675.67" data-end="681.199">It's super-easy as developers to build something in a way that you expect your users to interact</span> <span data-start="681.199" data-end="682.459">with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="682.459" data-end="685.529">So for Bryan and I sitting in an office, sitting in our desks in our homes.</span> <span data-start="685.529" data-end="689.699"Audience member: Andy Bryan: Nice ambient lighting Andy: Yeah, and then you come up here and</span> <span data-start="689.699" data-end="696.66">you have white background and harsh lighting so I think it's great to think that users</span> <span data-start="696.66" data-end="702.029">are going to abuse your systems, so here's a great example.</span> <span data-start="702.029" data-end="705.769">There we got Bob there.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="755.04" data-end="762.209">A few other things we did here related to Canvas and also having access to user media</span> <span data-start="762.209" data-end="769.449">is to grab the camera that user might have available.</span> <span data-start="769.449" data-end="775.249">So there's a few different ways that that can be tuned to inspect which devices a user</span> <span data-start="775.249" data-end="782.42">has available to them whether it's a front-facing or rear-facing camera.</span> <span data-start="782.42" data-end="793.579">Bryan: So once you have those 17 key points to actually start being able to understand</span> <span data-start="793.579" data-end="799.639">or how to score how that those body parts are in relation to something else, we need</span> <span data-start="799.639" data-end="805.809">to turn those into vectors, so just basically taking each one of the 17 key points, iterating</span> <span data-start="805.809" data-end="811.949">through those, creating vectors through an additional key point and basically we're creating</span> <span data-start="811.949" data-end="818.189">a bunch of XY vectors in that space that we can start to say, OK, based on this vector,</span> <span data-start="818.189" data-end="822.759">how is it going to compare to some other vector that you're expecting?</span> </p>
