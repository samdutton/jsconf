data-start="164.77" data-end="166.84">and I hope there's some inspiration</span> <span data-start="166.84" data-end="171.58">there for all of us when when I talk</span> <span data-start="171.58" data-end="174.82">about a new way of programming to align</span> <span data-start="174.82" data-end="177.64">these paradigms and more generally</span> <span data-start="177.64" data-end="180.88">execution environments I am referring to</span> <span data-start="180.88" data-end="183.48">something I call the towel model or</span> <span data-start="183.48"

model</span> <span data-start="203.62" data-end="207.19">derives its name from an acronym for the</span> <span data-start="207.19" data-end="209.41">message format to make it easy to</span> <span data-start="209.41" data-end="212.47">remember especially the ordering of the</span> <span data-start="212.47" data-end="217">parts and every message we're used to</span> <span data-start="217" data-end="219.489">messaging that specifies the action or</span> <span data-start="219.489" data-end="227.47">operation but the towel message differs</span> <span data-start="227.47" data-end="230.739">from traditional messaging in a few ways</span> <span data-start="230.739" data-end="232.78">specifically provides three degrees of</span> <span data-start="232.78" data-end="236.53">freedom which will make a lot more sense</span> <span data-start="236.53" data-end="239.709">when you see it using in wildcard</span> <span data-start="239.709" data-end="243.97">handlers also we embed the subject of</span> <span data-start="243.97" data-end="246.16">the message within the message itself</span> <span data-start="246.16" data-end="248.709">whereas most messaging systems or most</span> <span data-start="248.709" data-end="251.62">messaging we're used to this subject is</span> <span data-start="251.62" data-end="253.78">either the source or the destination of</span> <span data-start="253.78" data-end="256.51">the message and the inclusion of a third</span> <span data-start="256.51"

data-end="264.22">application from all angles not just a</span> <span data-start="264.22" data-end="271.39">two-dimensional view so the towel model</span> <span data-start="271.39" data-end="274.06">also provides three distinct ways in</span> <span data-start="274.06" data-end="275.71">which we can attach handlers to our</span> <span data-start="275.71" data-end="278.38">signal
