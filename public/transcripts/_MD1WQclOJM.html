about the work we're doing</span> <span data-start="28.49" data-end="31.07">with CSS modules for those who have</span> <span data-start="31.07" data-end="33.17">already seen this at CSS conf sorry this</span> <span data-start="33.17" data-end="36.05">is basically the same talk I updated a</span> <span data-start="36.05" data-end="38.29">few things based on questions from there</span> <span data-start="38.29" data-end="40.85">so the problem that CSS modules is</span> <span data-start="40.85" data-end="43.01">trying to solve is not a problem that's</span> <span data-start="43.01" data-end="45.559">unique to Google+ or Google it's a</span> <span data-start="45.559" data-end="48.05">problem of all very large applications</span> <span data-start="48.05" data-end="50.449">this is just a sampling of some of the</span> <span data-start="50.449" data-end="52.73">top level pages and within each of these</span> <span data-start="52.73" data-end="55.79">pages we have lots of features and that</span> <span data-start="55.79" data-end="57.619">adds up to lots of JavaScript and CSS</span> <span data-start="57.619" data-end="60.29">and as you can see from these numbers</span> <span data-start="60.29" data-end="64.28">here we have a ton of CSS and we have a</span> <span data-start="64.28" data-end="67.58">problem to solve the other problem that</span> <span data-start="67.58" data-end="70.22">module system addresses is a problem</span> <span data-start="70.22" data-end="71.78">that almost everybody struggles with</span> <span data-start="71.78" data-end="76.82">which is writing maintainable CSS and we</span> <span data-start="76.82" data-end="79.1">have both of these problems in Google+ a</span> <span data-start="79.1" data-end="83.24">lot of CSS too big too slow and since we</span> <span data-start="83.24" data-end="85.67">are manually curating our CSS in our</span> <span data-start="85.67" data-end="88.04">build files it's brittle and prone to</span> <span data-start="88.04" data-end="90.32">reordering when developers refactor</span> <span data-start="90.32" data-end="93.23">their code so this has resulted in many</span> <span data-start="93.23" data-end="95.96">broken you I regressions in our QA and</span> <span data-start="95.96" data-end="98.57">because developers cannot rely on a</span> <span data-start="98.57" data-end="101.39">deterministic cascade order they have to</span> <span data-start="101.39" data-end="104.33">resort to things like specificity which</span> <span data-start="104.33" data-end="107.48">gets ugly so this talk is about the</span> <span data-start="107.48" data-end="109.58">module system that we've developed the</span> <span data-start="109.58" data-end="112.49">primary goal being CSS size initial load</span> <span data-start="112.49" data-end="116.27">time building a body will system is a</span> <span data-start="116.27" data-end="117.83">lot more straightforward if you have</span> <span data-start="117.83" data-end="120.229">absolutely no shared code at all let's</span> <span data-start="120.229" data-end="121.88">say we didn't share any code between our</span> <span data-start="121.88" data-end="124.31">pages on Google+ then you could simply</span> <span data-start="124.31" data-end="126.229">make each page a module and download it</span> <span data-start="126.229" data-end="128.269">and it's much more straightforward but</span> <span data-start="128.269" data-end="130.25">in reality we have a lot of shared</span> <span data-start="130.25" data-end="132.08">styles and if you don't have a lot of</span> <span data-start="132.08" data-end="133.97">shared styles on your site you're doing</span> <span data-start="133.97" data-end="137.51">something wrong so we had to develop a</span> <span data-start="137.51" data-end="139.519">dependency system to handle this and</span> <span data-start="139.519" data-end="142.67">that itself has been a huge win and it's</span> <span data-start="142.67" data-end="144.67">really improved developer productivity</span> <span data-start="144.67" data-end="147.86">because now our developers can rely on</span> <span data-start="147.86" data-end="150.5">this deterministic cascade and not be</span> <span data-start="150.5" data-end="152.989">fighting specificity so we haven't</span> <span data-start="152.989" data-end="155.989">launched this a module system fully to</span> <span data-start="155.989" data-end="158.03">our entire site we have launched it</span> <span data-start="158.03" data-end="160.52">pages and we've seen significant</span> <span data-start="160.52" data-end="162.77">performance improvement in terms of CSS</span> <span data-start="162.77" data-end="167.48">size the GSS the CSS preprocessor we use</span> <span data-start="167.48"

GSS in this presentation I</span> <span data-start="174.92" data-end="180.26">really mean CSS so we've said that when</span> <span data-start="180.26" data-end="181.88">you know we have shared code we want a</span> <span data-start="181.88" data-end="183.77">dependency system but to build an</span> <span data-start="183.77" data-end="186.05">effective dependency system you have to</span> <span data-start="186.05" data-end="189.319">know what the shared code is and this is</span> <span data-start="189.319" data-end="191.48">not always obvious for a really large</span> <span data-start="191.48" data-end="194.15">site you might notice that there is some</span> <span data-start="194.15" data-end="196.28">similarity between a button and a menu</span> <span

data-start="201.38" data-end="203.959">are a lot of repeating UI elements in a</span> <span data-start="203.959" data-end="206.6">lot of sites and we have a ton of these</span> <span

has the list of modules that you</span> <span data-start="1423.34" data-end="1427.24">need to show that page and then on the</span> <span data-start="1427.24" data-end="1429.4">server the list of modules gets</span> <span data-start="1429.4" data-end="1431.71">concatenated down to a single response</span> <span data-start="1431.71" data-end="1434.49">and so you're serving a single response</span> <span data-start="1434.49" data-end="1438.52">and again the next page if you go visit</span> <span data-start="1438.52" data-end="1440.62">another page because you have stayed

data-start="1456.85" data-end="1459.58">problem of oh I'm on my next page and</span> <span data-start="1459.58" data-end="1461.77">the new styles of the community page are</span> <span
