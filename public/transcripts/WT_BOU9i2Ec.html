data-end="77.67">said that we are currently reaching the</span> <span data-start="77.67" data-end="80.75">limits of the possibilities to render</span> <span data-start="80.75" data-end="83.88">simply render graphics using the</span> <span data-start="83.88" data-end="87.99">traditional methods so what are the</span> <span data-start="87.99" data-end="90.29">traditional methods well obviously</span> <span data-start="90.29" data-end="92.299">traditional methods are rendering using</span> <span data-start="92.299" data-end="96.299">polygons which are just a tiny triangles</span> <span data-start="96.299" data-end="98.94">and polygons are cool</span> <span data-start="98.94" data-end="103.26">because this hardware is optimized to</span> <span data-start="103.26" data-end="105.99">render using polygons also the polygons</span> <span data-start="105.99" data-end="109.41">are really nice big to show uniform</span> <span data-start="109.41" data-end="111.84">uniform surfaces but they suck at</span> <span data-start="111.84" data-end="117.66">complicated scene so a karmic decided to</span> <span data-start="117.66" data-end="119.97">go that bit different way and he</span> <span data-start="119.97" data-end="121.53">introduced voxels well nothing</span> <span data-start="121.53" data-end="123.78">introduced but he said he in the next</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="125.94">engine she's gonna render the scenes</span> <span data-start="125.94" data-end="129">using voxels and factories so forces are</span> <span data-start="129" data-end="131.76">just small cube so we just move the</span> <span data-start="131.76" data-end="135.06">pixel in 3d dimension trading a tiny</span> <span data-start="135.06"

of trouble with this technique</span> <span data-start="145.07" data-end="146.99">implementation is pretty straightforward</span> <span data-start="146.99" data-end="149.18">traversing the trees very easy</span> <span data-start="149.18" data-end="152.49">collisions are easy resolution change is</span> <span data-start="152.49" data-end="155.88">easy we have possibility generate sparse</span> <span data-start="155.88" data-end="159.54">voxel tree so the nodes of our tree that</span> <span data-start="159.54" data-end="161.31">don't contain data that need to be</span> <span data-start="161.31" data-end="165.63">rendered are just not shown it's really</span> <span data-start="165.63" data-end="168.93">easy to hide surfaces that we're not</span> <span data-start="168.93" data-end="172.11">showing there are many possibilities to</span> <span data-start="172.11" data-end="174.12">improve because the topic is not as much</span> <span data-start="174.12" data-end="176.85">research as the polygon generation but</span> <span data-start="176.85" data-end="180.239">there are a lot of cons so first thing</span> <span data-start="180.239" data-end="181.86">she can be expensive because if you move</span> <span data-start="181.86" data-end="184.62">if you start from the not from the</span> <span data-start="184.62" data-end="187.26">correct point you just can move back and</span> <span data-start="187.26" data-end="190.23">forth across the tree and this can be</span> <span data-start="190.23" data-end="192.86">really expensive and time-consuming</span> <span data-start="192.86" data-end="196.68">animations suck we'll just think about</span> <span data-start="196.68" data-end="200.64">moving 5 million or 50 millions of atoms</span> <span data-start="200.64" data-end="204.269">at a time across the tree structure it</span> <span data-start="204.269" data-end="206.91">really suck at the moment but will check</span> <span data-start="206.91" data-end="209.1">about that later and size doesn't matter</span> <span data-start="209.1" data-end="212.03">unfortunately storing data in an octree</span> <span data-start="212.03" data-end="217.22">44 voxel it's really sighs consuming so</span> <span data-start="217.22" data-end="219.87">let's proceed so first we dig into all</span> <span data-start="219.87" data-end="222.59">trees basically oak trees are just</span> <span data-start="222.59" data-end="225.75">trimmed with data presentation which</span> <span data-start="225.75" data-end="227.86">device divides the</span> <span data-start="227.86" data-end="232.54">the special into small box when each</span> <span data-start="232.54" data-end="234.94">book consists of eight children and so</span> <span data-start="234.94" data-end="238.87">on and so on and so on and this house</span> <span data-start="238.87" data-end="239.89">knows basically some pretty</span> <span data-start="239.89" data-end="242.38">straightforward I live third where you</span> <span data-start="242.38" data-end="246.34">can get it and how implemented it well</span> <span data-start="246.34" data-end="248.71">to be honest I just went through like</span> <span data-start="248.71" data-end="251.32">thousands of different codes to a lot of</span> <span data-start="251.32" data-end="253.24">different implementations in C in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.24" data-end="255.64">JavaScript there is I believe only one</span> <span data-start="255.64" data-end="257.95">implementation JavaScript but I wasn't</span> <span data-start="257.95" data-end="260.049">able to contact the outer so I'm not</span> <span data-start="260.049" data-end="263.05">sure how it works he just states that it</span> <span data-start="263.05" data-end="268.03">does so old after that I went to check</span> <span data-start="268.03" data-end="270.01">the implementations of quad risk or</span> <span data-start="270.01" data-end="273.37">basically just the same idea but still I</span> <span data-start="273.37" data-end="275.11">wasn't able to find anything interesting</span> <span data-start="275.11" data-end="279.34">in there so after skimming through some</span> <span data-start="279.34" data-end="282.28">sickos C++ code I was able to come up</span> <span data-start="282.28" data-end="284.47">with a solution of my own solution which</span> <span data-start="284.47" data-end="288.01">is not over complicated and it worked so</span> <span data-start="288.01" data-end="291.58">basically that's the up three object as</span> <span data-start="291.58" data-end="294.729">you can see we have the node which is</span> <span data-start="294.729" data-end="298.26">the root of over over three structure</span> <span data-start="298.26" data-end="300.94">the road can't the root can contain</span> <span data-start="300.94" data-end="304.33">shape if you just have one level we have</span> <span data-start="304.33" data-end="307.84">also position over root we have also</span> <span data-start="307.84" data-end="311.8">type which is a bit not useful here okay</span> <span data-start="311.8" data-end="315.43">maybe it is the length of the wall which</span> <span data-start="315.43" data-end="318.19">gives us the size of the whole space and</span> <span data-start="318.19" data-end="320.169">the depth and the max depth which are</span> <span data-start="320.169" data-end="322.87">useful when traversing when adding and</span> <span data-start="322.87" data-end="326.26">etcetera etcetera so following now</span> <span data-start="326.26" data-end="328.63">denote the law basically is just the</span> <span data-start="328.63" data-end="333.34">same it differs with having nodes</span> <span data-start="333.34" data-end="335.29">reference which is a reference to an</span> <span data-start="335.29" data-end="338.68">array that contains the child node of</span> <span data-start="338.68" data-end="343.05">the root of the node which can be either</span> <span data-start="343.05" data-end="346.48">another note or can be</span> <span data-start="346.48" data-end="348.97">the stuff that will be rendering during</span> <span data-start="348.97" data-end="352.27">our scene and the data that will be</span> <span data-start="352.27" data-end="355.09">rendered I just stored in a flat array</span> <span data-start="355.09" data-end="356.86">because it faster to traverse roof run</span> <span data-start="356.86" data-end="358.95">away then going through the whole tree</span> <span data-start="358.95" data-end="362.53">it also has a parent reference because</span> <span data-start="362.53" data-end="364.63">it's faster to it give us really a boost</span> <span data-start="364.63" data-end="368.98">when the traversing girl Rory a location</span> <span data-start="368.98" data-end="370.33">which is the real magic here the real</span> <span data-start="370.33" data-end="375.42">deal okay now location I needed a way to</span> <span data-start="375.42" data-end="378.7">find my find the note i'm currently</span> <span data-start="378.7" data-end="381.31">dealing with and across the whole</span> <span data-start="381.31" data-end="386.22">structure and it had to be fixed because</span> <span data-start="386.22" data-end="389.41">basically we don't wanna guess in which</span> <span data-start="389.41" data-end="391.75">note we are so i went the bitwise like</span> <span data-start="391.75" data-end="397">idea where the note the the position of</span> <span data-start="397" data-end="399.58">the note inside the parent node it's</span> <span data-start="399.58" data-end="404.89">just defined by a difference on XY and z</span> <span data-start="404.89" data-end="408.01">axis so in all this further than half of</span> <span data-start="408.01" data-end="411.58">the length of XY or z axis we just said</span> <span data-start="411.58" data-end="414.49">to know set the beach one and if it's</span> <span data-start="414.49" data-end="416.8">closer to point zero zero just set the</span> <span data-start="416.8" data-end="419.89">bit to 0 0 to 0 and this gives us a</span> <span data-start="419.89" data-end="424.42">uniform distribution it's the same</span> <span data-start="424.42" data-end="428.59">across the hall the node so just the</span> <span data-start="428.59" data-end="433.27">ticket program now change the rest of</span> <span data-start="433.27" data-end="436.57">location magic I'm not really going into</span> <span data-start="436.57" data-end="441.04">the bit bitwise bitwise where it was bit</span> <span data-start="441.04" data-end="444.88">kinda start and so I decided to just set</span> <span data-start="444.88" data-end="446.89">the position and save the position as a</span> <span data-start="446.89" data-end="451.57">string as a triple of Charles so just</span> <span data-start="451.57" data-end="454.09">traversing deeper into the tree I just</span> <span data-start="454.09" data-end="456.48">add the current position</span> <span data-start="456.48" data-end="460.21">of my note inside the parental so just</span> <span data-start="460.21" data-end="461.92">as you can see in the no list for</span> <span data-start="461.92" data-end="465.52">example the first node in the in the</span> <span data-start="465.52" data-end="467.56">array then the second node we just start</span> <span data-start="467.56" data-end="470.38">with 0 0 0 and so on and so on we just</span> <span data-start="470.38" data-end="471.9">go deeper and deeper and deeper and</span> <span data-start="471.9" data-end="475.51">finally adding the the triples of</span> <span data-start="475.51" data-end="478.3">strings we just end with the correct</span> <span data-start="478.3" data-end="481.36">position of over note inside the whole</span> <span data-start="481.36" data-end="487.51">oak tree now some code for way it's not</span> <span data-start="487.51" data-end="489.79">maybe too obvious but I really try to</span> <span data-start="489.79" data-end="492.76">keep it simple mmm the recursive adding</span> <span data-start="492.76" data-end="495.13">of course we there are different</span> <span data-start="495.13" data-end="496.9">approaches but the recursion is the</span> <span data-start="496.9" data-end="500.56">easiest to just show you so we just</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="500.56" data-end="503.68">Traverse across we just Traverse across</span> <span data-start="503.68" data-end="511.479">the the oak tree we have to as you can</span> <span data-start="511.479" data-end="514.15">see here current location in our equal</span> <span data-start="514.15" data-end="516.07">string location and current depth is not</span> <span data-start="516.07" data-end="520.909">equal string depth so these are the two</span> <span data-start="520.919" data-end="525.33">the two operations that limit our as</span> <span data-start="525.33" data-end="528.04">approach the travas traversing so for</span> <span data-start="528.04" data-end="532.24">example 48 level 3 unless the current</span> <span data-start="532.24" data-end="536.5">location is equal to 8 times 3 / 111 we</span> <span data-start="536.5" data-end="538.6">just reverse deeper and deeper if the</span> <span data-start="538.6" data-end="540.67">current depth is not equal desired depth</span> <span data-start="540.67" data-end="543.91">you just go and add our node in the</span> <span data-start="543.91" data-end="546.78">correct way so how the function for</span> <span data-start="546.78" data-end="550.18">inserting looks like well it's pretty</span> <span data-start="550.18" data-end="553.5">straightforward we just divide the</span> <span data-start="553.5" data-end="555.94">string of location in two triples once</span> <span data-start="555.94" data-end="560.62">again and just following the idea I told</span> <span data-start="560.62" data-end="562.96">you about before we just select the</span> <span data-start="562.96" data-end="566.05">correct we just first okay with vesicles</span> <span data-start="566.05" data-end="569.38">we need to recalculate the position from</span> <span data-start="569.38" data-end="572.17">string to integer from bitwise to</span> <span data-start="572.17" data-end="574.579">integer then we can go through</span> <span data-start="574.579" data-end="577.279">the nodes selecting each node and we</span> <span data-start="577.279" data-end="579.799">when we down we just add node set the</span> <span data-start="579.799" data-end="583.009">values and that's all so the last</span> <span data-start="583.009" data-end="584.929">interesting function here is for</span> <span data-start="584.929" data-end="589.579">retrieving the node is we also reduce</span> <span data-start="589.579" data-end="592.67">recursion here and we can use make the</span> <span data-start="592.67" data-end="596.35">usage of the bit presentation so we just</span> <span data-start="596.35"
