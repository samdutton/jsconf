<p><span data-start="26.939" data-end="29.76">I was building a mobile site and I kept</span> <span data-start="29.76" data-end="31.289">hearing about keyboard accessibility</span> <span data-start="31.289" data-end="33.42">it's like how does this apply to the</span> <span data-start="33.42" data-end="35.43">thing that I'm building so I felt there</span> <span data-start="35.43" data-end="38.7">was this huge gap between my product and</span> <span data-start="38.7" data-end="41.19">accessibility and looking back now that</span> <span data-start="41.19" data-end="43.17">I kind of work on this I'm kind of</span> <span data-start="43.17" data-end="45.39">embarrassed about having been there but</span> <span data-start="45.39" data-end="47.19">it's at the same time I like to fully</span> <span data-start="47.19" data-end="49.26">own having felt that way because it's</span> <span data-start="49.26" data-end="51.449">it's helped me appreciate just how easy</span> <span data-start="51.449" data-end="53.34">it is to feel that way there's no shame</span> <span data-start="53.34" data-end="56.16">in it and and yeah just the fact that</span> <span data-start="56.16" data-end="57.719">accessibility seems to be very far away</span> <span data-start="57.719" data-end="60.18">but it's not it's not really that far so</span> <span data-start="60.18" data-end="62.699">fast forward a few years I'm working at</span> <span data-start="62.699" data-end="65.189">the Financial Times we since last year</span> <span data-start="65.189" data-end="67.02">we were building the fastest greatest</span> <span data-start="67.02" data-end="70.22">new site in the industry we released it</span> <span data-start="70.22" data-end="72.72">about a year ago I was great</span> <span data-start="72.72" data-end="75.59">successfully braced replace an old</span> <span data-start="75.59" data-end="78.72">monolithic web site and we started</span> <span data-start="78.72" data-end="80.61">winning all these words and excelling in</span> <span data-start="80.61" data-end="82.799">performance and security basically every</span> <span data-start="82.799" data-end="84.93">metric that we had set our sights on we</span> <span data-start="84.93" data-end="87.63">were sending on so one day we decided to</span> <span data-start="87.63" data-end="89.1">look at accessibility maybe we were</span> <span data-start="89.1" data-end="91.229">excelling at this to kind of like by</span> <span data-start="91.229" data-end="93.81">magic but unlike performance and</span> <span data-start="93.81" data-end="95.31">security we'd never really put a</span> <span data-start="95.31" data-end="97.59">collective effort into accessibility so</span> <span data-start="97.59" data-end="99.689">to no surprise we weren't very good and</span> <span data-start="99.689" data-end="102.15">that since this talk is going to be all</span> <span data-start="102.15" data-end="103.95">about the lessons that we learned that</span> <span data-start="103.95" data-end="106.189">was really the first the very first one</span> <span data-start="106.189" data-end="108.659">feasibility doesn't just happen you have</span> <span data-start="108.659" data-end="110.909">to make it happen</span> <span data-start="110.909" data-end="112.86">my name is Laura Carvajal I'm Smith</span> <span data-start="112.86" data-end="115.049">developer at the Financial Times this is</span> <span data-start="115.049" data-end="116.399">an actual picture of our office in</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="158.14" data-end="159.909">I'm gonna read out to you web</span> <span data-start="159.909" data-end="161.62">accessibility means that people with</span> <span data-start="161.62" data-end="163.92">disabilities can use the web that's it</span> <span data-start="163.92" data-end="166.54">it boils it down to making sure that</span> <span data-start="166.54" data-end="169.51">we're not denying access to anyone to</span> <span data-start="169.51" data-end="171.639">the thing that we're building but I want</span> <span data-start="171.639" data-end="173.23">to go a little bit deeper if you allow</span> <span data-start="173.23" data-end="175.29">me I want to tell you a quick story I</span> <span data-start="175.29" data-end="177.849">was in a shopping mall in London while</span> <span data-start="177.849" data-end="181.12">back and we were I was with my daughter</span> <span data-start="181.12" data-end="182.68">we were going up those escalators and</span> <span data-start="182.68" data-end="185.319">and she asked me how does someone in a</span> <span data-start="185.319" data-end="187.329">wheelchair do what we're doing and she's</span> <span data-start="187.329" data-end="188.889">she's only ten but she's very aware of</span> <span data-start="188.889" data-end="190.93">accessibility mostly because I practiced</span> <span data-start="190.93" data-end="193.93">my accessibility talks on her and she's</span> <span data-start="193.93" data-end="195.129">asked me this and I'm all proud and I</span> <span data-start="195.129" data-end="196.93">say oh there's a lift and as we were</span> <span data-start="196.93" data-end="198.79">going up there we she says well where is</span> <span data-start="198.79" data-end="200.29">it we really couldn't see it from there</span> <span data-start="200.29" data-end="202.629">once we got to the top with we saw that</span> <span data-start="202.629" data-end="204.4">at the very at the other end of this</span> <span data-start="204.4" data-end="206.949">very long hallway you could see you</span> <span data-start="206.949" data-end="209.139">could tell there was lift and she told</span> <span data-start="209.139" data-end="211.15">me so in a wheelchair we have to go all</span> <span data-start="211.15" data-end="212.739">the way there and up and then all the</span> <span data-start="212.739" data-end="214.51">way back to do what we just did in a few</span> <span data-start="214.51" data-end="217.389">seconds that's not fair and children</span> <span data-start="217.389" data-end="219.4">have a way of seeing things for what</span> <span data-start="219.4" data-end="221.23">they are and even though this building</span> <span data-start="221.23" data-end="223.81">obviously it's very modern and comply</span> <span data-start="223.81" data-end="225.76">with all the standards it was it was</span> <span data-start="225.76" data-end="228.609">still a fact that it was not fair so I</span> <span data-start="228.609" data-end="229.81">like to expand on the previous</span> <span data-start="229.81" data-end="232.18">definition by saying that beyond no</span> <span data-start="232.18" data-end="234.609">denying access we need to make sure that</span> <span data-start="234.609" data-end="236.919">access that we are providing is fair to</span> <span data-start="236.919" data-end="238.75">all of our users and I'm giving full</span> <span data-start="238.75" data-end="242.199">credit to my daughter for that quote so</span> <span data-start="242.199" data-end="244.51">we've covered what accessibility is but</span> <span data-start="244.51" data-end="246.31">we mentioned the word disability so</span> <span data-start="246.31" data-end="248.53">let's look at that a little bit more we</span> <span data-start="248.53" data-end="250.9">are a disability can be split roughly</span> <span data-start="250.9" data-end="253.419">into these four categories physical</span> <span data-start="253.419" data-end="257.62">visual hearing and cognitive and while</span> <span data-start="257.62" data-end="259.989">we may be more familiar with permanent</span> <span data-start="259.989" data-end="262.9">disabilities we also have temporary and</span> <span data-start="262.9" data-end="264.419">situational</span> <span data-start="264.419" data-end="267.3">so those close captions that benefit a</span> <span data-start="267.3" data-end="270.09">deaf person can also benefit anyone of</span> <span data-start="270.09" data-end="272.91">us on that spectrum and I like to say us</span> <span data-start="272.91" data-end="275.28">because each and every one of us spend</span> <span data-start="275.28" data-end="277.919">some time in our daily lives on that</span> <span data-start="277.919" data-end="279.9">spectrum so you may have other reasons</span> <span data-start="279.9" data-end="282.15">for wanting to to watch that breaking</span> <span data-start="282.15" data-end="285.24">news video without audio and so it's not</span> <span data-start="285.24" data-end="287.4">an us versus them thing and we all</span> <span data-start="287.4" data-end="291">benefit from accessibility but going</span> <span data-start="291" data-end="293.43">back to permanent disability there's</span> <span data-start="293.43" data-end="294.87">about 1 billion people in the world the</span> <span data-start="294.87" data-end="296.52">disabilities it's about 15% of the</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="300.09">population but once you factor in where</span> <span data-start="300.09" data-end="302.55">in the world your user base is and what</span> <span data-start="302.55" data-end="304.65">their demographics are you'll get you'll</span> <span data-start="304.65" data-end="307.77">get a clearer picture a closer number to</span> <span data-start="307.77" data-end="309.99">what to what that percentage is for your</span> <span data-start="309.99" data-end="314.16">user base after we did those numbers it</span> <span data-start="314.16" data-end="316.8">worked out to be 26% around 26%</span> <span data-start="316.8" data-end="319.789">potentially of our of our user base and</span> <span data-start="319.789" data-end="323.55">at Ft and you know many other places we</span> <span data-start="323.55" data-end="325.889">go to great lengths to support all</span> <span data-start="325.889" data-end="328.41">segments of our audience so if we have</span> <span data-start="328.41" data-end="331.289">5% of people using IE 8 we kind of try</span> <span data-start="331.289" data-end="333.03">to make sure that they have some kind of</span> <span data-start="333.03" data-end="334.919">experience so in this case we had</span> <span data-start="334.919" data-end="336.95">potentially 26% of people who weren't</span> <span data-start="336.95" data-end="339">getting an experience at all so that</span> <span data-start="339" data-end="340.979">kind of just seeing things in numbers</span> <span data-start="340.979" data-end="343.95">tends to to motivate people to to get</span> <span data-start="343.95" data-end="345.69">started with things so let's say I've</span> <span data-start="345.69" data-end="347.849">convinced you now and you're determined</span> <span data-start="347.849" data-end="349.2">to do this are you gonna fix</span> <span data-start="349.2" data-end="350.789">accessibility on your style it's gonna</span> <span data-start="350.789" data-end="352.83">check you know what it's like and you're</span> <span data-start="352.83" data-end="355.47">gonna be their very best at it but it</span> <span data-start="355.47" data-end="357.36">scary and overwhelming and there's a lot</span> <span data-start="357.36" data-end="359.01">of information out there and it's kind</span> <span data-start="359.01" data-end="360.33">of hard to know where to start</span> <span data-start="360.33" data-end="364.44">our suggestion is just start small for</span> <span data-start="364.44" data-end="368.25">us starting small meant doing this we</span> <span data-start="368.25" data-end="369.15">installed poly</span> <span data-start="369.15" data-end="373.49">that's pa-11 why a 11y for accessibility</span> <span data-start="373.49" data-end="377.22">and tight palace and open source tool</span> <span data-start="377.22" data-end="380.039">that can check your HTML and</span> <span data-start="380.039" data-end="381.99">automatically detect some accessibility</span> <span data-start="381.99" data-end="383.97">errors and report them back to you it</span> <span data-start="383.97" data-end="385.289">doesn't detect everything but it's a</span> <span data-start="385.289" data-end="386.43">really good place to start if you have</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="389.25">nothing so the way it works is it goes</span> <span data-start="389.25" data-end="391.32">through your your markup and it change</span> <span data-start="391.32" data-end="393.599">it checks it against the web contact</span> <span data-start="393.599" data-end="396.12">content accessibility guidelines just or</span> <span data-start="396.12" data-end="397.15">wack</span> <span data-start="397.15" data-end="399.4">it's a list of criteria that accessible</span> <span data-start="399.4" data-end="401.83">websites should meet so it checks your</span> <span data-start="401.83" data-end="403.66">markup against that and it gives you a</span> <span data-start="403.66" data-end="405.76">report that looks something like that</span> <span data-start="405.76" data-end="409.479">that's when we ran pally manually</span> <span data-start="409.479" data-end="412.57">against the telecom it shows two errors</span> <span data-start="412.57" data-end="414.729">so although the first time we did it had</span> <span data-start="414.729" data-end="418.54">probably 100 errors and we once we did</span> <span data-start="418.54" data-end="419.74">this for the first time we could have</span> <span data-start="419.74" data-end="422.41">gone about manually fixing all of the</span> <span data-start="422.41" data-end="424.03">error site it found and then running it</span> <span data-start="424.03" data-end="427.33">again and so on but on such a large code</span> <span data-start="427.33" data-end="429.91">base like the one we have this wasn't</span> <span data-start="429.91" data-end="432.669">really efficient so we went for poly CI</span> <span data-start="432.669" data-end="435.16">which is basically a wrapper around poly</span> <span data-start="435.16" data-end="436.69">that you can integrate into your</span> <span data-start="436.69" data-end="439.449">continuous integration process so it</span> <span data-start="439.449" data-end="441.01">will run automatically every time I'll</span> <span data-start="441.01" data-end="442.9">show you in a little bit how that</span> <span data-start="442.9" data-end="445.66">happens there are other tools besides</span> <span data-start="445.66" data-end="448.87">poly that do this kind of thing but we</span> <span data-start="448.87" data-end="450.91">found poly just very easy to use very</span> <span data-start="450.91" data-end="453.34">easy to integrate and they are supported</span> <span data-start="453.34" data-end="454.51">by a fabulous team of hard-working</span> <span data-start="454.51" data-end="456.58">individuals that are just always there</span> <span data-start="456.58" data-end="459.37">with any you know any questions you may</span> <span data-start="459.37" data-end="460.9">have they're just very supportive and</span> <span data-start="460.9" data-end="463.3">just continuously working to improve the</span> <span data-start="463.3" data-end="465.37">tool so our so yeah we went with that</span> <span data-start="465.37" data-end="468.22">and it's been great so I want to show</span> <span data-start="468.22" data-end="470.44">you what that looks like in our project</span> <span data-start="470.44" data-end="473.28">this is a an overlay simplified view of</span> <span data-start="473.28" data-end="476.77">our of our stack we have several node</span> <span data-start="476.77" data-end="479.26">apps that make up ft.com so you'll see</span> <span data-start="479.26" data-end="481.45">the front page have article app signup</span> <span data-start="481.45" data-end="484.169">page my 50 page those whole node apps</span> <span data-start="484.169" data-end="487.96">they live in and github deploy them too</span> <span data-start="487.96" data-end="490.15">we will use circle CI for containers</span> <span data-start="490.15" data-end="493.06">integration and once we push that gets</span> <span data-start="493.06" data-end="494.65">triggered and if it's the master branch</span> <span data-start="494.65" data-end="495.9">it goes live to Heroku</span> <span data-start="495.9" data-end="498.34">again overly simplified but at least for</span> <span data-start="498.34" data-end="499.9">them for what we need it</span> <span data-start="499.9" data-end="503.349">it's enough of a view pally kicks in</span> <span data-start="503.349" data-end="506.139">thus the continuous integration step so</span> <span data-start="506.139" data-end="508.599">for every branch that we push this check</span> <span data-start="508.599" data-end="511.479">happens on the code for that branch and</span> <span data-start="511.479" data-end="514.63">then you get a report back to integrate</span> <span data-start="514.63" data-end="517.75">this with our with our existing build</span> <span data-start="517.75" data-end="519.789">process we only had to add one line and</span> <span data-start="519.789" data-end="523.69">all that line did was called policy I in</span> <span data-start="523.69" data-end="527.709">our case since we have we generator and</span> <span
