<p><span data-start="0.16" data-end="12.73"Audience member: Cool, hi, friends. I want to make a disclaimer before I start this talk. I think there are</span> <span data-start="12.73" data-end="15.57">a lot of really important talks that are happening at JSConf this year, including the one that's</span> <span data-start="15.57" data-end="18.65">happening over in the next room right now and those talks are on important topics that</span> <span data-start="18.65" data-end="24.34">can help us as technologists make the world a more accessible, equitable and honestly</span> <span data-start="24.34" data-end="29.8">affirming place for everybody and then there's this talk, my name is Kyle Hill and I live</span> <span data-start="29.8" data-end="35.12">in Washington, D.C. and these days I'm a code schoolteacher that works with new developers.</span> <span data-start="35.12" data-end="38.7">This is a story about terrible ideas. Specifically through The Lens of a terrible idea that I</span> <span data-start="38.7" data-end="42.53">had and executed this summer. In 2010, the DC government introduced a docked</span> <span data-start="42.53" data-end="49.59">bikeshare system called capital bikeshare. For a while it was the largest such system</span> <span data-start="49.59" data-end="58.18">in the entire world, at least until New York City installed theirs a few years later. At</span> <span data-start="58.18" data-end="64.89">this point there's 564 stations across the DC area with more still being added every</span> <span data-start="64.89" data-end="67.42">week. Seriously, they installed this station when I was writing in a bar about two weeks</span> <span data-start="67.42" data-end="74.43">ago right in front of me. So any of the solar powered station, you can use your credit card</span> <span data-start="74.43" data-end="79.4">or RFID key ID which looks like this, to rent a bike, take it anywhere for a half hour like</span> <span data-start="79.4" data-end="86.72">a library book, wait for the green light and happy acknowledgment sound to go off, and</span> <span data-start="86.72" data-end="94.13">walk away. The bikes themselves are  —  you know what? We're going to be positive and</span> <span data-start="94.13" data-end="102.86">uplifting here today. They're heavy. Each one weighs about 40 pounds, which means that</span> <span data-start="102.86" data-end="110.48">they're durable, the handlebars have a very, very sticky adhesive grip. Sometimes the front</span> <span data-start="110.48" data-end="115.89">brakes don't work, sometimes the back brakes don't work. These are not mutually exclusive</span> <span data-start="115.89" data-end="117.45">conditions. [laughter]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="117.45" data-end="125.53">And the turning radius is approximately the size of this stage that I'm standing on for</span> <span data-start="125.53" data-end="134.38">safety? So they're not actually fixies, though, they have three gears each. Which have their</span> <span data-start="134.38" data-end="150.73">uses. For the first gear, there's  —  and for the second gear you're actually climbing the</span> <span data-start="150.73" data-end="168.57">Tourmalet in the tour de France and the third gear is literally everything else. But it's</span> <span data-start="168.57" data-end="181.69">public infrastructure and nine years on from when the station why is first installed, a</span> <span data-start="181.69" data-end="193.65">lot of the original bikes are still in use with just like a modicum of upkeep and I really</span> <span data-start="193.65" data-end="205.68">do mean it when I call it an infrastructure, because in a weekday in nice weather you'll</span> <span data-start="205.68" data-end="212.79">have 20,000 trips in the course of a day. There are literally thousands of people in</span> <span data-start="212.79" data-end="223.84">the DC area that will use capital bikeshare to get to work in the morning and to get to</span> <span data-start="223.84" data-end="235.58">home in the evening except not really to home, just close to home? So I know this is a talk</span> <span data-start="235.58" data-end="243.53">about JavaScript and stuff, but I want to take a really indulgent minute to talk about</span> <span data-start="243.53" data-end="251.311">my actual favorite topic in the whole world Washington, D.C. So let's put 60 seconds on</span> <span data-start="251.311" data-end="260.76">the clock, and, ready? All right did the captioner get all yo, give it up?! : All right, deep</span> <span data-start="260.76" data-end="284.84">breath. Scroll on fun. One side effect to the L'Enfant Plan is that the big important</span> <span data-start="284.84" data-end="289.38">buildings like the Federal Government like departments and the law enforcement agencies,</span> <span data-start="289.38" data-end="295.33">they're all built in this downtown core, and if your company wants to work with politicians</span> <span data-start="295.33" data-end="298.96">and the Federal Government, you probably want to have your office right next to their office,</span> <span data-start="298.96" data-end="302.44">right? Well, DC has this really fun law called the height of buildings act. Congress passed</span> <span data-start="302.44" data-end="310.86">it in 1910 and while there are a lot of wild myths that go around about being no taller</span> <span data-start="310.86" data-end="316.03">than the Capitol dome or something. It actually restricts the residential buildings to be</span> <span data-start="316.03" data-end="322.02">no taller than the width of the street they're on functionally caps it at 15 or 20 stories</span> <span data-start="322.02" data-end="329.51">for our skyscrapers. Law dictates that if there's a limited amount</span> <span data-start="329.51" data-end="339.33">of proximate space to work downtown, eventually there won't be much space to live downtown</span> <span data-start="339.33" data-end="351.43">and that's kind of what happened. I call it the law of Massachusetts Avenue. Essentially</span> <span data-start="351.43" data-end="355.85">the neighborhoods north of this line are where people live and play and neighborhood south</span> <span data-start="355.85" data-end="360.03">of this line are where the tourists are, and where people's offices are, and the four,</span> <span data-start="360.03" data-end="365.02">you know, branches of the Federal Government, the White House, Congress, the Supreme Court,</span> <span data-start="365.02" data-end="369.051">and Aladdin the musical, the Kennedy Center. There's also the elevation problem. This is</span> <span data-start="369.051" data-end="376.11">the 15th street north cycle track. It was built back in 2010 to coincide with capital</span> <span data-start="376.11" data-end="384.35">bikeshare and it runs all the way to Columbia heights, which is called that for a reason.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.35" data-end="390.51">There is this one stretch my friend Eli's place used to be on that hill right next to</span> <span data-start="390.51" data-end="396.26">that white pickup truck. Trust me, walking up that hill sucks, it's a 9% grade went.</span> <span data-start="396.26" data-end="401.02">tour de France riders struggle with that. You know there's that one bikeshare station</span> <span data-start="401.02" data-end="410.4">right at the bottom of the hill, you kind of slide in there, but then the bikes don't</span> <span data-start="410.4" data-end="421.98">rebalance right, so these problems aren't unique to DC of course, and so the company</span> <span data-start="421.98" data-end="429.139">that runs our bikeshare system and a dozen others around the country employ these people</span> <span data-start="429.139" data-end="434.35">to drive around all day in rebalancing vans, moving bikes from place to place and sometimes</span> <span data-start="434.35" data-end="439.65">this isn't enough, so this past year they introduced a program called Bike Angels, which</span> <span data-start="439.65" data-end="446.74">is basically that, but for you, and now we can finally talk about my terrible idea.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="446.74" data-end="452.081">I have have to be honest here, I don't really have a great origin story for this. I remember</span> <span data-start="452.081" data-end="458.16">specifically going to a bar and talking to my friend, and telling her, hey, I have this</span> <span data-start="458.16" data-end="465.01">idea. I want to set the record for most Bike Angels points in a single day, and she looked</span> <span data-start="465.01" data-end="471.27">at me, drinking my fourth beer and smoking a clove and kind of tilted her head and visibly</span> <span data-start="471.27" data-end="477.07">ran through an entire list of questions in her head before finalling settling on how?</span> <span data-start="477.07" data-end="483.889">And I remember confidently responding with technology. Every 15 minutes the Bike Angels</span> <span data-start="483.889" data-end="490.289">code looks at the number of available bikes and docks at a station and compares it to</span> <span data-start="490.289" data-end="497.56">what it expects demand will be at the stations and assigns those 1, 2, or 3 points for taking</span> <span data-start="497.56" data-end="505.13">a bike out or putting a bike back in. If you take a bike from somewhere else to a work</span> <span data-start="505.13" data-end="513.05">station, you'll get points. If you take a bike from a black station to a white station,</span> <span data-start="513.05" data-end="517.759">you'll get both. The system kind of has some edge cases predicated</span> <span data-start="517.759" data-end="521.279">around you can't take a bike from a black station to another black station. The whole</span> <span data-start="521.279" data-end="527.41">goal is to actually encourage people to rebalance things but not just move them around. but</span> <span data-start="527.41" data-end="535.05">you've gamified the thing. What's the best way to get people to actually use it. Well,</span> <span data-start="535.05" data-end="539.889">here's a live updating monthly leaderboard with all the people who have opted into the</span> <span data-start="539.889" data-end="546.55">program that have points and at the bottom of that page is this curious little section</span> <span data-start="546.55" data-end="549.929">called record holders and the record was 124 points for a single day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.929" data-end="563.94">I could beat that! Right? ! >> OK, so the maximum number of points you</span> <span data-start="563.94" data-end="568.93">could get on any individual ride is 6. That's 3 out and 3 in. I would need to do 21 of those</span> <span data-start="568.93" data-end="575.399">in a day at least if I was going to break that record. If there's any way to predict</span> <span data-start="575.399" data-end="581.8">how the algorithm is going to pop up points I'm going to need to know where that is. Luckily</span> <span data-start="581.8" data-end="586.33">capital bikeshare publishes historical CSVs going all the way back to 2010 of every single</span> <span data-start="586.33" data-end="592.8">trip that's been taken when and where and they also have this end point that has a list</span> <span data-start="592.8" data-end="598.999">of all of the stations, the current number of points and bikes and empty docks, the GPS</span> <span data-start="598.999" data-end="605.029">coordinates. It's not exactly an API, but I've been using it for about five years to</span> <span data-start="605.029" data-end="608.089">teach new code school students how to do AJAX, so thanks for the benign neglect. I wrote</span> <span data-start="608.089" data-end="618.23">some code to scrape all this data every 30 minutes. And just let it run for a few weeks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="618.23" data-end="621.709">In the meantime I made sure to get around town as much as I could, partially to memorize</span> <span data-start="621.709" data-end="626.329">all the one-way bike lines, but partially to mess around with expectations. Say I took</span> <span data-start="626.329" data-end="635.569">a bike out of a station, would it take a while the algorithm to assign points to that station?</span> <span data-start="635.569" data-end="644.47">What  I found out pretty quickly is that while the</span> <span data-start="644.47" data-end="650.41">assignment of points to a station is partially a function of the number of bikes and docks</span> <span data-start="650.41" data-end="655.55">there, there's something more sophisticated, more machine learningy going on in the code</span> <span data-start="655.55" data-end="661.1">that makes doing it a practical impossibility. It sure seems like the algorithm takes into</span> <span data-start="661.1" data-end="666.749">account the following: Visits from the rebalancing van. The day of the week. The weather, the</span> <span data-start="666.749" data-end="670.79">historical demand at this time of day, the historical demand at this time of year, AKS,</span> <span data-start="670.79" data-end="681.809">is it the spring or the fall. So deduction is going to be impossible here, but what about</span> <span data-start="681.809" data-end="688.92">induction? If I can come up with a lot  —  I can make some logical assumptions and guesses</span> <span data-start="688.92" data-end="693.55">about how this algorithm works, I can try to do them and until they're like disproven,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="693.55" data-end="701.149">I can use them to try and maximize points for a minimal effort. At this point, it just</span> <span data-start="701.149" data-end="709.11">becomes video game and I'm playing it against the computer. In a way it's kind of like endurance</span> <span data-start="709.11" data-end="717.119">kinesthetic speed-running and my controller is on my keychain. So after I had that few</span> <span data-start="717.119" data-end="725.009">weeks' scraped data, I built this data visualization tool. By the way if you want to know a really</span> <span data-start="725.009" data-end="730.11">terrible idea that you shouldn't do, it's building your own map component in React.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="730.11" data-end="735.8">Like, cartography is a serious problem, well beyond my level of expertise. But you can</span> <span data-start="735.8" data-end="740.989">drag this and kind of see it update and the red stations are where points are available</span> <span data-start="740.989" data-end="745.069">and you know, the bigger and redder they are, the more  —  the blue ones are where points</span> <span data-start="745.069" data-end="751.189">are available for, you know, taking bikes out and you can see that the downtown area</span> <span data-start="751.189" data-end="758.48">is a good one for taking points out and more and more people are going to full station</span> <span data-start="758.48" data-end="764.629">that you can't put a bike in, where people live in Columbia heights is going to be full</span> <span data-start="764.629" data-end="770.11">because of that and we fast forward all the way to evening rush, you'll see that it sort</span> <span data-start="770.11" data-end="776.259">of flips the script a little bit. Downtown are more points because there are more people</span> <span data-start="776.259" data-end="780.809">who want to use capital bikeshare than there are bikes downtown and this big circle right</span> <span data-start="780.809" data-end="787.379">here is right next to Florida Avenue it was the station that we looked at earlier and</span> <span data-start="787.379" data-end="795.569">there are a lot of people who will park their bike there and not want to ride their bike</span> <span data-start="795.569" data-end="801.809">up the hill and who can blame them. 15 and 35 past the hour the points would change for</span> <span data-start="801.809" data-end="809.139">a station if it was no longer full or no longer empty, but at the top of the hour, everything</span> <span data-start="809.139" data-end="815.779">changed. My guess is that historical expectations of demand are bucketed into the hours of day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="815.779" data-end="821.47">And dramatically influence the calculations for the subsequent four segments. Some basic</span> <span data-start="821.47" data-end="831.1">math told me that if I focused on 12.4 points her hour, that's a reasonable segment, and</span> <span data-start="831.1" data-end="839.79">especially if I could leverage the higher point values during morning or evening rush.</span> <span data-start="839.79" data-end="847.449">I did some test is and it was going I was going to need to look for a nearby station</span> <span data-start="847.449" data-end="853.689">pairs with point asymmetries, but over the course of a few hours of lunch breaks I felt</span> <span data-start="853.689" data-end="858.499">confident I could actually find them and pull them off. So on Monday, July 15th, I decided</span> <span data-start="858.499" data-end="865.189">to go for it. So for record attempt No. 1, spoiler alert. I started after breakfast in</span> <span data-start="865.189" data-end="879.72">a pretty residential part of town. All I needed to do was find a bike and take it there, and</span> <span data-start="879.72" data-end="890.579">there was a reason why they were awarded points, the closest station was a kilometer walk away.</span> <span data-start="890.579" data-end="905.189">First ride was worth 5 points. From there, I realized that there was another station</span> <span data-start="905.189" data-end="920.179">that was nearby, and I could get a 3-point ride out of that. Drove it on the sidewalk</span> <span data-start="920.179" data-end="935.91">contra flow of the traffic for longer than I'm confident to admit. Started getting into</span> <span data-start="935.91" data-end="945.17">a groove of taking bikes from downtown to slightly further uptown. At 10:10 I found</span> <span data-start="945.17" data-end="955.42">a station pair. That was worth 4 points. But at 10:14 when the thing changed over, I realized</span> <span data-start="955.42" data-end="964.269">that there was now a 200-meter difference with station pair worth 4 points and in the</span> <span data-start="964.269" data-end="975.16">next segment I hit that five times. I ran between stations. There were definitely people</span> <span data-start="975.16" data-end="988.43">looking at their phones being like, who are you? Then I got an iced coffee, because it</span> <span data-start="988.43" data-end="1001.579">was a little bit hotter out than I thought it was going to be, but I sent a text to my</span> <span data-start="1001.579" data-end="1013.91">friends saying hey, I'm on an incredible pace, I'm going to be done in half an hour.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1013.91" data-end="1022.669">Then the expectations started to change and the points dried up dramatically. The metro</span> <span data-start="1022.669" data-end="1030.19">center station was worth a lot of points because it was full, but there weren't really many</span> <span data-start="1030.19" data-end="1039.05">places to put the bikes there, so I started shifting them literally wherever I could around</span> <span data-start="1039.05" data-end="1048.97">downtown and then the stationed started to be worth fewer points so I went on a little</span> <span data-start="1048.97" data-end="1056.29">bit of an experimental ride down towards the wharf. It's a new development in DC the tool</span> <span data-start="1056.29" data-end="1061.44">told me there would probably be some nice point asymmetries around 12:00, so rode all</span> <span data-start="1061.44" data-end="1069.84">the way across downtown and said a faint cuss word because I was now surrounded with no</span> <span data-start="1069.84" data-end="1079.62">points around a kilometer. So that kind of has a problem and I parked my bike in a now-full</span> <span data-start="1079.62" data-end="1086.34">station and was experiencing some consequences like dehydration and Kyle, you should have</span> <span data-start="1086.34" data-end="1094.64">put on sun block. I made my way to a station that was near a lunch place and parked it</span> <span data-start="1094.64" data-end="1100.05">and when I got halfway across the sidewalk I realized the consequences of what I'd done</span> <span data-start="1100.05" data-end="1111.39">which is that the station was probably now going to have points for the next 10 minutes.</span> <span data-start="1111.39" data-end="1122.34">So instead of getting Gatorade or sandwich, or making smart decisions I decided to just</span> <span data-start="1122.34" data-end="1137.09">keep going. So at 12:30 that station was worth 2 points for taking a bike out and again,</span> <span data-start="1137.09" data-end="1142.55">I just took them to wherever I could possibly go. A and instead of making smart decisions</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1142.55" data-end="1150.28">I got up north of 60 points and by the end of this hour, I actually took a bike from</span> <span data-start="1150.28" data-end="1158.66">one neighborhood to another. Crossing the 63-point halfway mark and then I really started</span> <span data-start="1158.66" data-end="1164.91">experiencing consequences. So Monday was supposed to have nice weather</span> <span data-start="1164.91" data-end="1173.65">and it ended up being 94 degrees Fahrenheit for anyone who's been in DC in the summer.</span> <span data-start="1173.65" data-end="1179.13">I might have been better trying to hang out in the shade but all those solar-powered bike</span> <span data-start="1179.13" data-end="1188.05">stations not gonna help out. I got it to the metro, took it to a station, looked at the</span> <span data-start="1188.05" data-end="1192.07">map, say there was a possible 2-point ride that would get me from nearby to the station</span> <span data-start="1192.07" data-end="1198.84">that was next to my house, and if you're going to be honest, I knew that I was probably done</span> <span data-start="1198.84" data-end="1206.9">at that particular moment. Parked the bike, looked at my phone. I had 8% battery left</span> <span data-start="1206.9" data-end="1215.97">and I was shattered physically in a very real way and I went home and I went to sleep.</span> <span data-start="1215.97" data-end="1219.3">And that was record attempt No. 1. [applause]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1219.3" data-end="1225.31">Why are you applauding? I failed. So I will admit that my preparation for record attempt</span> <span data-start="1225.31" data-end="1230.78">No. 1 was maybe a little suboptimal. There was definitely room for improvement.</span> <span data-start="1230.78" data-end="1237.79">But I couldn't try again for a while, as the entire East Coast immediately started experiencing</span> <span data-start="1237.79" data-end="1246.01">the worst heat wave of the summer. The next 8 days, the high temperature stayed north</span> <span data-start="1246.01" data-end="1258.55">of 95 in DC with the heat index in the 110s. To give you an idea right now outside in San</span> <span data-start="1258.55" data-end="1266.64">Diego, where the weather is pretty consistently gorgeous, the heat index is 72. So that's</span> <span data-start="1266.64" data-end="1278.77">in direct sunlight, where I was all day. No BS, even standing in a 110 heat index even</span> <span data-start="1278.77" data-end="1289.17">for five minutes is not just uncomfortable, but dangerous, but let's pretend that I prepared</span> <span data-start="1289.17" data-end="1295.09">correctly. Let's assume I made smarter routing decisions.</span> <span data-start="1295.09" data-end="1306.91">If the question I asked like, 125 slides ago was, can I do this? Can I score more than</span> <span data-start="1306.91" data-end="1320.13">120 points in a single day? I think the answer is yeah, I think I actually can. It's definitely</span> <span data-start="1320.13" data-end="1327.88">possible at least. You know, the algorithm has weak points and I successfully exploited</span> <span data-start="1327.88" data-end="1338.24">some of them to get as close as I can. So all my free time for the next week or so was</span> <span data-start="1338.24" data-end="1345.61">focused on building tools to make those assumptions true. First off, let's take a look at the</span> <span data-start="1345.61" data-end="1355.74">paths I can take. It's fine to look at the distance between stations as the crow flies,</span> <span data-start="1355.74" data-end="1364.76">but it turns out that a lot of people are not cool with me riding through their lobby.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1364.76" data-end="1368.51">Etc. The quantity of asphalt that I'm ever going</span> <span data-start="1368.51" data-end="1377.86">to actually see is going to shrink dramatically. From that I kind of realized that I could</span> <span data-start="1377.86" data-end="1387.03">turn all of the stations and the one-way bike lanes into a directed graph. And it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1387.03" data-end="1392.84">easy to calculate the measurements between those two points if you just use the great</span> <span data-start="1392.84" data-end="1400.04">circle formula, but the other part that sucks is a lot  —  just so much, is going uphill</span> <span data-start="1400.04" data-end="1405.64">and luckily there's the Open Elevation API, so I ran all those Node locations against</span> <span data-start="1405.64" data-end="1412.62">it and since this is a directed graph, I could figure out a rough approximation of the elevation</span> <span data-start="1412.62" data-end="1422.17">gain going each way and by mapping together the distance and hills on each vector, I was</span> <span data-start="1422.17" data-end="1428.22">able to reason out a single effort value between each pair of stations in each direction, and</span> <span data-start="1428.22" data-end="1429.93">that makes this just a traveling salesman problem.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1429.93" data-end="1434.49">Next up is routing. So after a few hours ever race-walking. I really started to back-slide.</span> <span data-start="1434.49" data-end="1445.47">I could look at the current map and find you some smart decisions to make within a few</span> <span data-start="1445.47" data-end="1456.55">seconds, because I've spent way too much time looking at that map. But if I'm outside, I'm</span> <span data-start="1456.55" data-end="1464.3">less capable, I have less tools and I'm also getting consistently tired, but what if I</span> <span data-start="1464.3" data-end="1471.06">could outsource my own decisionmaking here? So over the next couple of days I hacked together</span> <span data-start="1471.06" data-end="1479.01">a real quick and dirty, like why would anyone use tricatcher error conditions a React app</span> <span data-start="1479.01" data-end="1488.39">that let me input the station and it considered that defined distance elevation metric, all</span> <span data-start="1488.39" data-end="1503.04">this great data and the current state of affairs and figured out a nearby station pair predicated</span> <span data-start="1503.04" data-end="1511.66">on my logic that would make that the best station to make. But don't worry, all this</span> <span data-start="1511.66" data-end="1518.9">gets terrible because I had concerns about my cell phone battery and Chrome chewed through</span> <span data-start="1518.9" data-end="1526.26">that really fast. So why not look at some phantom JS logic. At the center bottom you've</span> <span data-start="1526.26" data-end="1532.39">got that last trip thing and it changes every time that I've finished a trip near instantaneously.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1532.39" data-end="1537.64">Why not just write some code to look for when that updates, assume that I'm at the end station</span> <span data-start="1537.64" data-end="1543.29">and that I want another ride and then just make one call to the decisionmaking API and</span> <span data-start="1543.29" data-end="1545.35">the second call to Twilio, and just send me a text message with stats and directions and</span> <span data-start="1545.35" data-end="1547.07">occasional random encouragement!</span> <span data-start="1547.07" data-end="1550.92">[laughter] And now I was ready to give this another shot.</span> <span data-start="1550.92" data-end="1554.43">Wednesday the 24th was going to be the day with possibly the nicest weather in DC all</span> <span data-start="1554.43" data-end="1558.08">summer. 83 degree, yes, I know, San Diego, yes, I know. Partly cloudy and low humidity.</span> <span data-start="1558.08" data-end="1563.04">Home stretch, y'all, let's do this. So the day started out with a 3-point ride within</span> <span data-start="1563.04" data-end="1567.3">my own neighborhood. Within 10 seconds of docking I had a text message from API me.</span> <span data-start="1567.3" data-end="1575.27">It said to go down the street, get mother bike, then do that route. I got another text</span> <span data-start="1575.27" data-end="1580.65">message. I'm fast forwarding through this all because there was absolutely no drama</span> <span data-start="1580.65" data-end="1588.01">in the mornings. Everything worked perfectly which is never what you'd expect from a hack</span> <span data-start="1588.01" data-end="1593.17">project. The higher system-wide demand made it less than optimal. I was riding at a sustainable</span> <span data-start="1593.17" data-end="1600.81">pace, I was hydrating, I was applying some luck, I was eating, I took a lunch break and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1600.81" data-end="1608.56">I ran to my friend Alexis, Alexis and I worked together a couple of jobs ago and she asked</span> <span data-start="1608.56" data-end="1615.08">me, what are you up to? I think that she meant what is your current employer, and what I</span> <span data-start="1615.08" data-end="1617.22">interpreted that as, was a little bit more in the moment. See, some ideas like this,</span> <span data-start="1617.22" data-end="1618.63">are inscrutable. If something made enough sense to be able to explain the how and why</span> <span data-start="1618.63" data-end="1623.84">to someone in the time it takes to assemble a sandwich, it's probably not that terrible</span> <span data-start="1623.84" data-end="1627.84">of an idea, and you're also not the only person to have had it. No, the most terrible ideas</span> <span data-start="1627.84" data-end="1629.41">are tragically personal. They are arts of the kind that only you'll ever know how to</span> <span data-start="1629.41" data-end="1631.84">make, and they happen to people, not for people. Until they get pursued, they just kind of</span> <span data-start="1631.84" data-end="1637.24">live as this ethereal unexplainable dream. Like, who wants to listen to some guy talk</span> <span data-start="1637.24" data-end="1640.11">about bikeshare points for half an hour? [laughter]</span> <span data-start="1640.11" data-end="1647.559">So after lunch I went to Union Station and since that's the one big blue dot that came</span> <span data-start="1647.559" data-end="1653.83">up and for the next two hours I moved bikes over and over and over again to the same station</span> <span data-start="1653.83" data-end="1660.72">that was right outside of the supermarket. The station was next to a window ledge where</span> <span data-start="1660.72" data-end="1666.14">the employees would take their breaks and walk me walk over every ten minutes like a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1666.14" data-end="1670.559">Russian doll time loop. I really wonder what they thought I was doing. So I emptied a couple</span> <span data-start="1670.559" data-end="1681.58">of stations with the help of a group of very, very confused tourists and that's when I sent</span> <span data-start="1681.58" data-end="1687.991">a text to my wife, hey, Kate, I'm on a great pace. I'm going to be done by happy hour!</span> <span data-start="1687.991" data-end="1690.8">At 2:45 the points updated. That station that I completely emptied, it was now worth points</span> <span data-start="1690.8" data-end="1694.5">for sure for taking bikes out of it. Bikes that did not presently exist. I'm not entirely</span> <span data-start="1694.5" data-end="1702.92">sure what I had done to the Bike Angels algorithm in that moment.</span> <span data-start="1702.92" data-end="1708.951">What untested and ununknown code you had just uncovered, but honestly I think I instantiated</span> <span data-start="1708.951" data-end="1709.951">a corner case so strange, alien and novel that I think it just instinctively started</span> <span data-start="1709.951" data-end="1710.951">defending itself. [laughter]</span> <span data-start="1710.951" data-end="1711.951">OK, capital hill stopped being more fruitful with points. The API wasn't going to be helpful</span> <span data-start="1711.951" data-end="1712.951">here so I realized that I could get across town but I needed to get there fast so I took</span> <span data-start="1712.951" data-end="1713.951">the metro across town and I ran up the escalator and I think that's when I turned my ankle.</span> <span data-start="1713.951" data-end="1714.951">I'm not sure but from this moment on, walking sucked. Which was not great, because the API</span> <span data-start="1714.951" data-end="1715.951">kept sending me to places over and over and over again, that were farther and farther</span> <span data-start="1715.951" data-end="1716.951">away as the points disappeared off the map. And I hit triple doubling it's, but now I'm</span> <span data-start="1716.951" data-end="1717.951">really kind of feeling it and it's hot and I'm tired and exhausted, and here was the</span> <span data-start="1717.951" data-end="1718.951">real problem. At 4:17 I took a bike out and took it about three blocks away and the API</span> <span data-start="1718.951" data-end="1719.951">crashed. See, it turns out quick and dirty hacks, should still throw tricatch in there</span> <span data-start="1719.951" data-end="1720.951">and there's a station blocks away, I did that four times, 5:00 hits, no more points around</span> <span data-start="1720.951" data-end="1721.951">for a kilometer in every direction and I just plopped down there right on the sidewalk and,</span> <span data-start="1721.951" data-end="1722.951">(sighs) sent some text messages and gave it some thought and called for a Lyft to go home.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1722.951" data-end="1723.951">You know that feeling when you're utterly exhausted and you desperately need no part</span> <span data-start="1723.951" data-end="1724.951">of your body to ever touch any other part of your body? That's me on my bed with my</span> <span data-start="1724.951" data-end="1725.951">internal monologue giving me a wonderful lecture, because I don't have any other entertainment</span> <span data-start="1725.951" data-end="1732.69">because I can't move my body and it went like this: "Kyle, what are you doing? What are</span> <span data-start="1732.69" data-end="1742.6">you trying to accomplish here? Do you think anyone's going to understand what you're doing?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1742.6" data-end="1748.07">Do YOU understand what you're doing? You quit everything you ever do. About 80% of the way</span> <span data-start="1748.07" data-end="1759.061">through. I mean, look at that map you just showed before. Why  —  why do you think this</span> <span data-start="1759.061" data-end="1763.93">will be any different? "And you smell awful," and point my senses and my internal monologue</span> <span data-start="1763.93" data-end="1772.77">agreed and so I walked very gingerly over into the shower and turned it on and just</span> <span data-start="1772.77" data-end="1774.96">stood there for five, ten minutes, mind blank, blistered, exhausted, sore, and I thought</span> <span data-start="1774.96" data-end="1778.67">about a text message I got from my wife right after I told her I was gonna quit.</span> <span data-start="1778.67" data-end="1784.66">And I  —  .. I started to feel a little better, at least my ankle did. And I thought, I can</span> <span data-start="1784.66" data-end="1807.38">make it to happy hour, I think. I don't want to walk there. I can't walk there. I sure</span> <span data-start="1807.38" data-end="1813.309">don't want to drive. I suck at that but I could bike over.</span> <span data-start="1813.309" data-end="1818.65">[laughter] So y'all seem smart, so you probably already</span> <span data-start="1818.65" data-end="1828.76">know how this ends. The fun part of terrible ideas is that while they cannot be explained</span> <span data-start="1828.76" data-end="1837.46">to any other person ever, if you pursue them to their logical conclusion, they leave a</span> <span data-start="1837.46" data-end="1845.25">beautiful corpse. I have code that I wrote for this. With really good ideas that it generated.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1845.25" data-end="1854.23">I have a rekindled love for JavaScript in the city that I live in. I have a very interesting</span> <span data-start="1854.23" data-end="1861.08">life lesson that I honestly came by that taught me things about persistence and determination.</span> <span data-start="1861.08" data-end="1870.83">I have a story to tell about the time I set a world record for bikeshare points, by why</span> <span data-start="1870.83" data-end="1877.41">biking 41 miles and walking a half-marathon and that story includes the time I took the</span> <span data-start="1877.41" data-end="1884.88">very last bike out from that station right below Mery Hill park and that very day the</span> <span data-start="1884.88" data-end="1895.61">skies opened and I rode through the most celebratory thunderstorm I will ever experience. Not an</span> <span data-start="1895.61" data-end="1899.12">obstacle thrown in my way through an algorithm, but a real, alive, visceral experience. I'm</span> <span data-start="1899.12" data-end="1904.49">never going to forget it and I remember walking into the very crowded bar afterwards, soaked</span> <span data-start="1904.49" data-end="1913.85">to the skin, and Kate handed me that promised margarita, and she introduced me to her brand</span> <span data-start="1913.85" data-end="1914.85">new colleague and he asked me: "So what did you do today?"</span> <span data-start="1914.85" data-end="1916.48">[laughter] That's all I got.</span> </p>
