<p><span data-start="6.97" data-end="13.17">Okay, good, so welcome to this talk and it's about advance user experience with tensorflow J's and</span> <span data-start="13.69" data-end="14.92">I'm Oliver</span> <span data-start="14.92" data-end="20.309">And this talk really is it is about user experience, but it's much more about</span> <span data-start="21.07" data-end="26.549">Finding good applications for machine learning in the browser and I want to kick this off because I have zero slides</span> <span data-start="26.55" data-end="30.119">So I want to kick this off with a stone joke</span> <span data-start="30.699" data-end="37.468">Hopefully no one knows it already. So this is about user experience. And oh sorry, this is about user experience in the way</span> <span data-start="38.379" data-end="43.499">It actually works. So hope for the internet works here. So this is what you the user do</span> <span data-start="44.8" data-end="46.8">So it doesn't work quite</span> <span data-start="47.2" data-end="49.2">Obviously guys wrong</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="49.75" data-end="52.11">Fixing it. This is I mean</span> <span data-start="53.14" data-end="58.02">Because you're laughing. I know you have the same feeling as me. Yeah, if you have watch people using user</span> <span data-start="60.46" data-end="62.46">So same thing fixing it</span> <span data-start="63.28" data-end="64.9">Again, yes</span> <span data-start="64.9" data-end="68.729">So that's the joke that I stole but obviously it worked</span> <span data-start="69" data-end="75.029">Because I think it only works if you have some sort of experience like this you think so hard about you user</span> <span data-start="75.549" data-end="77.699">Interface and then that's what people end up doing</span> <span data-start="77.77" data-end="82.56">They will figure out how to how to deal with it, but maybe not them sense you expected it</span> <span data-start="82.56" data-end="85.35">So this talk is about the same thing</span> <span data-start="86.14" data-end="88.349">Don't blame me for the for the styling</span> <span data-start="89.14" data-end="91.229">This is my weak spot. Oh wait</span> <span data-start="91.84" data-end="93.25">so, um</span> <span data-start="93.25" data-end="99.72">In a typical user interface. So this regard those buttons those are real buttons the the buttons down here. I'm not real buttons</span> <span data-start="99.72" data-end="101.72">so the buttons are just here to</span> <span data-start="101.979" data-end="104.039">make a point so typically</span> <span data-start="105.369" data-end="107.369">In a very classic</span> <span data-start="108.25" data-end="115.019">user interface the buttons they will light up when you hover over them to give people the the</span> <span data-start="115.899" data-end="118.949">certainty when you click now, you will click this button, so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="119.56" data-end="125.339">What I had in mind was would it be at all possible to highlight the buttons before you click them?</span> <span data-start="125.34" data-end="131.61">So would it be possible that the machine learns? Which button are you going to click now on next and</span> <span data-start="133.14" data-end="138.63">You may ask what could be the applications of this and I've talked to quite some user experience people that said</span> <span data-start="139.39" data-end="146.039">Nothing or less and then they thought for a little bit longer. So maybe I asked you so I get something back here</span> <span data-start="146.13" data-end="149.789">Why would even do that? I mean highlight the button before the user clicks on it</span> <span data-start="150.37" data-end="154.44">Predicting which button is it going to be any ideas any takers? Yes</span> <span data-start="156.52" data-end="162.029">Perfect so about flows so actually I haven't implemented this but with the buttons up there</span> <span data-start="162.06" data-end="166.739">that's a horrible user interface because you need to click those buttons in certain order and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="166.989" data-end="170.549">Some orders are totally don't make any sense you get weird error messages</span> <span data-start="170.95" data-end="176.97">This would be my next step like learn how to actually use those buttons up there because they're they're complex</span> <span data-start="177.519" data-end="180.809">But I haven't implemented this yet. So what?</span> <span data-start="181.45" data-end="184.259">What would be another reason why would you why would you do that? Yes</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="186.97" data-end="194.639">Accessibility yes, so make it easier. So that was also my fault. Yes. You have another point. Yes in the back</span> <span data-start="196.33" data-end="198.33">Sorry</span> <span data-start="198.88" data-end="202.35">Yes preload resources that was also something that I came up with</span> <span data-start="202.35" data-end="207.929">someone said maybe there so I don't know a server less function behind that button and you want to start it up because you think</span> <span data-start="207.93" data-end="212.25">Oh, the user is going to click on that button soon. You better have this thing ready or</span> <span data-start="212.92" data-end="214.92">Preload the next page or someone</span> <span data-start="215.38" data-end="217.439">I've written down some stuff. Wait. Oh</span> <span data-start="218.65" data-end="224.88">yeah, someone came up with the idea when there's artificial reality and it's always</span> <span data-start="225.43" data-end="231.66">Pretty hard to decide which detail are you going to show and then if you can predict where the user is going to look next?</span> <span data-start="231.79" data-end="233.79">then you can preload that stuff and</span> <span data-start="235.69" data-end="240.57">Again I only implemented the easiest word because I just wanted to know it's this at all possible</span> <span data-start="240.57" data-end="244.259">Could you even do that? And the easiest version that I implemented is just what you said</span> <span data-start="244.26" data-end="248.88">I highlighted the button that I think the users going to click. So, um</span> <span data-start="250.48" data-end="254.31">There could be heuristics to do this you could just measure I don't know</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="254.59" data-end="257.19">It's the user close to a button like this</span> <span data-start="257.19" data-end="261.839">and if the if it's reasonably close then you would highlight that button which I don't do now and</span> <span data-start="262.539" data-end="266.549">You could also check its the mouse closer to this button</span> <span data-start="266.55" data-end="271.17">And so they and it might all work, but it might not match the individual style</span> <span data-start="271.42" data-end="273.869">That someone has that used this user interface</span> <span data-start="273.87" data-end="274.84">for example</span> <span data-start="274.84" data-end="277.41">my I always use the trackpad and it's</span> <span data-start="277.63" data-end="282.899">extremely sensitive because I don't move much and that might mean if I want to hit this button I might</span> <span data-start="283.57" data-end="285.57">Briefly go over it and then go back</span> <span data-start="286.03" data-end="292.619">That means depending on the user that you're having and depending on the machine that you're using and how is it set up?</span> <span data-start="293.169" data-end="296.939">The mouse movements might be completely different. So I'm pretty sure</span> <span data-start="297.52" data-end="304.5">In my I'm not sure that I'm pretty sure a machine might identify me just by my mouse movements</span> <span data-start="304.81" data-end="309.419">Out of all of the people in the on somebody's nodding. I haven't made the experience but my mouse</span> <span data-start="309.94" data-end="313.169">Mouse movements are so weird. Italy makes people really nervous</span> <span data-start="314.02" data-end="315.55">angry</span> <span data-start="315.55" data-end="316.72">so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="316.72" data-end="322.979">Having said that so what I came up with is that I said, maybe it's possible to learn that</span> <span data-start="324.52" data-end="327.15">Those movements using machine gun and</span> <span data-start="328.21" data-end="332.04">If you want to do that, the the crucial part is you need data</span> <span data-start="332.44" data-end="336.45">So the typical machine learning that we do you need to have data and if you don't have data</span> <span data-start="337.75" data-end="343.769">Probably not going to work, but fortunately I can generate data on the fly and I'm doing it like this</span> <span data-start="343.77" data-end="351.06">So once I hover over button, I generate a data set and typically the user would also need to click that button</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.1" data-end="356.549">But it would take me forever to generate just a few data samples if I really clicked on that button</span> <span data-start="356.55" data-end="361.079">So for the sake of this demo, I'm just counting hovering over button is a click</span> <span data-start="361.24" data-end="367.079">this is this is just fake or hacked but that's the only hack part and I'm doing this to</span> <span data-start="368.11" data-end="369.55">quickly</span> <span data-start="369.55" data-end="372.9">Get some data. Yeah, and what kind of data would you I mean, I'm</span> <span data-start="373.81" data-end="377.07">Generating data. What kind of data would you would you collect what would you do?</span> <span data-start="377.07" data-end="382.469">I mean if you were to predict the button I'm going to click you solve those movements. What would you recall?</span> <span data-start="383.11" data-end="384.97">Yes</span> <span data-start="384.97" data-end="388.019">Proximity you could record that I did not do this. What else?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="389.86" data-end="391.86">Yes</span> <span data-start="393.13" data-end="399.479">Yes, that's what I did so I recorded XY of the mouse I recorded the Delta between the previous</span> <span data-start="400.36" data-end="405.37">Movement because I just get this from the mouse movie event. I just get this for free and</span> <span data-start="406.189" data-end="409.629">delta-t exactly what you say so and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="410.99" data-end="415.299">There's also something really special about this. I recalled a sequence of</span> <span data-start="416.36" data-end="419.199">So to say time stamps and I can show these</span> <span data-start="421.58" data-end="428.68">If I find them on local storage, there you go, so I stole them local storage and</span> <span data-start="430.729" data-end="433.329">They are they give me a second here</span> <span data-start="436.159" data-end="442.629">And that's how they look like so this why hopefully it's big enough is it big enough for the back</span> <span data-start="443.15" data-end="447.759">Yeah good. So the why it's just an idea of the button and two means this one I</span> <span data-start="448.279" data-end="450.279">Think so. This one should be</span> <span data-start="451.46" data-end="459.159">One and this might be zero or maybe this is one. This is two this is three, but I'm not quite sure but why represents?</span> <span data-start="461.06" data-end="463.06">The button and I</span> <span data-start="464" data-end="470.199">Made this already complicated so x and y don't mean positions on the screen, but they mean the input sequence</span> <span data-start="470.69" data-end="473.919">This is x and y is the button that I'm going to click so</span> <span data-start="474.469" data-end="476.469">this is the input sequence of</span> <span data-start="476.839" data-end="480.729">Mouth positions you see this is position X this is position Y</span> <span data-start="481.279" data-end="487.269">Delta X Delta Y that means difference from the previous mouse position and this is the time step or delta T</span> <span data-start="487.61" data-end="492.49">So how much time how many milliseconds past from this event to the other?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.069" data-end="496.119">And sometimes it's very similar and sometimes it's different</span> <span data-start="496.939" data-end="498.939">so that's my input and</span> <span data-start="499.43" data-end="500.509">I</span> <span data-start="500.509" data-end="503.259">Did some pre-processing on that because I was considering</span> <span data-start="503.81" data-end="510.429">how many of them would I really need like maybe 10 maybe 100 because I didn't know I</span> <span data-start="510.86" data-end="514.659">Cut all these sequences into parts and trained all of this into the model</span> <span data-start="515.029" data-end="518.289">So but you could like for example</span> <span data-start="518.289" data-end="524.198">What would he suggest that you could have taken anything else and if it works you find out by experiment?</span> <span data-start="524.199" data-end="530.949">That's how it works in machinery. So you make an assumption you try the model and then you see if it works and</span> <span data-start="531.68" data-end="536.48">well, this might work at see so I have the data now and now I</span> <span data-start="537.36" data-end="539.36">have this</span> <span data-start="539.61" data-end="544.28">This collection of buttons and I'm the only person in the world right now who knows how to</span> <span data-start="544.53" data-end="550.549">Use this thing because it's a horrible user interface giving a talk but user interfaces and then they playing horribly. I</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="551.25" data-end="554.6">Apologize, but that's the way it is. Now I can train on that data</span> <span data-start="554.6" data-end="559.429">So I collected some data and I collected some data before you see I have</span> <span data-start="560.4" data-end="567.889">369 dataset that means um, I don't know my wave down here from over from outside to down here. I</span> <span data-start="568.44" data-end="573.17">Did some clicks to have some sample data and if you're at all into machine learning having?</span> <span data-start="573.78" data-end="576.23">370 samples for three categories is nothing</span> <span data-start="576.75" data-end="580.7">Tippity people won't even start they will say this is not going to work. Well</span> <span data-start="581.7" data-end="586.1">But maybe does so I'm clicking this train model now, this is all</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="586.8" data-end="592.01">I've no fall back. That's why I'm having sweaty palms here. So this looks good</span> <span data-start="593.13" data-end="594.69">reasonably good</span> <span data-start="594.69" data-end="596.749">this is using tensorflow, Jess and</span> <span data-start="597.87" data-end="602">Tensorflow jess comes with a very nice brutalization library. I did not write this code</span> <span data-start="602.13" data-end="607.729">So this stuff that comes with tensorflow Jess and it shows you something and hopefully something good</span> <span data-start="607.88" data-end="611.929">Oh and shows me something good, but I didn't know before I kicked off this thing. So it looks good</span> <span data-start="612.54" data-end="614.599">What's most interesting is these?</span> <span data-start="616.95" data-end="619.22">Two curves down here. That's why I'm doing it now</span> <span data-start="619.74" data-end="620.85">and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.85" data-end="625.519">These curves tell you something about how well the training process</span> <span data-start="626.25" data-end="627.92">Proceeds I will show you some code later</span> <span data-start="627.92" data-end="630.769">But let's save on the conceptual level for a while</span> <span data-start="631.26" data-end="636.439">And we concentrate on that blue curve and the blue curve describes over time</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="637.41" data-end="643.339">How well is the machine learning a model able to reproduce the data that that I gave to it?</span> <span data-start="643.34" data-end="647.09">so I've had in the mouse movement sequences and</span> <span data-start="647.58" data-end="653.179">as a prediction the button that is going to be clicked and now the machine learning tries to</span> <span data-start="654.3" data-end="656.3">learn which sequence</span> <span data-start="658.2" data-end="660.2">Spits out which bar and</span> <span data-start="660.27" data-end="667.639">the higher the blue line gets the better it is able to do that and this is around 70 percent or</span> <span data-start="668.1" data-end="670.219">0.67 that means of the 70</span> <span data-start="670.95" data-end="676.189">Sorry off of all the mouse movements that I did 70 percent of them. The model is able to predict correctly</span> <span data-start="676.44" data-end="679.609">so I made some movements to the to the button and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="681" data-end="683.329">That's pretty good 70 percent on that</span> <span data-start="684.389" data-end="685.8">pretty astonishing</span> <span data-start="685.8" data-end="693.109">But what's much more astonishing is the orange line because that is data points that the model has never seen that means</span> <span data-start="693.87" data-end="697.88">20% which I decided deliberately I've taken off from the</span> <span data-start="699.089" data-end="704.779">Start now it looks good. I've taken off from from the training data, and I'm just using it</span> <span data-start="706.32" data-end="708.32">To</span> <span data-start="708.48" data-end="716.06">Constantly check how well the model is doing on something it has never seen and is anyone at all familiar with machine learning anyone?</span> <span data-start="717.57" data-end="721.279">When we say it doesn't look I mean would it would you have expected that</span> <span data-start="722.55" data-end="724.55">Who would have expected that?</span> <span data-start="726.149" data-end="731.299">Maybe you didn't expect that because I did make myself quite clear, but this is a pretty outstanding</span> <span data-start="731.82" data-end="739.64">Result so it's not something you could expect from very small training data training on this machine is a very powerful</span> <span data-start="739.8" data-end="741.8">GPU but it's still a laptop</span> <span data-start="742.62" data-end="746.929">Something like this. Typically. I don't know. It wouldn't perform that well. I'm not quite sure</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="746.93" data-end="752.449">Why does this is so welcome to the world of machinery, you make an experiment. You can't explain it just works and</span> <span data-start="753.839" data-end="758.779">that's my world at least javascript is also my world but also that so um</span> <span data-start="760.17" data-end="767.719">before we try that and I'm hope you saw I just tried trade this online we can get some more information and</span> <span data-start="768.54" data-end="771.62">This is also built into the visualization tools of tensorflow</span> <span data-start="771.72" data-end="778.73">and I'm always so happy if you guys don't see any red stuff in the console because it's it seems to work quite well and</span> <span data-start="779.1" data-end="784.969">This is a while. I'm hiding this for a second because what you see now, it's a very powerful tool</span> <span data-start="785.22" data-end="790.61">It's called the confusion matrix. I don't think it's only used in machine learning but in</span> <span data-start="791.19" data-end="794.089">Machine learning it actually is so what can you see on?</span> <span data-start="795.48" data-end="798.62">The y-axis that is this axis here</span> <span data-start="799.97" data-end="807.16">you see the real buttons that the model should predict because it knows those are the real buttons that means</span> <span data-start="807.86" data-end="810.55">left button middle button right button and on</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="811.04" data-end="815.319">The x-axis you see the prediction of the model and this is useful</span> <span data-start="815.509" data-end="823.509">Because in the perfect world and in the model that works perfectly you would expect all the clicks to be on that diagonal here</span> <span data-start="824.72" data-end="830.47">But you don't see that you see something else. So what do you see? So this means the real</span> <span data-start="831.589" data-end="833.919">value that the model should predict is left and</span> <span data-start="834.769" data-end="838.629">The prediction actually also is left that's good. But then this here</span> <span data-start="839.389" data-end="841.629">The predictor should be left, but it was middle</span> <span data-start="843.35" data-end="848.62">22 quite a few and then the prediction should be left but it is right and</span> <span data-start="849.05" data-end="851.769">Then for all the three buttons so for the middle button</span> <span data-start="852.44" data-end="858.88">we see something that at least from my perspective was expected because the middle button is so close to the other buttons that</span> <span data-start="859.279" data-end="861.279">You get a lot of confusion</span> <span data-start="861.8" data-end="866.319">Even though it is the middle button you get a lot of confusion for either left or the right button</span> <span data-start="866.509" data-end="868.509">so that's also totally expected and</span> <span data-start="870.139" data-end="876.849">Finally for the right button that's also something that's slowly expected and also something that I would have expected for the left button</span> <span data-start="877.069" data-end="883.179">So it's actually the right button, but sometimes you confuse it with the middle button, but only rarely with the left</span> <span data-start="883.759" data-end="887.619">And this is because of the way I created those silly mouse movements</span> <span data-start="887.62" data-end="892.299">But it's actually pretty good even without trying the model. I now know that this model might be good. Um,</span> </p>

We have one more metric and this is accuracy per button</span> <span data-start="989.339" data-end="994.339">That means this is this is just a number and this number there's an API for it</span> <span data-start="994.339" data-end="1000.489">I'll just question that number and then I could write some code if the accuracy is above say 70% for all the buttons</span> </p>

I'm really so this is no show that I'm scared</span> <span data-start="1012.5" data-end="1015.819">so I can toggle the prediction and</span> <span data-start="1016.85" data-end="1019.36">I need to open the console because all the interesting stuff</span> <span data-start="1020.149" data-end="1025.389">Is still locked here. This is very early example, so now</span> <span data-start="1026.51" data-end="1028.51">Let's see. So what you see</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1028.909" data-end="1035.319">I'm doing this thing where I'm pretty sure that that it will be. Okay. So just see oh it looks okay</span> <span data-start="1035.319" data-end="1040.779">So now it will predict I'm going to click the right button and there's no explanation for that</span> <span data-start="1041.419" data-end="1047.439">Yes, there might be an intuition. It changes a little bit still right button, but</span> <span data-start="1048.38" data-end="1053.949">This thing basically is a black box. So you have no idea. Why does it you just happy that it does</span> <span data-start="1054.47" data-end="1058.6">but you get some information you get some information down in the console and this is</span> <span data-start="1059.539" data-end="1061.52">probability per button</span> <span data-start="1061.52" data-end="1063.52">so these</span> <span data-start="1069.21" data-end="1071.21">So the microphone is here</span> <span data-start="1071.55" data-end="1075.859">I could have used the mouse, but then I would change this so</span> <span data-start="1076.86" data-end="1078.86">let's stick to this one, right so</span> <span data-start="1079.41" data-end="1081.92">That means the probability for the right button</span> <span data-start="1082.44" data-end="1083.49">75%</span> <span data-start="1083.49" data-end="1088.55">the probability for the middle button is 10 and the probability for the left button is 15% that</span> </p>

I'm them just close to it</span> <span data-start="1104.67" data-end="1108.32">Left button in works, and I had sweaty hands it sort of works</span> <span data-start="1108.36" data-end="1115.19">You wouldn't probably say it's perfect. And it also seems to work on proximity. Not not of mouse path, right?</span> <span data-start="1115.95" data-end="1118.489">Maybe limit on Mouse path, but mostly on proximity</span> <span data-start="1119.4" data-end="1121.4">At least that's my impression. Would you agree?</span> <span data-start="1121.71" data-end="1123.71">Is it Mouse path?</span> <span data-start="1123.81" data-end="1127.009">It's not perfect. You see that it's not perfect, but it might be good enough</span> <span data-start="1128.49" data-end="1134.21">For anything reasonable and we just did this on the fly right here. So it's it's not something that I prepared</span> <span data-start="1134.88" data-end="1140.42">Um, but you might ask it's this maybe you asked that I don't know if you do. I'm just saying you ask</span> <span data-start="1140.46" data-end="1142.789">Is this the right way to do or would you rather?</span> <span data-start="1144.42" data-end="1150.08">Not use proximity so much but do you really the movement of the mouse is that more interesting and</span> <span data-start="1150.72" data-end="1157.939">if you value proximity or the the past of the mouse movement over a proximity and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1158.22" data-end="1161.659">That is something that you model into your model and I will show the model now</span> <span data-start="1163.44" data-end="1165.44">Hopefully</span> <span data-start="1167.52" data-end="1171.229">Sorry just enough space</span> <span data-start="1176.94" data-end="1181.789">So, um, then it's the tensor flow test part and all the other part</span> <span data-start="1181.79" data-end="1184.07">I'm pretty sure all of you could also write this is just</span> <span data-start="1184.44" data-end="1189.529">clicking and then have a mouse missed 9 then have a quick list not all that stuff and prepare the data has had a little</span> <span data-start="1189.53" data-end="1193.28">Bit but this is the part where you only have very few lines of code</span> <span data-start="1193.32" data-end="1197.96">But you need to think about those few guys of course and have variations of this so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1198.99" data-end="1202.459">This tensorflow thing is it's the tensorflow namespace</span> <span data-start="1203.07" data-end="1208.49">I'm saying I want to a sequential model. That means we have layers they follow each other and</span> <span data-start="1209.07" data-end="1213.62">The first and this now it gets interesting. So this stuff before maybe not so much</span> <span data-start="1213.66" data-end="1220.729">This says it's a simple RNN and that is the sort of neural network that can learn from a sequence of things</span> <span data-start="1221.52" data-end="1224.239">And there's a lot of stuff that you don't need to know about</span> <span data-start="1225.12" data-end="1227.12">but this will say I</span> <span data-start="1227.4" data-end="1228.42">have</span> <span data-start="1228.42" data-end="1231.559">quite sure how many maybe it's 25 I cut the the</span> <span data-start="1232.08" data-end="1238.46">mouse movements into into chunks and then have five features that means how does the input to this thing look like and</span> <span data-start="1238.8" data-end="1244.159">Then this says how many neurons do I want? And this is tony hand-wavy you just try that out</span> <span data-start="1244.16" data-end="1248.54">and typically you don't want to use too many because it needs to be trainable on the browser and</span> <span data-start="1249.6" data-end="1256.25">You saw it is if you take less it goes much faster, if you take more it might not work. So well and and</span> <span data-start="1257.28" data-end="1261.949">It also takes a lot of time and you saw the predictions were actually real time online</span> <span data-start="1263.19" data-end="1265.19">so the interesting part is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1265.92" data-end="1268.519">The evaluation of this thing was is much worse</span> <span data-start="1269.22" data-end="1271.76">Than on the other things that I will show in a minute</span> <span data-start="1272.76" data-end="1280.579">But in real life it showed it showed the behavior that people actually expected that when I moved close to a button</span> <span data-start="1281.25" data-end="1283.25">It should be highlighted</span> <span data-start="1283.44" data-end="1290.84">That's the that's a result people expected. But actually maybe you rather want something where the whole path the whole movement</span> <span data-start="1291.51" data-end="1295.699">Falls much mentor into into account and there are other</span> <span data-start="1296.25" data-end="1301.88">styles of neural networks that are better at this so you decide how much of the history do you want to keep and how much</span> <span data-start="1301.88" data-end="1305.9">interesting how interesting is their history and I have</span> <span data-start="1307.89" data-end="1309.89">Wait I have this</span> <span data-start="1310.59" data-end="1316.88">Pre-recorded because I didn't know if I would be able to make this run in return. So this thing here</span> <span data-start="1318.66" data-end="1322.969">In the middle you see it reacts much faster or much</span> <span data-start="1323.82" data-end="1326.45">Very much earlier. It was it was an earlier version of this thing</span> <span data-start="1326.76" data-end="1333.41">But it only reacts not by proximity but of the path that you did that mouse describes</span> <span data-start="1334.29" data-end="1335.49">so it's</span> <span data-start="1335.49" data-end="1339.35">Much more expensive it took much more resources to train and it's still not</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1339.42" data-end="1342.019">Intuitive because if you if you just move close to the button</span> <span data-start="1342.15" data-end="1345.44">It will do won't do anything because that's not how you click on a button</span> <span data-start="1345.44" data-end="1348.98">You don't slow you go to the button and then you eventually click. This is much more</span> <span data-start="1349.14" data-end="1351.98">Much closer to what you actually do and if you want to do that</span> <span data-start="1352.77" data-end="1356.36">you will use a different type of machine learning model and</span> <span data-start="1357.27" data-end="1359.3">this different type of machine learning model is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1360.09" data-end="1362.09">Commended out here</span> <span data-start="1362.1" data-end="1366.889">it's called an LS TM which means long short-term memory network and</span> <span data-start="1368.07" data-end="1371.059">You might see that apart from this thing here</span> <span data-start="1371.82" data-end="1377.269">Where's this? It's same thing and the name is different. But the name is just name of variable. Then there's a</span> <span data-start="1377.82" data-end="1380.989">cheaper version of this which is called GRU, but</span> <span data-start="1381.75" data-end="1386.36">You could just exchange that and do different experiments see and I made some comments</span> <span data-start="1387.36" data-end="1388.83">slow to train</span> <span data-start="1388.83" data-end="1395.419">Evaluation is bad, but it actually performed really well and in its it's the network that I used for the for the second example</span> <span data-start="1397.26" data-end="1401.54">Good five minutes left so I will show some more code unless</span> <span data-start="1402.9" data-end="1405.259">They're questions right now questions</span> <span data-start="1407.16" data-end="1409.16">Yes</span> <span data-start="1411.6" data-end="1413.629">Yes, so the question is</span> <span data-start="1414.3" data-end="1416.419">Have I made something like a baseline? Where you?</span> <span data-start="1417" data-end="1421.52">Exit and no but exactly what you propose also was in my head</span> <span data-start="1421.52" data-end="1425.389">I'm just using the vector and I'm seeing what is the the mouse curve pointing?</span> <span data-start="1425.39" data-end="1429.259">It might be it works better, but I haven't done this and also not proximity</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1429.26" data-end="1434.39">I think it would be it would be pretty easy to implement, but I didn't want to spoil it for myself. I think</span> <span data-start="1434.94" data-end="1439.519">Maybe it works better. If you do that, please contribute. It's on github make a pull request</span> <span data-start="1439.52" data-end="1443.119">I would be maybe I would not be so happy, but please still do</span> <span data-start="1444.39" data-end="1449.3">It could be better. So but the point being here, maybe that's maybe the use case is silly</span> <span data-start="1449.3" data-end="1455.45">I'm not even sure myself, but the point here is so this data it never left the browser</span> <span data-start="1455.76" data-end="1459.89">So this stays in the browser, you can download it yourself</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1459.89" data-end="1463.999">But it will never reach the server of someone you don't trust in terms of privacy</span> <span data-start="1464" data-end="1470.21">For example, you don't want that maybe and also the model that you're training is also completely it stays on your machine</span> <span data-start="1470.64" data-end="1475.46">It will not leave your machine and the prediction will also be on your machine and it will be in real time</span> <span data-start="1475.46" data-end="1482.6">That means you do something and and the model will predict you didn't see any at least I didn't see any delay</span> <span data-start="1483.51" data-end="1489.83">And you didn't see any installation so you can start this maybe not on your phone because you don't have the mouse</span> <span data-start="1489.83" data-end="1494.119">But you couldn't start this on any laptop and it would still work if you know, which part is a click</span> <span data-start="1494.7" data-end="1499.85">And that's the point. So if you if you have anything you think that might be a good idea</span> <span data-start="1501.24" data-end="1507.83">This might be the right thing. Otherwise, it's pretty hard to explain. Why would you even do machine learning in the browser?

<p><span data-start="1690.72" data-end="1693.319">To a server and then you could train the general model</span> <span data-start="1694.11" data-end="1700.819">Upload it to this thing here.
