<p><span data-start="43.559" data-end="47.789">I am as mentioned from australia sydney</span> <span data-start="47.789" data-end="50.01">where we're probably known for our opera</span> <span data-start="50.01" data-end="52.71">house and our beer and I work out</span> <span data-start="52.71" data-end="54.649">atlassian where there's beer on tap</span> <span data-start="54.649" data-end="57.93">except I don't drink so I've been at</span> <span data-start="57.93" data-end="60.149">last year for the past five nearly six</span> <span data-start="60.149" data-end="62.28">years and I worked on various projects</span> <span data-start="62.28" data-end="64.68">and products in particular booked on</span> <span data-start="64.68" data-end="66.9">confluence some of you may have heard of</span> <span data-start="66.9" data-end="70.68">that now as a developer I think how jobs</span> <span data-start="70.68" data-end="73.56">are very creative and therefore I like</span> <span data-start="73.56" data-end="75.36">to create things and I think many of us</span> <span data-start="75.36" data-end="78.72">do here as well but I don't like to</span> <span data-start="78.72" data-end="81.72">create just computer programs and apps</span> <span data-start="81.72" data-end="84.09">in fact I like to sometimes venture away</span> <span data-start="84.09" data-end="86.22">from the computer and create things that</span> <span data-start="86.22" data-end="88.67">are a bit more tangible like soft toys</span> <span data-start="88.67" data-end="91.68">but I find in the end I gravitate back</span> <span data-start="91.68" data-end="93.75">towards the laptop sitting in my room</span> <span data-start="93.75" data-end="97.189">coding away at some random idea I have</span> <span data-start="97.189" data-end="100.68">so now that you know a bit about me let</span> <span data-start="100.68" data-end="104.61">us continue on our journey so before we</span> <span data-start="104.61" data-end="106.74">start on the journey let us start by</span> <span data-start="106.74" data-end="110.28">doing a quick survey with some audience</span> <span data-start="110.28" data-end="113.31">participation so put your hand up if</span> <span data-start="113.31" data-end="115.95">you've wanted to make a game or have an</span> <span data-start="115.95" data-end="120.42">idea for a game come on yep so quite a</span> <span data-start="120.42" data-end="123.54">few now keep your hand up if you started</span> <span data-start="123.54" data-end="127.37">on this idea</span> <span data-start="127.38" data-end="130.54">bit more and keep your hand up if you've</span> <span data-start="130.54" data-end="133.24">actually finished this idea and it's</span> <span data-start="133.24" data-end="135.28">published so that people who you do not</span> <span data-start="135.28" data-end="136.89">know can download and play this game</span> <span data-start="136.89" data-end="140.77">because I think we've got two people so</span> <span data-start="140.77" data-end="143.05">as you can see there's a bit of a</span> <span data-start="143.05" data-end="145.57">pattern here and that is as developers</span> <span data-start="145.57" data-end="148.09">we like creating things and gains is one</span> <span data-start="148.09" data-end="150.16">of these things and I think the reason</span> <span data-start="150.16" data-end="152.53">for this is games is one of the rare</span> <span data-start="152.53" data-end="154.45">things that we can create that our</span> <span data-start="154.45" data-end="157.6">friends and family understand it might</span> <span data-start="157.6" data-end="159.64">be quite hard to explain to your friend</span> <span data-start="159.64" data-end="163.39">what a web torrent web RTC thing is they</span> <span data-start="163.39" data-end="165.49">might be like so I can stream videos</span> <span data-start="165.49" data-end="168.07">like youtube what's the difference but</span> <span data-start="168.07" data-end="169.96">with games you give it to them and</span> <span data-start="169.96" data-end="171.52">they'll be like oh cool I can play</span> <span data-start="171.52" data-end="173.98">flappy bird they understand exactly what</span> <span data-start="173.98" data-end="176.11">it's for without you trying to dumb it</span> <span data-start="176.11" data-end="179.65">down for them but the problem is there's</span> <span data-start="179.65" data-end="181.99">lots of ideas and we rare that they</span> <span data-start="181.99" data-end="184.33">rarely see the light of day and I think</span> <span data-start="184.33" data-end="187.84">this is a huge problem mainly because as</span> <span data-start="187.84" data-end="190.09">developers I think we're all very</span> <span data-start="190.09" data-end="192.37">talented and skilled and we have the</span> <span data-start="192.37" data-end="194.41">ability to create these games that we</span> <span data-start="194.41" data-end="196.989">have in our mind but life gets in the</span> <span data-start="196.989" data-end="199.93">way and we rarely finish these ideas and</span> <span data-start="199.93" data-end="201.91">they just sort of either stay half</span> <span data-start="201.91" data-end="204.07">completed on a computer or worse yet</span> <span data-start="204.07" data-end="207.459">they stay in our mind going nowhere and</span> <span data-start="207.459" data-end="209.86">that is why today I want you to I want</span> <span data-start="209.86" data-end="212.68">to I guess talk to you about my</span> <span data-start="212.68" data-end="214.69">experience in making my most recent game</span> <span data-start="214.69" data-end="218.08">trichrome on so try chroma is a simple</span> <span data-start="218.08" data-end="220.66">puzzle game where you slide the tiles</span> <span data-start="220.66" data-end="223.9">around you when you slide the tiles</span> <span data-start="223.9" data-end="225.58">around and you have three or more of the</span> <span data-start="225.58" data-end="228.04">same color that line up the tiles</span> <span data-start="228.04" data-end="230.47">disappear if you clear the board you</span> <span data-start="230.47" data-end="232.42">level up you get a new color it gets</span> <span data-start="232.42" data-end="235.239">hard up if the board feels up it's game</span> <span data-start="235.239" data-end="238.269">over start again as you can see it's a</span> <span data-start="238.269" data-end="240.28">very simple game it's completely written</span> <span data-start="240.28" data-end="243.97">in JavaScript HTML CSS and I use Cordova</span> <span data-start="243.97" data-end="246.76">to make it a native web app now I have</span> <span data-start="246.76" data-end="248.44">to give it a quick plug it is available</span> <span data-start="248.44" data-end="250.39">on the Google Play Store which is why</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="329.86" data-end="333.13">JavaScript done in a weekend and I can</span> <span data-start="333.13" data-end="334.69">promise you your code is going to be</span> <span data-start="334.69" data-end="337.12">horrible it's a prototype it should be</span> <span data-start="337.12" data-end="339.91">trachoma had global variables I had</span> <span data-start="339.91" data-end="342.28">hard-coded parameters there were bugs</span> <span data-start="342.28" data-end="343.96">but I could have fixed them because the</span> <span data-start="343.96" data-end="346.33">code was so fragile but that didn't</span> <span data-start="346.33" data-end="348.12">matter because a key thing for the</span> <span data-start="348.12" data-end="350.98">prototype is you want to validate two</span> <span data-start="350.98" data-end="354.34">things firstly you want to validate that</span> <span data-start="354.34" data-end="356.95">your idea works and secondly you want to</span> <span data-start="356.95" data-end="359.22">validate that it's technically possible</span> <span data-start="359.22" data-end="361.96">so in terms of idea you want to make</span> <span data-start="361.96" data-end="365.85">sure your idea actually has some legs as</span> <span data-start="365.85" data-end="369.34">harsh as it sounds many of our ideas are</span> <span data-start="369.34" data-end="373.12">actually pretty crap so you want to</span> <span data-start="373.12" data-end="375.19">create something quick and dirty that</span> <span data-start="375.19" data-end="377.53">you can prove that your idea actually</span> <span data-start="377.53" data-end="381.49">makes sense and on top of this once you</span> <span data-start="381.49" data-end="382.99">have something in front of you you can</span> <span data-start="382.99" data-end="384.669">give it to your friend or your flatmate</span> <span data-start="384.669" data-end="386.71">and they can play with it and tell you</span> <span data-start="386.71" data-end="388.3">if they think it makes sense</span> <span data-start="388.3" data-end="391.18">if they think it looks promising and if</span> <span data-start="391.18" data-end="392.83">it passes this test you know you've got</span> <span data-start="392.83" data-end="394.389">something that you can spend more time</span> <span data-start="394.389" data-end="397.72">with the second thing is validating if</span> <span data-start="397.72" data-end="399.94">it's technically possible now of course</span> <span data-start="399.94" data-end="403.15">in this day and age it's very rare to</span> <span data-start="403.15" data-end="404.59">have something that is technically</span> <span data-start="404.59" data-end="408.61">impossible right it's we can do almost</span> <span data-start="408.61" data-end="411.31">anything we want but the question is</span> <span data-start="411.31" data-end="413.77">more so can you finish this project by</span> <span data-start="413.77" data-end="415.539">yourself or maybe with a friend as</span> <span data-start="415.539" data-end="418.599">you'll notice try chroma is very very</span> <span data-start="418.599" data-end="421.419">simple it is very basically no graphics</span> <span data-start="421.419" data-end="423.61">in fact it's just a bunch of colored</span> <span data-start="423.61" data-end="426.039">rectangles and that is because I can't</span> <span data-start="426.039" data-end="429.639">draw to save my life I wanted to write a</span>

data-end="440.919">because apparently my choices were</span> <span data-start="440.919" data-end="444.039">horrible so now that you've validated</span> <span data-start="444.039" data-end="446.86">your idea is promising and you feel that</span> <span data-start="446.86" data-end="448.949">you can technically make this possible</span> <span data-start="448.949" data-end="451.81">you're on to your real adventure and</span> <span data-start="451.81" data-end="456.34">that is creating the real thing now when</span> <span data-start="456.34"

data-end="835.88">because games have a lot of change in</span> <span data-start="835.88" data-end="837.74">them and if you have a suite of tests</span> <span data-start="837.74" data-end="839.78">that

together so the reason for this is</span> <span data-start="861.62" data-end="864.41">games have rules rules are</span> <span data-start="864.41" data-end="867.32">specifications and tet specifications</span> <span data-start="867.32" data-end="869.63">lend themselves extremely well to tests</span> <span data-start="869.63" data-end="871.73">in fact if you think of the jasmine</span> <span data-start="871.73" data-end="873.49">testing framework it gets you to write</span> <span data-start="873.49" data-end="876.86">specifications and not tests so as an</span> <span

data-start="882.71" data-end="885.29">as you can see this translates pretty</span> <span data-start="885.29" data-end="889.61">much exactly to as jasmine test you</span> <span data-start="889.61" data-end="891.5">described that the grid should know when</span> <span data-start="891.5" data-end="893.42">it's full because this means you need to</span> <span data-start="893.42"

data-end="900.53">know when it's empty because this time</span> <span data-start="900.53" data-end="902.15">you need to do something about leveling</span> <span data-start="902.15"
