data-end="730.65">that's cool so I'm going to try and use</span> <span data-start="730.65" data-end="733.29">i'm going to fly this thing this way</span> <span data-start="733.29" data-end="735.42">conceivably all the landing platforms</span> <span data-start="735.42" data-end="737.25">are that way i'm going to try and fly it</span> <span data-start="737.25" data-end="738.66">that way and then if i see a lady</span> <span data-start="738.66" data-end="740.22">platform i'm going to try and interact</span> <span data-start="740.22" data-end="742.49">with it and get it to let me land on it</span> <span data-start="742.49" data-end="745.62">so let's see you can't really see it</span> <span data-start="745.62" data-end="747.39">very well but you can see my x and y</span> <span data-start="747.39" data-end="748.12">coordinates up here</span> <span data-start="748.12" data-end="750.4">she doesn't really look like I'm moving</span> <span data-start="750.4" data-end="752.89">but you have to just take my word for it</span> <span data-start="752.89" data-end="756.25">that we are fly oh look there's one okay</span> <span data-start="756.25" data-end="758.83">so here's the landing platform let's get</span> <span data-start="758.83" data-end="761.26">a cool right for anybody that's a big</span> <span data-start="761.26"

actually one of the most fun games</span> <span data-start="785.65" data-end="788.46">ever so if anybody has an Atari ST</span> <span data-start="788.46" data-end="790.42">definitely should go on ebay and try and</span> <span data-start="790.42" data-end="793.839">get a copy of skies drinker anyway so I</span> <span data-start="793.839" data-end="795.7">see this little any platform here that's</span> <span data-start="795.7" data-end="798.97">cool I see kind of its kind of receive</span> <span data-start="798.97" data-end="801.1">it it has what Portland like what</span> <span data-start="801.1" data-end="803.02">localhost and what port it's listening</span> <span data-start="803.02" data-end="805.96">in so it's listening on 3006 that's cool</span> <span data-start="805.96" data-end="808.42">so if I click on it it's actually going</span> <span data-start="808.42" data-end="813.91">to open up the API for that that's</span> <span data-start="813.91" data-end="816.4">another feature of obviously this is not</span> <span data-start="816.4" data-end="820.54">jason another feature of rest that a lot</span> <span data-start="820.54" data-end="822.67">of people tend to neglect is content</span> <span data-start="822.67" data-end="827.86">type negotiation so really you should be</span> <span data-start="827.86" data-end="829.39">able to serve back content in whatever</span> <span data-start="829.39" data-end="832.15">format the the client wants and then</span> <span data-start="832.15" data-end="833.44">there's obviously you're not going to</span> <span data-start="833.44" data-end="835.33">always be able to do that like I didn't</span> <span data-start="835.33" data-end="838.27">take the time to write a something to</span> <span data-start="838.27" data-end="840.94">convert the stacks ml but I did write</span> <span data-start="840.94" data-end="842.68">something to converge a sin to HTML</span> <span data-start="842.68" data-end="845.64">which is what enables me to look at this</span> <span data-start="845.64" data-end="848.92">so that's pretty cool and if that's like</span> <span data-start="848.92" data-end="850.839">another takeaway that of things that you</span> <span data-start="850.839" data-end="852.43">should probably do any rest api is this</span> <span data-start="852.43" data-end="855.55">is another thing also version like side</span> <span data-start="855.55" data-end="858.1">note versioning don't put that into our</span> <span data-start="858.1" data-end="862.959">i put it in the accepts like india the</span> <span data-start="862.959" data-end="865.36">content type that you specify it's much</span> <span data-start="865.36" data-end="868.36">easier okay so anyway we see the</span> <span data-start="868.36" data-end="869.8">representation of the api for the</span> <span data-start="869.8" data-end="871.6">specific landing platform that's that</span> <span data-start="871.6" data-end="874.089">guy so we're going to try and see what's</span> <span data-start="874.089" data-end="875.92">going on with this guy again I don't</span> <span data-start="875.92" data-end="877.78">have any preconceptions about what ap is</span> <span data-start="877.78" data-end="879.73">this thing exposes</span> <span data-start="879.73" data-end="882.399">um but we can see that make it a little</span> <span data-start="882.399" data-end="884.62">bigger there's looks like there's a way</span> <span data-start="884.62" data-end="887.25">to get the position of this thing</span> <span data-start="887.25" data-end="893.17">negative 3822 rotas worth that's pretty</span> <span data-start="893.17" data-end="895.329">cool I'll look there's something called</span> <span data-start="895.329" data-end="898.709">landing requests that sounds topical</span> <span data-start="898.709" data-end="900.43">requests the land on this particular</span> <span data-start="900.43" data-end="904.42">boat I think I could use that and it</span> <span data-start="904.42" data-end="906.01">shows me what methods i can do so i can</span> <span data-start="906.01" data-end="908.139">post to it and actually create a landing</span> <span data-start="908.139" data-end="910.18">requests conceivably so i guess that's</span> <span data-start="910.18" data-end="912.91">what i would do if i were to land it</span> <span data-start="912.91" data-end="915.31">even shows me what parameters that</span> <span data-start="915.31" data-end="917.86">expects in order for me to to submit to</span> <span data-start="917.86" data-end="919.149">that so that's pretty cool so i think</span> <span data-start="919.149" data-end="922.6">based on this I know how to interact</span> <span data-start="922.6" data-end="924.339">with this thing I know how to get to let</span> <span data-start="924.339" data-end="928.449">me land on it but you know what this is</span> <span data-start="928.449" data-end="930.01">not really very interesting aircraft</span> <span data-start="930.01" data-end="931.63">carrier let's keep going and see if we</span> <span data-start="931.63" data-end="933.01">can find a cooler one I hope I don't</span> <span data-start="933.01" data-end="935.91">though randomly like where they spawn is</span> <span data-start="935.91" data-end="938.529">the randomly assigned so sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="938.529" data-end="940.75">like okay we didn't have to wait too</span> <span data-start="940.75" data-end="943.139">long oh well we could say it's a</span> <span data-start="943.139"
