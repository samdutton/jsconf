data-end="1018.279">power is being cut off the record is</span> <span data-start="1018.279" data-end="1021.1">lost forever and has a big problem</span> <span data-start="1021.1" data-end="1023.079">because I think a lot of applications</span> <span data-start="1023.079" data-end="1025.329">actually have mixed needs they have data</span> <span data-start="1025.329" data-end="1027.49">that needs to be really transactional</span> <span data-start="1027.49" data-end="1029.11">you say it's stored it needs to be</span> <span data-start="1029.11" data-end="1030.579">stored and a lot of other stuff you</span> <span data-start="1030.579" data-end="1031.99">don't care if you lose a record here</span> <span data-start="1031.99" data-end="1034.72">there and what you can do with nodes</span> <span data-start="1034.72" data-end="1037.39">thanks to non-blocking i/o is you can</span> <span data-start="1037.39" data-end="1040.809">set your key value pair and as soon as</span> <span data-start="1040.809" data-end="1041.949">you said it it's written to the object</span> <span data-start="1041.949" data-end="1043.99">you can access it again that's the</span> <span data-start="1043.99" data-end="1046.15">console log record written to memory</span> <span data-start="1046.15" data-end="1048.79">down there and then you get a call back</span> <span data-start="1048.79" data-end="1050.47">when it's actually flushed to disk so</span> <span data-start="1050.47" data-end="1052.66">you can get both events you can get okay</span> <span data-start="1052.66" data-end="1054.4">it's ready to be worked with part of a</span> <span data-start="1054.4" data-end="1055.13">query</span> <span data-start="1055.13" data-end="1056.99">and it's ready to this so if you reboot</span> <span data-start="1056.99" data-end="1060.56">me it will still be there I think that's</span> <span data-start="1060.56" data-end="1063.17">really interesting concepts that is</span> <span data-start="1063.17" data-end="1064.97">would be really difficult to pull off</span> <span data-start="1064.97" data-end="1067.19">with any other embedded database</span> <span data-start="1067.19" data-end="1073.88">technology well by the way what I also</span> <span data-start="1073.88" data-end="1075.14">wanted to talk about how this actually</span> <span data-start="1075.14" data-end="1079.43">works internally so right mechanism of</span> <span data-start="1079.43" data-end="1081.41">dirty works that whenever a record has</span> <span data-start="1081.41" data-end="1082.79">written it starts flashing it to disk</span> <span data-start="1082.79" data-end="1084.53">right away and then if there's more</span> <span data-start="1084.53" data-end="1086.66">records written with the set function</span> <span data-start="1086.66" data-end="1089">and the disk is still busy flushing the</span> <span data-start="1089" data-end="1091.22">first record it cues them all up so</span> <span data-start="1091.22" data-end="1094.01">basically the when the first record is</span> <span data-start="1094.01" data-end="1095.57">written to disk it looks at the back</span> <span data-start="1095.57" data-end="1097.82">loss lock of maybe 1,000 items and says</span> <span data-start="1097.82" data-end="1099.26">okay now I'm taking all of these</span> <span data-start="1099.26" data-end="1100.85">chunking them to get them to long</span> <span data-start="1100.85" data-end="1102.95">tracing string and writes that so all</span> <span data-start="1102.95" data-end="1104.44">your rights are pretty much instantly</span> <span data-start="1104.44" data-end="1107.9">which with red us I think depend only</span> <span data-start="1107.9" data-end="1110.09">lock the I don't know I think they have</span> <span data-start="1110.09" data-end="1111.92">two mechanisms now but I think one of</span> <span data-start="1111.92" data-end="1114.08">them was to basically do it every one</span> <span data-start="1114.08" data-end="1115.73">second or three seconds or something</span> <span data-start="1115.73" data-end="1118.55">which you don't really have to you can</span> <span data-start="1118.55" data-end="1120.65">use a queue when the disk is busy or</span> <span data-start="1120.65" data-end="1122.78">write to disk when it's doing nothing I</span> <span data-start="1122.78" data-end="1126.53">think this say have field change yeah</span> <span data-start="1126.53" data-end="1130.45">okay so that let get it better um</span> <span data-start="1130.45" data-end="1133.61">alright memory and disk high prints I</span> <span data-start="1133.61" data-end="1135.56">think one thing I could really imagine</span> <span data-start="1135.56" data-end="1139.1">this kind of databases to do is to be</span> <span data-start="1139.1" data-end="1140.42">mixture of a database and your</span> <span data-start="1140.42" data-end="1143.81">application so you might have some basic</span> <span data-start="1143.81" data-end="1146.27">libraries to do data solve data kind of</span> <span data-start="1146.27" data-end="1148.22">general data kind of problems for you</span> <span data-start="1148.22" data-end="1149.84">but then you can also build memcache</span> <span data-start="1149.84" data-end="1151.55">basically into it you don't have to</span> <span data-start="1151.55" data-end="1154.28">clear your database and query an awesome</span> <span data-start="1154.28" data-end="1155.96">memcached instance just to keep</span> <span data-start="1155.96" data-end="1157.76">something very fresh and hot you can</span> <span data-start="1157.76" data-end="1159.71">actually have your database do the</span> <span data-start="1159.71" data-end="1161.75">caching itself and you can't really do</span> <span data-start="1161.75" data-end="1163.25">that with other databases that easily</span> <span data-start="1163.25" data-end="1165.02">because as a databases they don't know</span> <span data-start="1165.02" data-end="1167.48">about your data but if you use about</span> <span data-start="1167.48" data-end="1170.77">your specific knowledge about your data</span> <span data-start="1170.77" data-end="1173.81">replication I think you could build up</span> <span data-start="1173.81" data-end="1176.03">really nicely replicating data base with</span> <span data-start="1176.03" data-end="1178.61">no chairs just because it's perfect for</span> <span data-start="1178.61" data-end="1180.26">streaming I mean streaming is one of the</span> <span data-start="1180.26" data-end="1182.57">main points of why node exists every</span> <span data-start="1182.57" data-end="1184.49">other that technology kind of was fast</span> <span data-start="1184.49" data-end="1187.28">before and was kind of usable but none</span> <span data-start="1187.28" data-end="1188.64">of them made it really easy to</span> <span data-start="1188.64" data-end="1190.08">stream and still do something else at</span> <span data-start="1190.08" data-end="1192">the same time request responses where</span> <span data-start="1192" data-end="1194.55">looked at at a singular event you get a</span> <span data-start="1194.55" data-end="1196.23">request he process it is that a response</span> <span data-start="1196.23" data-end="1198.18">but there's nothing in between with note</span> <span data-start="1198.18" data-end="1201.6">streaming is really easy and also</span> <span data-start="1201.6" data-end="1203.85">another thing that's really easy with in</span> <span data-start="1203.85" data-end="1206.07">regards to that it snowed could hold an</span> <span data-start="1206.07" data-end="1209.67">incoming connection if a replicated key</span> <span data-start="1209.67" data-end="1212.76">or if a not yet replicated key is being</span> <span data-start="1212.76" data-end="1214.95">requested what that means is some of</span> <span data-start="1214.95" data-end="1216.3">your clients rights to one of your</span> <span data-start="1216.3" data-end="1218.43">database servers in the cluster and then</span> <span data-start="1218.43" data-end="1220.29">another client goes and asks another</span> <span data-start="1220.29" data-end="1222.45">instance of the same database class sir</span> <span data-start="1222.45" data-end="1224.07">for that key but the key has not</span> <span data-start="1224.07" data-end="1226.08">replicated yet well note could actually</span> <span data-start="1226.08" data-end="1229.14">say if I get a request in for keys that</span> <span data-start="1229.14" data-end="1230.97">does not exist I wait for three seconds</span> <span data-start="1230.97" data-end="1232.89">if it still comes in my answers a</span> <span data-start="1232.89" data-end="1235.08">request as soon as I can meanwhile I let</span> <span data-start="1235.08" data-end="1236.67">the connection hang I think said</span> <span data-start="1236.67" data-end="1238.53">something where you could build really</span> <span data-start="1238.53" data-end="1240.48">small systems that don't have to take</span> <span data-start="1240.48" data-end="1242.01">the eventual consistency trade-off</span> <span data-start="1242.01" data-end="1244.08">there's a lot of our systems take just</span> <span data-start="1244.08" data-end="1246.12">by saying yeah we'll do eventual</span> <span data-start="1246.12" data-end="1249.21">consistency but we can also hold a query</span> <span data-start="1249.21" data-end="1251.04">for three seconds if we have a hopes</span> <span data-start="1251.04" data-end="1253.16">that it's still being successfully</span> <span data-start="1253.16" data-end="1257.73">executed in three seconds later web</span> <span data-start="1257.73" data-end="1260.7">services you could also use no chess to</span> <span data-start="1260.7" data-end="1263.1">act as a proxy for different database</span> <span data-start="1263.1" data-end="1265.62">beckons because I don't believe one</span> <span data-start="1265.62" data-end="1267.12">database is ever going to solve all your</span> <span data-start="1267.12" data-end="1268.44">problems and fix everything especially</span> <span data-start="1268.44" data-end="1270.63">when you go to a certain scale but it</span> <span data-start="1270.63" data-end="1271.89">would be really nice to have a unified</span> <span data-start="1271.89" data-end="1273.48">interface for your business questions</span> <span data-start="1273.48" data-end="1275.31">that your your clients are asking and</span> <span data-start="1275.31" data-end="1277.11">your cloud that's going to answer and I</span> <span data-start="1277.11" data-end="1278.76">think no chairs could make a really nice</span> <span data-start="1278.76" data-end="1281.13">clue in between maybe some oh no</span> <span data-start="1281.13" data-end="1283.14">database or maybe not talking to a couch</span> <span data-start="1283.14" data-end="1284.91">to be talking to rat us back end and</span> <span data-start="1284.91" data-end="1287.07">just shifting this data together but</span> <span data-start="1287.07" data-end="1288.12">also knowing about your business</span> <span data-start="1288.12" data-end="1289.89">problems combining the data properly</span> <span data-start="1289.89" data-end="1292.02">doing good cashing it kind of makes it</span> <span data-start="1292.02" data-end="1294.54">act as a layer in between and you could</span> <span data-start="1294.54" data-end="1296.67">even like query third-party services if</span> <span data-start="1296.67" data-end="1297.84">you're building something really big</span> <span data-start="1297.84" data-end="1299.01">that depends on a bunch of other</span> <span data-start="1299.01" data-end="1300.93">business processes somewhere else your</span> <span data-start="1300.93" data-end="1302.79">database could directly take that into</span> <span data-start="1302.79" data-end="1307.14">account as well um yeah so that's the</span> <span data-start="1307.14" data-end="1309.06">basic thing and I think there will be a</span> <span data-start="1309.06" data-end="1311.76">lot of questions about this kind of</span> <span data-start="1311.76" data-end="1313.77">crazy experiment I hope so we're period</span> <span data-start="1313.77" data-end="1315.72">good idea soon but i'm also open to hear</span> <span data-start="1315.72" data-end="1339.94">any that's a really bad ones</span> <span data-start="1339.95" data-end="1344.91">okay yeah you just put an if statement</span> <span data-start="1344.91" data-end="1346.26">and say if I under such a question</span> <span data-start="1346.26" data-end="1367.41">properly if DD</span> <span data-start="1367.42" data-end="1369.59">basically says when you get and set</span> <span data-start="1369.59" data-end="1372.47">there's no I Oh happening with with</span> <span data-start="1372.47" data-end="1374.15">dirty it's clearly in memory and the</span> <span data-start="1374.15" data-end="1377.36">only iOS that happens it's actually flat</span> <span data-start="1377.36" data-end="1381.48">flashing the record to disk eventually</span> <span data-start="1381.49" data-end="1383.66">well there's no network interface you</span> <span data-start="1383.66" data-end="1384.89">have no other way of getting at the</span> <span data-start="1384.89" data-end="1391.96">database from the outside right so baby</span> <span data-start="1391.96" data-end="1401.39">yep no i think i had i didn't have 50</span> <span data-start="1401.39" data-end="1402.68">million records in the database because</span> <span data-start="1402.68" data-end="1405.44">there's a problem with v8 right now be 8</span> <span data-start="1405.44" data-end="1407.86">caps you at one gigabyte of heap usage</span> <span

data-start="1417.32" data-end="1419.72">store numbers as key value pairs and so</span> <span data-start="1419.72" data-end="1421.22">the rest is going to be filled up by</span> <span

data-start="1425.18" data-end="1427.49">get benchmark was also just 1 million</span> <span data-start="1427.49" data-end="1430.01">maybe 1 or 10 million records and the</span> <span data-start="1430.01" data-end="1432.74">keys and sibelius where numbers so that</span> <span data-start="1432.74" data-end="1434.51">was the only thing going on I can</span> <span data-start="1434.51" data-end="1441.82">actually show the code for the benchmark</span> <span data-start="1441.83" data-end="1447.96">yeah but the main point of the benchmark</span> <span data-start="1447.96" data-end="1450.63">was to see okay you can get a key which</span> <span data-start="1450.63" data-end="1452.19">is cutting performance in half at this</span> <span data-start="1452.19" data-end="1453.6">speed they're still pretty accessible</span> <span data-start="1453.6" data-end="1455.61">acceptable for having so many function</span> <span data-start="1455.61" data-end="1457.32">calls I mean the 10 million function</span> <span data-start="1457.32" data-end="1460.17">colt so that's pretty good and one</span> <span data-start="1460.17" data-end="1461.76">lesson maybe to be learned from that as</span> <span data-start="1461.76" data-end="1463.38">if you're writing note code was a ton of</span> <span data-start="1463.38" data-end="1465.18">callbacks and you're like and all those</span> <span data-start="1465.18" data-end="1466.38">functions are going to slow my coat down</span> <span data-start="1466.38" data-end="1468.6">now you'll need a lot of functions to do</span> <span data-start="1468.6" data-end="1476.52">that a lot of function calls yep what</span> <span data-start="1476.52" data-end="1484.02">function ya know for each it's not the</span> <span data-start="1484.02" data-end="1491.7">native JavaScript for each it's yeah I</span> <span data-start="1491.7" data-end="1493.11">think that was 1 million records and</span> <span data-start="1493.11" data-end="1495.99">it's basically using for bar in which</span> <span data-start="1495.99" data-end="1498.72">i'm going to replace with the array list</span> <span data-start="1498.72" data-end="1505.49">of keys i think yeah</span> <span data-start="1505.5" data-end="1516.42">oh yeah you shouldn't use you shouldn't</span> <span data-start="1516.42" data-end="1518.4">try to evaluate this against Redis</span> <span data-start="1518.4" data-end="1519.81">unless you're planning to have a
