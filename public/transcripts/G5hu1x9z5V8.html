data-end="1333.55">predict what all the relationships will</span> <span data-start="1333.55" data-end="1335.919">be it triggers notification so you have</span> <span data-start="1335.919" data-end="1337.539">nice UI binding</span> <span data-start="1337.539" data-end="1339.249">and as we just saw it sort of is smart</span> <span data-start="1339.249" data-end="1340.899">enough to discard the future history</span> <span data-start="1340.899" data-end="1345.549">that you are no longer going to see we</span> <span data-start="1345.549" data-end="1347.139">have this idea of moving in time which</span> <span data-start="1347.139" data-end="1349.359">is which is kind of fundamental to these</span> <span data-start="1349.359" data-end="1350.619">models and something I think that's</span> <span data-start="1350.619" data-end="1352.72">interestingly different from a sort of</span> <span data-start="1352.72" data-end="1354.369">standard web app so you can they</span> <span data-start="1354.369" data-end="1356.529">progress in time and so when you move on</span> <span data-start="1356.529" data-end="1358.09">in time we sort of assume everything is</span> <span data-start="1358.09" data-end="1359.559">going to change so we just notify</span> <span data-start="1359.559" data-end="1363.58">everything and the last thing is this</span> <span data-start="1363.58" data-end="1365.799">these properties give you this neat idea</span> <span data-start="1365.799" data-end="1368.71">of parameters so parameters is soon UI</span> <span data-start="1368.71" data-end="1372.399">stuff you saw me manipulating in the in</span> <span data-start="1372.399" data-end="1374.2">the pendulum demo their properties too</span> <span data-start="1374.2" data-end="1376.09">and they just all they do is trigger an</span> <span data-start="1376.09" data-end="1378.279">action it can be a real ugly action to</span> <span data-start="1378.279" data-end="1379.869">make the model state somehow like match</span> <span data-start="1379.869" data-end="1383.109">their value like by updating the</span> <span data-start="1383.109" data-end="1384.879">gravitational field it'll make things</span> <span data-start="1384.879" data-end="1386.739">act as if the gravitational field this</span> <span data-start="1386.739" data-end="1395.679">is larger and so here's a really simple</span> <span data-start="1395.679" data-end="1397.84">model it's showing like this piston is</span> <span data-start="1397.84" data-end="1399.94">pushing in and these these molecules are</span> <span data-start="1399.94" data-end="1401.379">bouncing around well what if i add a</span> <span data-start="1401.379" data-end="1403.479">whole bunch of atoms i can just move</span> <span data-start="1403.479" data-end="1405.609">that slider and suddenly any ugly old</span> <span data-start="1405.609" data-end="1407.169">color i want that makes more atoms show</span> <span data-start="1407.169" data-end="1410.83">up we'll make actually make more answer</span> <span data-start="1410.83" data-end="1412.539">up and you'll see you'll bump up the</span> <span data-start="1412.539" data-end="1414.549">volume of the thing well if I go back in</span> <span data-start="1414.549"

data-end="1425.229">move backwards well i got on my a nose</span> <span data-start="1425.229" data-end="1427.149">back and I can play forward what I did</span> <span data-start="1427.149" data-end="1429.159">so if I actually really liked having 60</span> <span data-start="1429.159" data-end="1430.149">items and something really interesting</span> <span data-start="1430.149" data-end="1432.129">what's happening here I could I could</span> <span data-start="1432.129" data-end="1436.72">show that and so I just think it's a</span> <span data-start="1436.72"
