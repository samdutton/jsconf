data-end="870.3">we thought it would be cool to make it</span> <span data-start="870.3" data-end="873.87">work like that what we realize is we</span> <span data-start="873.87" data-end="875.16">need these people to have the</span> <span data-start="875.16" data-end="876.839">information within a call center</span> <span data-start="876.839" data-end="879.029">available as soon as possible and

data-end="897.959">information will get back to the other</span> <span data-start="897.959" data-end="902.069">call centers actually that allow us to</span> <span data-start="902.069"

data-start="916.38" data-end="921.77">and replicas late on only what you need</span> <span data-start="921.77" data-end="924.72">a second very common problem if you are</span> <span data-start="924.72" data-end="926.22">dealing with offline applications is</span> <span data-start="926.22" data-end="928.38">dealing with conflicts why do I mean by</span> <span data-start="928.38" data-end="933.45">conflicts this was our original data</span> <span data-start="933.45" data-end="935.64">model in the database and so we have the</span> <span data-start="935.64" data-end="937.31">remote database and to contact tracers</span> <span data-start="937.31" data-end="939.72">let's assume for simplicity that they</span> <span data-start="939.72" data-end="943.26">only synchronize data at night so we</span> <span data-start="943.26" data-end="945.36">have day to both contact tracers have</span> <span data-start="945.36" data-end="948.03">the

therefore the</span> <span data-start="954.57" data-end="956.13">second coat that tracer goes to follow</span> <span data-start="956.13" data-end="958.92">up on that person and at night internet</span> <span data-start="958.92" data-end="960.54">works again and they try to synchronize</span> <span data-start="960.54" data-end="965.16">and Cal Stevie says okay guys I have a</span> <span data-start="965.16" data-end="967.47">document you both have modify it I have</span> <span data-start="967.47" data-end="970.77">no idea which one of you is right so I'm</span> <span data-start="970.77" data-end="972.51">just going to set up this has set this</span> <span data-start="972.51" data-end="974.51">as a conflict and it's for you to decide</span> <span data-start="974.51" data-end="977.01">you can do that you can decide what's</span> <span data-start="977.01" data-end="979.29">the right information but you can do</span> <span data-start="979.29" data-end="981.21">even better by avoiding completes all</span> <span data-start="981.21" data-end="985.14">together so what if you design your data</span> <span data-start="985.14" data-end="987.3">model better and keep things that change</span> <span data-start="987.3" data-end="989.64">together together and things that change</span> <span data-start="989.64" data-end="993.089">separated separated this way each one of</span> <span data-start="993.089" data-end="994.98">the contact tracers will only create new</span> <span data-start="994.98" data-end="996.96">documents and then there will never be</span> <span data-start="996.96" data-end="1001.79">conflicts this will have another bonus</span> <span data-start="1001.79" data-end="1004.01">that is like there is less versions to</span> <span data-start="1004.01" data-end="1006.35">maintain because you are not editing the</span> <span data-start="1006.35" data-end="1009.35">documents all the time so that makes a</span> <span data-start="1009.35" data-end="1012.52">replication faster and takes lazy space</span> <span data-start="1012.52" data-end="1015.62">so for avoiding conflicts choose your</span> <span data-start="1015.62" data-end="1020.63">data model wisely the third problem I</span> <span data-start="1020.63" data-end="1024.829">want to tell you about is a nightmare of</span> <span data-start="1024.829" data-end="1026.689">somebody making offline applications</span> <span data-start="1026.689"
