<p><span data-start="32.32" data-end="35.84">hello I'm Nick I'm from Shopify like</span> <span data-start="35.84" data-end="38.21">Brendan said and I'm here to talk about</span> <span data-start="38.21" data-end="40.69">yet another JavaScript micro framework</span> <span data-start="40.69" data-end="43.07">there are people a lot smarter than me</span> <span data-start="43.07" data-end="45.02">and I'll probably manage to pitts a good</span> <span data-start="45.02" data-end="48.35">number of them off today but my bullshit</span> <span data-start="48.35" data-end="49.85">title at Shopify means that I get to</span> <span data-start="49.85" data-end="51.29">play with JavaScript frameworks all day</span> <span data-start="51.29" data-end="56.36">long and it's awesome so let's talk</span> <span data-start="56.36" data-end="60.47">about frameworks we want to build great</span> <span data-start="60.47" data-end="64.04">web apps that that can mean web apps or</span> <span data-start="64.04" data-end="66.74">embedded apps or no taps or anything</span> <span data-start="66.74" data-end="69.229">else that people like all of you are</span> <span data-start="69.229" data-end="73.399">going to build but talking specifically</span> <span data-start="73.399" data-end="75.68">about web apps it's important to to</span> <span data-start="75.68" data-end="77.539">decide what kind of web apps we want to</span> <span data-start="77.539" data-end="79.97">build so this is an old cappuccino slide</span> <span data-start="79.97" data-end="82.52">that I really like it's about the</span> <span data-start="82.52" data-end="84.32">spectrum of different kinds of web apps</span> <span data-start="84.32" data-end="85.789">on the left you've got really simple</span> <span data-start="85.789" data-end="88.64">just text document based pages and all</span> <span data-start="88.64" data-end="91.25">the way to the right you have desktop</span> <span data-start="91.25" data-end="93.02">style applications like cappuccino</span> <span data-start="93.02" data-end="97.909">builds like 280 slides so frameworks</span> <span data-start="97.909" data-end="101.21">like backbone are aiming more towards</span> <span data-start="101.21" data-end="103.189">kind of to the right somewhere between</span> <span data-start="103.189" data-end="105.08">something like Facebook and something</span> <span data-start="105.08" data-end="107.27">like 20 G slides where you have a fair</span> <span data-start="107.27" data-end="108.77">amount of interaction but not</span> <span data-start="108.77" data-end="110.869">necessarily the fully stated model that</span> <span data-start="110.869" data-end="112.729">you would have with a full desktop</span> <span data-start="112.729" data-end="117.259">application the problem is is that</span> <span data-start="117.259" data-end="119.36">building these kinds of apps is still</span> <span data-start="119.36" data-end="121.4">really hard there are a lot of moving</span> <span data-start="121.4" data-end="123.829">parts involved and complexity explodes</span> <span data-start="123.829" data-end="125.18">for anything but the simplest of</span> <span data-start="125.18" data-end="128.119">applications so at Shopify we have a</span> <span data-start="128.119" data-end="130.519">really big app to implement like</span> <span data-start="130.519" data-end="132.709">seriously this thing is huge hundreds of</span> <span data-start="132.709" data-end="138.47">endpoints and models and routes and Ajax</span> <span data-start="138.47" data-end="140.93">requests I mean things pretty crazy and</span> <span data-start="140.93" data-end="143.23">so the complexity involved is</span> <span data-start="143.23" data-end="148.1">mind-blowing what we wanted to make it</span> <span data-start="148.1" data-end="150.769">work so my job is to sit there like a</span> <span data-start="150.769" data-end="152.209">monkey had a typewriter and figure out</span> <span data-start="152.209" data-end="155.9">how we can make that happen but the</span> <span data-start="155.9" data-end="157.519">thing you need to understand is that I</span> <span data-start="157.519" data-end="159.5">am the only JavaScript developer at a</span> <span data-start="159.5" data-end="164.06">company full of Ruby developers that's</span> <span data-start="164.06" data-end="165.83">that's the important thing to understand</span> <span data-start="165.83" data-end="167.6">for this story so I started implementing</span> <span data-start="167.6" data-end="170.66">shop fight as a nap in backbone and</span> <span data-start="170.66" data-end="173.75">backbones pretty awesome yeah so I was</span> <span data-start="173.75" data-end="175.58">able to get a few tasks working really</span> <span data-start="175.58" data-end="178.16">quickly I was I was impressed I showed</span> <span data-start="178.16" data-end="180.17">it to everyone else they understood the</span> <span data-start="180.17" data-end="182.84">code they also were impressed but</span> <span data-start="182.84" data-end="184.58">something didn't seem to compute for</span> <span data-start="184.58" data-end="187.73">them even more importantly was designers</span> <span data-start="187.73" data-end="189.02">we have a team of really talented</span> <span data-start="189.02" data-end="191.54">designers but showing them this giant</span> <span data-start="191.54" data-end="193.94">javascript file where they basically</span> <span data-start="193.94" data-end="196.7">render their views in JavaScript code</span> <span data-start="196.7" data-end="199.7">not going to happen you show a designer</span> <span data-start="199.7" data-end="201.29">a bunch of JavaScript code they will</span> <span data-start="201.29" data-end="206.99">punch you in the face so we wanted</span> <span data-start="206.99" data-end="209.99">something that doesn't make designers</span> <span data-start="209.99" data-end="211.16">write a bunch of code that lets them</span> <span data-start="211.16" data-end="212.51">work in the tools that they're familiar</span> <span data-start="212.51" data-end="217.19">with I played with everything all of</span> <span data-start="217.19" data-end="219.8">these frameworks are great I love them</span> <span data-start="219.8" data-end="223.16">all please keep building really awesome</span> <span data-start="223.16" data-end="226.19">stuff but none of it works specifically</span> <span data-start="226.19" data-end="230.57">for what we wanted to build so it was</span> <span data-start="230.57" data-end="235.97">either we we came to this impasse we</span> <span data-start="235.97" data-end="237.29">could either invest in one of these</span> <span data-start="237.29" data-end="238.94">technologies that wouldn't do exactly</span> <span data-start="238.94" data-end="240.98">what we wanted or just give up on</span> <span data-start="240.98" data-end="243.769">everything but I realized that there</span> <span data-start="243.769" data-end="245.959">were just a few specific goals that we</span> <span data-start="245.959" data-end="249.11">needed to achieve in order to that we</span> <span data-start="249.11" data-end="251.63">really wanted to solve first of all</span> <span data-start="251.63" data-end="254.81">everything should be really fast really</span> <span data-start="254.81" data-end="257.69">fast start up the runtime and everything</span> <span data-start="257.69" data-end="260.51">in your app should be fast and that</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="263.48">means that a lot of work needs to be</span> <span data-start="263.48" data-end="265.85">done to make sure that there's no long</span> <span data-start="265.85" data-end="268.34">running code or big loops that are you</span> <span data-start="268.34" data-end="270.38">know causing a lot of things to change</span> <span data-start="270.38" data-end="273.38">within the app and it also means that</span> <span data-start="273.38" data-end="275.479">development should be fast as a</span> <span data-start="275.479" data-end="278.69">developer as an implementer of code you</span> <span data-start="278.69" data-end="279.62">don't want to spend a lot of time</span> <span data-start="279.62" data-end="281.63">messing with the library or with the</span> <span data-start="281.63" data-end="284.57">framework and you just want to develop</span> <span data-start="284.57" data-end="287.72">your

<p><span data-start="324.71" data-end="326.449">JavaScript and rails is definitely not</span> <span data-start="326.449" data-end="328.699">the end-all of web frameworks but for</span> <span

path of least resistance so spoiler</span> <span data-start="342.8" data-end="345.949">alert that's going to pop up a lot it</span> <span data-start="345.949" data-end="348.94">should also maximize designer happiness</span> <span data-start="348.94" data-end="351.08">things look different in the eyes of</span> <span data-start="351.08" data-end="354.11">designers and they're used to their

data-end="404.199">figure out everything that's happening</span> <span data-start="404.199" data-end="406.159">it should follow convention over</span> <span data-start="406.159"

to flip so we</span> <span data-start="418.03" data-end="420.56">didn't want to do that with when you</span> <span data-start="420.56" data-end="422.84">follow well established conventions you</span> <span data-start="422.84" data-end="424.699">write less code you know where to put</span> <span data-start="424.699" data-end="426.44">your stuff which is a big problem with</span> <span

data-end="431.96">where do you put all your controllers</span> <span data-start="431.96" data-end="433.4">where do you put all your models</span> <span data-start="433.4" data-end="435.949">in the same file if your app is big then</span> <span data-start="435.949" data-end="437.33">do you put them in different folders</span> <span data-start="437.33" data-end="439.79">which folders so we wanted a place to</span> <span data-start="439.79" data-end="442.699">put your stuff and again when there's</span> <span data-start="442.699" data-end="444.32">well established conventions you can sit</span> <span data-start="444.32" data-end="446.03">down look at something and not have to</span> <span data-start="446.03" data-end="447.83">figure out how it works because it works</span> <span data-start="447.83" data-end="450.979">the same in every single application we</span> <span data-start="450.979" data-end="452.9">also wanted a really powerful system of</span> <span data-start="452.9" data-end="455.06">bindings so part of the problem with</span> <span data-start="455.06" data-end="457.13">building large apps is keeping them in</span> <span data-start="457.13" data-end="460.85">sync you when data changes in one part</span> <span data-start="460.85" data-end="462.199">of your app you usually want to know</span> <span data-start="462.199" data-end="464.09">about it somewhere else you either end</span> <span data-start="464.09" data-end="468.43">up writing a lot of code yourself or if</span> <span data-start="468.43" data-end="471.53">if your framework has implemented a</span> <span data-start="471.53" data-end="473.24">system of bindings it's usually just</span> <span data-start="473.24" data-end="475.639">kind of attacked on thing so we really</span> <span data-start="475.639" data-end="476.93">wanted to build the whole framework</span> <span data-start="476.93" data-end="479.979">around this powerful system of bindings</span> <span data-start="479.979" data-end="482.389">and that means that everything is really</span> <span data-start="482.389" data-end="486.68">really fast and finally there's no</span> <span data-start="486.68" data-end="489.71">templates when you have templates in</span> <span data-start="489.71" data-end="492.53">client-side code like ejs or eco or any</span> <span data-start="492.53" data-end="495.259">of these other templating languages they</span> <span data-start="495.259" data-end="499.16">were great on servers but we're not in</span> <span

data-end="505.25">whenever anything in your app changes</span> <span data-start="505.25" data-end="507.62">you have to blow all of those changes or</span> <span data-start="507.62" data-end="509.72">you have to blow all of your Dom away to</span> <span data-start="509.72" data-end="513.5">replace it with a new dalam plus they</span> <span data-start="513.5"

data-end="519.77">slow so not only do you have to replace</span> <span data-start="519.77" data-end="521.93">entire sections of your page but you</span> <span data-start="521.93" data-end="524.089">have to parse that string first and then</span> <span data-start="524.089" data-end="527.33">create nodes from it and that parsing</span> <span data-start="527.33" data-end="529.04">can take a long time like in the case of</span> <span data-start="529.04" data-end="532.61">the original mustache and they also mix</span> <span data-start="532.61" data-end="537.47">logic with design so we didn't want to</span> <span data-start="537.47" data-end="539.66">use any type of JavaScript templating</span> <span data-start="539.66"

data-end="547.7">you have a library like backbone or any</span> <span data-start="547.7" data-end="550.3">of the other JavaScript micro frameworks</span> <span data-start="550.3"

data-end="558.41">cool things happen but you're still</span> <span data-start="558.41" data-end="560.779">writing a lot of glue code and and</span> <span data-start="560.779"

be</span> <span data-start="570.83" data-end="572.3">taken care of for you so you just</span> <span data-start="572.3" data-end="576.31">concentrate on writing your actual app</span> <span data-start="576.31" data-end="579.95">so those were the goals that we had and</span> <span data-start="579.95" data-end="582.5">that brings us back to the dilemma we're</span> <span data-start="582.5" data-end="584.68">back at this impasse do we want to</span> <span data-start="584.68" data-end="588.14">invest in one of these other frameworks</span> <span data-start="588.14" data-end="591.71">or
