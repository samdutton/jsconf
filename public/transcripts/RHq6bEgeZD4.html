data-end="1206.78">first let's do the division drop again</span> <span data-start="1206.78" data-end="1210.51">here is the progress bar the pray bottom</span> <span data-start="1210.51" data-end="1214.71">that they talk the audio bottom the</span> <span data-start="1214.71" data-end="1216.72">audio controller</span> <span data-start="1216.72" data-end="1219.9">and as a whole it is

which</span> <span data-start="1230.01" data-end="1233.73">is which has not so much change we can</span> <span data-start="1233.73" data-end="1236.94">use a console abandon rack in react to</span> <span data-start="1236.94" data-end="1244.77">represent and we can and all this come</span> <span data-start="1244.77" data-end="1248.25">cause elements can compose it a praetor</span> <span data-start="1248.25" data-end="1253.44">control so we can create another</span> <span data-start="1253.44" data-end="1256.83">component to accommodate these elements</span> <span data-start="1256.83" data-end="1259.44">and write some logics about how to</span> <span data-start="1259.44" data-end="1264.9">control the video and since we know life</span> <span data-start="1264.9" data-end="1267.24">control is the subset of pray back</span> <span data-start="1267.24" data-end="1269.88">control we can just simply extends it</span> <span data-start="1269.88" data-end="1274.56">and then we we can just do some small</span> <span data-start="1274.56" data-end="1278.91">modification for example we know a live</span> <span data-start="1278.91" data-end="1280.89">controller does not contain a progress</span> <span data-start="1280.89" data-end="1285.09">bar we do not need to initiate the</span> <span data-start="1285.09" data-end="1293.91">progress bar in this component and and</span> <span data-start="1293.91" data-end="1297.93">then we use live control playback and we</span> <span data-start="1297.93" data-end="1302.39">do text to form the whole life rooms and</span> <span data-start="1302.39" data-end="1306.57">in this process we used hoc to help us</span> <span data-start="1306.57" data-end="1311.79">to finish the job so what is hoc it is</span> <span data-start="1311.79" data-end="1317.13">so for high high order component I think</span> <span data-start="1317.13" data-end="1318.54">it is quite easy to for you to</span> <span data-start="1318.54" data-end="1321.3">understand it is just like you put a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1321.3" data-end="1325.64">Picard shoe and then it returns a Rachel</span> <span data-start="1325.64" data-end="1328.98">now it it always returns a stronger one</span> <span data-start="1328.98" data-end="1335.52">and then when you when you try to create</span> <span data-start="1335.52" data-end="1337.5">a live room or private room you just put</span> <span data-start="1337.5" data-end="1342.11">the video and a controller and does it</span> <span data-start="1342.11" data-end="1344.34">so here's an example</span> <span data-start="1344.34" data-end="1346.89">it is create a the pray back and room</span> <span data-start="1346.89" data-end="1350.52">creator which is the is a an hoc</span> <span data-start="1350.52" data-end="1354.3">and then you'll pray some metrics in in</span> <span data-start="1354.3" data-end="1359.27">these components and then that's it and</span> <span data-start="1359.27" data-end="1365.13">this is the same here so in a row it is</span> <span data-start="1365.13" data-end="1368.309">just like a template you might think if</span> <span data-start="1368.309" data-end="1372.51">you use hoc correctly you you can just</span> <span data-start="1372.51" data-end="1376.44">create a different tamp raise for</span> <span data-start="1376.44" data-end="1379.32">whatever the product manager asks you to</span>

data-start="1416.91" data-end="1418.91">have a lot in common</span> <span data-start="1418.91" data-end="1424.47">simply use extend and lastly for if you</span> <span data-start="1424.47" data-end="1426.6">wanted to create different combinations</span> <span data-start="1426.6" data-end="1435.66">you can use hoc after some chitchat I I</span> <span data-start="1435.66"
