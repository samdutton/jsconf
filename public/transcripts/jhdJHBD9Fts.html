<p><span data-start="90.35" data-end="94.6">They're simple, but somehow extremely alien to us.</span> <span data-start="94.6" data-end="96.63">But there's another reason that I like them.</span> <span data-start="96.63" data-end="100.32">And it has to do with Pokemon.</span> <span data-start="100.32" data-end="104.24">And this isn't really it's kind of silly but not really.</span> <span data-start="104.24" data-end="109.979">Both polyhedra and Pokemon have data associated with them.</span> <span data-start="109.979" data-end="117.829">Polyhedra have symmetries, Pokemon have different sets and rarities.</span> <span data-start="117.829" data-end="119.97">There's like a butt load of each of them.</span> <span data-start="119.97" data-end="133.969">Of a lot of unique polyhedra in Pokemon to discover and that involve in different ways.</span> <span data-start="133.969" data-end="136.54">The Pokemon just gets bigger and stronger.</span> <span data-start="136.54" data-end="140.769">And sometimes can branch off and become two different Pokemon or more.</span> <span data-start="140.769" data-end="145.09">But with polyhedra, it's more difficult.</span> <span data-start="145.09" data-end="155.5">You can do this weird twisty thing, snubification.</span> <span data-start="155.5" data-end="162.76">And when I was a kid, I spent hours poring over websites looking at models in VR and</span> <span data-start="162.76" data-end="167.809">origami which was really fun but also made me kind of sad.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="167.809" data-end="172.499">The thing was, lots of people love and know about Pokemon, me included.</span> <span data-start="172.499" data-end="177.45">In fact, I loved Pokemon so much that the first thing I did in Europe was catch one</span> <span data-start="177.45" data-end="179.519">in Pokemon, it's a regional exclusive.</span> <span data-start="179.519" data-end="180.9">I just had to.</span> <span data-start="180.9" data-end="187.4">But not as many people know about polyhedra and that's kind of a shame and sad.</span> <span data-start="187.4" data-end="192.239">I wanted to make the best polyhedra website that ever was.</span> <span data-start="192.239" data-end="197.28">To have my quest and understand them as my cause.</span> <span data-start="197.28" data-end="201.469">Today I'm going to share my journey to becoming a polyhedra master.</span> <span data-start="201.469" data-end="203.909">But before that, before talking about code.</span> <span data-start="203.909" data-end="207.569">Let's talk about the other ways that I tried to bring my love of polyhedra to life.</span> <span data-start="207.569" data-end="209.729">I went through several attempts.</span> <span data-start="209.729" data-end="212.709">The first of which is origami.</span> <span data-start="212.709" data-end="218.329">It's cool and artsy and I thought, why not make my own?</span> <span data-start="218.329" data-end="222.95">I made one cube and I got a paper cut and didn't want to do it anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="222.95" data-end="224.849">I got tired quickly.</span> <span data-start="224.849" data-end="228.65">I thought, maybe I could 3D print them and make cool jewelry.</span> <span data-start="228.65" data-end="231.4">You know, 3D printing technology advanced a lot.</span> <span data-start="231.4" data-end="237.65">You need to upload a model and, oh, my god, it's too expensive.</span> <span data-start="237.65" data-end="241.569">The next step which followed was writing polyhedra fan fiction.</span> <span data-start="241.569" data-end="247.569">[ Laughter ] But less said about that phase, the better.</span> <span data-start="247.569" data-end="250.469">And after this I decided you know what?</span> <span data-start="250.469" data-end="251.68">Let me just make a website.</span> <span data-start="251.68" data-end="253.739">That's what I know how to do.</span> <span data-start="253.739" data-end="255.479">So, I got started.</span> <span data-start="255.479" data-end="257.709">Our journey begins in May 2015.</span> <span data-start="257.709" data-end="263.25">I was working as an internal tools engineer making code for engineers who make code for</span> <span data-start="263.25" data-end="266.439">engineers who make code for other people.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="266.439" data-end="271.5">It felt like a Pikachu in the generator just grinding away.</span> <span data-start="271.5" data-end="273.659">So, wait.</span> <span data-start="273.659" data-end="279.15">So, I asked my boss, I really wanted to do frontend and I asked him, can I work on frontend</span> <span data-start="279.15" data-end="280.15">stuff.</span> <span data-start="280.15" data-end="284.039">And eventually he got back to me and said well, you know, I heard you like this.</span> <span data-start="284.039" data-end="285.63">We have a new project coming up.</span> <span data-start="285.63" data-end="287.97">I have just the thing for you, Jenkins.</span> <span data-start="287.97" data-end="290.259">[ Laughter ] It's a UI.</span> <span data-start="290.259" data-end="292.28">You should work on that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="292.28" data-end="296.59">Needless to say, I was not very happy with this, so I decided to take matters into my</span> <span data-start="296.59" data-end="297.699">own hands.</span> <span data-start="297.699" data-end="302.27">And what better way to do that than by making something that I already love.</span> <span data-start="302.27" data-end="308.389">When I started, I had a bunch of big brain ideas about collecting every single fact about</span> <span data-start="308.389" data-end="311.88">polyhedra in Wikipedia and putting them on my page, I wanted to do VR.</span> <span data-start="311.88" data-end="316.84">I wanted to do cool transformations, transforming them into once another.</span> <span data-start="316.84" data-end="320.129">And I still had my job going Jenkins.</span> <span data-start="320.129" data-end="325.54">In Pokemon, before you challenge the elite four, you have to get your first gym badge.</span> <span data-start="325.54" data-end="327.21">That's what I did.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="327.21" data-end="333.719">I narrowed it down to an updated version of the sites that hi loved as a kid where I could</span> <span data-start="333.719" data-end="337.919">see my favorite polyhedra.</span> <span data-start="337.919" data-end="341.27">I downloaded from one of my favorite websites.</span> <span data-start="341.27" data-end="346.36">JS was a little too low level and I didn't to want struggle with lighting and buffers.</span> <span data-start="346.36" data-end="355.99">But I knew D3 and the data binding model and I found a library, xFreedom, letting me express</span> <span data-start="355.99" data-end="360.62">3D modelling data as dominoes like D3.</span> <span data-start="360.62" data-end="363.99">It worked perfectly.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="423.61" data-end="428.31">I thought that I should be a good employee and learn about it in a side project.</span> <span data-start="428.31" data-end="433.83">But I didn't want to do the basic TD app that everyone does with learning a new frontend</span> <span data-start="433.83" data-end="434.83">framework.</span> <span data-start="434.83" data-end="439.77">So, I thought, why not make my old polyhedra viewer into React.</span> <span data-start="439.77" data-end="444.97">After all, Nintendo has been making the same Pokemon game for decades and we love them.</span> <span data-start="444.97" data-end="446.33">I got started.</span> <span data-start="446.33" data-end="452.9">And it turns out that React as a framework, it works really well with X3 DOM just like</span> <span data-start="452.9" data-end="453.9">D3.</span> <span data-start="453.9" data-end="459.69">Moreover, I found that React was easier to add in reactivity such as a configuration</span> <span data-start="459.69" data-end="466.789">panel or a search bar or an index page where you can see my collection at once.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="466.789" data-end="468.9">And I don't have a live version of this running.</span> <span data-start="468.9" data-end="472.819">But I showed it to my boss and teammates and that was it.</span> <span data-start="472.819" data-end="475.24">Oh, get back to work.</span> <span data-start="475.24" data-end="478.349">It was more interactive, but still esthetic.</span> <span data-start="478.349" data-end="482.419">You can change the colors but doesn't tell you about polyhedra.</span> <span data-start="482.419" data-end="487.9">What I wanted was the cool transitions, but I didn't have time because I was busy refactoring</span> <span data-start="487.9" data-end="492.379">an Angular app, so I had to put it away again.</span> <span data-start="492.379" data-end="493.659">Fast forward another couple of months.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="493.659" data-end="499.06">And in October, left my job due to burnout and depression and kind of just wanted to</span> <span data-start="499.06" data-end="503.21">take a break from all the coding and focus on my other hobbies.</span> <span data-start="503.21" data-end="505.93">Like fan fiction.</span> <span data-start="505.93" data-end="513.469">But somehow writing polyhedra fan fiction did not make me forget about polyhedra.</span> <span data-start="513.469" data-end="518.5">And old habits die hard and I kept coming back to the polyhedra and making improvements</span> <span data-start="518.5" data-end="519.839">to it.</span> <span data-start="519.839" data-end="526.089">More specifically, I wanted to arrange the polyhedra into sort of a periodic table based</span> <span data-start="526.089" data-end="527.81">on their properties.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="527.81" data-end="533.399">And seeing all the polyhedra related to each other and correlating it like that made me</span> <span data-start="533.399" data-end="537.1">think, why not just do what I wanted to do in the first place?</span> <span data-start="537.1" data-end="541.44">I finally feel I have the skills to do it, and more importantly, I have the time.</span> <span data-start="541.44" data-end="546.11">I got started on the long, laborious process of finally making the final evolution of my</span> <span data-start="546.11" data-end="548.62">polyhedra viewer.</span> <span data-start="548.62" data-end="550.99">I have no idea what I'm doing.</span> <span data-start="550.99" data-end="557.86">But the very first step was to determine what operations were possible and actually valid.</span> <span data-start="557.86" data-end="561.66">After all, not over Pokemon can evolve or combine into one another.</span> <span data-start="561.66" data-end="567.23">And you don't want to allow free form combinations in polyhedra as cool as they might look.</span> <span data-start="567.23" data-end="571.94">I had the relations for the periodic table.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="571.94" data-end="578.49">And when you see lines connecting dots like this, you're looking at a state machine or</span> <span data-start="578.49" data-end="582.709">a graph with the polyhedra's notes and the operations at the edges.</span> <span data-start="582.709" data-end="585.94">And there's a pretty straight forward to represent this as an object.</span> <span data-start="585.94" data-end="592.63">You can it's just like an object of an object of a list of objects.</span> <span data-start="592.63" data-end="596.88">You just label it with metadata to differentiate between multiple results.</span> <span data-start="596.88" data-end="601.11">But there's a lot of polyhedra and a lot of relationships to encode.</span> <span data-start="601.11" data-end="605.04">And it's all really but luckily, it's all really structured.</span> <span data-start="605.04" data-end="611.1">And through an advanced programming technique called foreloops, we can save time from manually</span> <span data-start="611.1" data-end="612.61">coding the entire graph.</span> <span data-start="612.61" data-end="613.61">Okay.</span> <span data-start="613.61" data-end="617.32">Now that we have this graph, we can figure out what configurations and options to transfer</span> <span data-start="617.32" data-end="619.38">a polyhedra to another one.</span> <span data-start="619.38" data-end="624.32">And you can disable operations, if they're invalid.</span> <span data-start="624.32" data-end="630.839">You can test whether an operation leads to a result that matches the model that we currently</span> <span data-start="630.839" data-end="631.839">have.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="631.839" data-end="636.54">You can mock the applications and click the next polyhedron instead of animating them.</span> <span data-start="636.54" data-end="640.19">Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the transitions.</span> <span data-start="640.19" data-end="646.73">At the beginning, I didn't know what I was doing and how many operations or what I wanted.</span> <span data-start="646.73" data-end="652.09">So, it would be nice to have an abstract interface that I can plug in.</span> <span data-start="652.09" data-end="656.35">Hi to think to myself, what is a transition?</span> <span data-start="656.35" data-end="659.17">Think about what we're doing.</span> <span data-start="659.17" data-end="667.55">We're interpolating verities from a start to an end.</span> <span data-start="667.55" data-end="672.54">The faces and edges are defined by the Vertices.</span> <span data-start="672.54" data-end="677.01">They don't change even if they're invisible at some point or overlap.</span> <span data-start="677.01" data-end="680.889">But there's a problem with doing duplication.</span> <span data-start="680.889" data-end="684.17">And that's that we want to be able to chain operations like this.</span> <span data-start="684.17" data-end="687.73">We want to be able to blow stuff up and contract stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="687.73" data-end="692.889">And it would be too complicated to keep track of all the due my cushions for every operation.</span> <span data-start="692.889" data-end="704.029">And we have the switch, and it's hard to see which is which, it's impossible to tell the</span> <span data-start="704.029" data-end="707.64">duplicate, but one has extra vertices and faces.</span> <span data-start="707.64" data-end="710.48">And we can define an interface.</span> <span data-start="710.48" data-end="716.339">And as long as the functions return the interface, we can animate all of them the same way.</span> <span data-start="716.339" data-end="724.839">And the algorithm is one, replace the vertices with the duplicated versions, and interpolate</span> <span data-start="724.839" data-end="729.4">and switch out the end result with the D duplicated version.</span> <span data-start="729.4" data-end="731.829">This is kind of what it looks like in code.</span> <span data-start="731.829" data-end="737.921">We have the state function, set it to the start and interpolate and set it to the D</span> <span data-start="737.921" data-end="740.079">duplicated end.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="740.079" data-end="742.96">And finally, you need an interpolation function.</span> <span data-start="742.96" data-end="746.769">There's a lot of libraries you can use for animation in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="746.769" data-end="751.329">Half don't exist anymore because animation in JavaScript is a crap shoot.</span> <span data-start="751.329" data-end="756.41">Or you can Google and roll out your own.</span> <span data-start="756.41" data-end="757.73">It's great.</span> <span data-start="757.73" data-end="761.19">We don't have anything to test it on, though.</span> <span data-start="761.19" data-end="765.529">So, let's talk about the actual operations we're going to make.</span> <span data-start="765.529" data-end="767.11">I'm not going to go over all of them.</span> <span data-start="767.11" data-end="772.23">But I wanted to share one example that's kind of easy and it's this operation called rectify.</span> <span data-start="772.23" data-end="774.019">You have this shape, a cuboctahedron.</span> <span data-start="774.019" data-end="783.329">And you have the cube and draw the points and draw lines and cut them up and slice them</span> <span data-start="783.329" data-end="784.329">up.</span> <span data-start="784.329" data-end="788.649">But we don't want to go back and forth, we want a smooth transition.</span> <span data-start="788.649" data-end="796.22">In order to get the smooth transition, to animate it, we duplicate each twice so there</span> <span data-start="796.22" data-end="798.92">are three vertices at each corner.</span> <span data-start="798.92" data-end="804.829">Pull them to the midpoints and if there are two sets of vertices, we consolidate them</span> <span data-start="804.829" data-end="806.279">into one.</span> </p>
