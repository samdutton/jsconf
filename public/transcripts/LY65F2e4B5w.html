data-end="560.45">works is it uses the luminance levels</span> <span data-start="560.45" data-end="563.24">that light level of the pixels in each</span> <span data-start="563.24"

<span data-start="624.89" data-end="627.05">a dog skateboarding who's the winner</span> <span data-start="627.05" data-end="631.13">here so screen blend mode is the</span> <span data-start="631.13"

data-end="637.31">mentioned earlier it's doing 1 minus</span> <span data-start="637.31" data-end="639.38">that luminosity value and then it's</span> <span data-start="639.38"
