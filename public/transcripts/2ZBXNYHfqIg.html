data-start="91.66" data-end="94.24">data visualization so Elise and I are</span> <span data-start="94.24" data-end="96.34">extremely passionate about open source</span> <span data-start="96.34"

data-end="115.63">involved in humanitarian free and open</span> <span data-start="115.63" data-end="117.369">source projects and at least had a</span> <span data-start="117.369" data-end="119.77">spur-of-the-moment idea to challenge the</span> <span data-start="119.77" data-end="121.509">women at Grace Hopper to attend the next</span> <span data-start="121.509"

data-end="133.18">that respond to challenges facing</span> <span data-start="133.18" data-end="135.94">humanity today and twice a year the are</span> <span data-start="135.94" data-end="137.5">hot core team where both of our</span> <span data-start="137.5" data-end="139.66">companies are founding partners hold</span> <span data-start="139.66" data-end="141.88">hack events around the world and it just</span> <span data-start="141.88" data-end="143.319">so happened that there was an R hoc</span> <span data-start="143.319" data-end="145.51">event happening in December about two</span> <span data-start="145.51" data-end="148.69">months after Grace Hopper and another</span> <span data-start="148.69" data-end="151.15">issue was like at previous our Hawk</span> <span data-start="151.15" data-end="153.099">events there were only about two or</span> <span data-start="153.099" data-end="154.78">three women attending at each location</span> <span data-start="154.78" data-end="157.66">so usually the number of women in a</span> <span data-start="157.66" data-end="159.58">technical community or work environment</span> <span data-start="159.58" data-end="162.909">is very few right and the number has</span> <span data-start="162.909" data-end="165.72">actually been declining over the last 20</span> <span data-start="165.72" data-end="168.39">years so we decided we would set the</span> <span data-start="168.39" data-end="170.01">challenge to an ambitious twenty percent</span> <span data-start="170.01" data-end="172.44">we would aim to get the goal of having</span> <span data-start="172.44" data-end="174.9">twenty percent of the participants be</span> <span data-start="174.9" data-end="177.24">female at each of the 21 locations</span> <span data-start="177.24" data-end="179.46">around the world and we announced the</span> <span data-start="179.46" data-end="181.23">challenge at Grace Hopper and promoted</span> <span data-start="181.23" data-end="183.54">it via Facebook Twitter Linkedin the</span> <span data-start="183.54" data-end="186.36">usual methods and also a scholarship for</span> <span data-start="186.36" data-end="189.33">one female participant and after the</span> <span data-start="189.33" data-end="191.7">event we wanted to see well how many of</span> <span data-start="191.7" data-end="193.29">the locations actually reach twenty</span> <span data-start="193.29" data-end="196.26">percent so in several locations we were</span> <span data-start="196.26" data-end="198.3">quite successful for example the Chicago</span> <span data-start="198.3" data-end="199.86">location where we hit thirty one percent</span> <span data-start="199.86" data-end="202.32">the winning the winning hack was</span> <span data-start="202.32" data-end="203.76">actually comprised for a four-fifths</span> <span data-start="203.76" data-end="207.6">female which was pretty awesome so we</span> <span data-start="207.6" data-end="209.31">also wanted to represent this data we</span> <span data-start="209.31" data-end="210.99">collected in an easy to comprehend</span> <span data-start="210.99" data-end="214.23">manner the data from our Hawk the are</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="214.23" data-end="216.12">Hawk event made it very clear that we're</span> <span data-start="216.12" data-end="218.76">really far from getting to 5050 in terms</span> <span data-start="218.76" data-end="221.37">of gender ratio so we wanted to present</span> <span data-start="221.37" data-end="222.99">this data so people actually feel</span> <span data-start="222.99" data-end="225.03">shocked when they see it and our perhaps</span> <span data-start="225.03" data-end="227.61">compelled to raise awareness and take</span> <span data-start="227.61" data-end="229.95">action regarding the gender disparity in</span> <span data-start="229.95" data-end="231.72">open source and in computer science in</span> <span data-start="231.72" data-end="235.2">general so data visualization is not</span> <span data-start="235.2" data-end="236.82">something either at least or I are</span> <span data-start="236.82" data-end="240.63">experts at or do every day and we have</span> <span data-start="240.63" data-end="242.67">like due to our day jobs we have like a</span> <span data-start="242.67" data-end="245.67">limited amount of time to explore but we</span> <span data-start="245.67" data-end="247.11">wanted to see what we could do with the</span> <span data-start="247.11" data-end="249.33">the data we had and we talked to</span> <span data-start="249.33" data-end="250.769">colleagues and found out that this is</span> <span data-start="250.769" data-end="252.42">actually an interesting problem right a</span> <span data-start="252.42" data-end="254.04">lot of Engineers even front-end</span> <span data-start="254.04" data-end="256.29">engineers don't think data visualization</span> <span data-start="256.29" data-end="258.18">is easy and we wanted to see if this was</span> <span data-start="258.18" data-end="260.34">true so we gave ourselves a challenge to</span> <span data-start="260.34" data-end="262.56">explore data visualization techniques</span> <span data-start="262.56" data-end="269.14">and the idea of the talk began to form</span> <span data-start="269.15" data-end="271.53">so I want to first show you the raw data</span> <span data-start="271.53" data-end="276.78">we had so um so as I mentioned the the</span> <span data-start="276.78" data-end="277.95">challenge that we put out was a</span> <span data-start="277.95" data-end="280.41">spur-of-the-moment idea and we didn't</span> <span data-start="280.41" data-end="282.21">have a data collection process in place</span> <span data-start="282.21" data-end="283.83">when we made the challenge we kind of</span> <span data-start="283.83" data-end="285.66">just did it so we had like an online</span> <span data-start="285.66" data-end="288.03">event registration system but each of</span> <span data-start="288.03" data-end="290.04">the locations people just wrote down</span> <span data-start="290.04" data-end="291.57">their names when they came in so we</span> <span data-start="291.57" data-end="293.52">didn't have an online record of who came</span> <span data-start="293.52" data-end="295.44">to see who came to each hack or the</span> <span data-start="295.44" data-end="297.57">gender of the people who attended so</span> <span data-start="297.57" data-end="299.4">this is a snapshot of the original data</span> <span data-start="299.4" data-end="301.31">and we have one row per participant and</span> <span data-start="301.31" data-end="303.93">but we yeah we didn't have their gender</span> <span data-start="303.93" data-end="305.75">so our lease and I went through like</span> <span data-start="305.75" data-end="309.05">1500 rose and manually entered in the</span> <span data-start="309.05" data-end="310.949">gender for each location and we</span> <span data-start="310.949" data-end="313.32">contacted colleagues around the world</span> <span data-start="313.32" data-end="315.15">like asking like is this mailer is this</span> <span data-start="315.15" data-end="317.22">female and we removed like as we learned</span> <span data-start="317.22" data-end="319.979">today there are names like Jan which are</span> <span data-start="319.979" data-end="322.229">both male and female so we had to remove</span> <span data-start="322.229" data-end="326.28">that data so we still ended up with over</span> <span data-start="326.28" data-end="328.65">1300 name valid names though with gender</span> <span data-start="328.65" data-end="330.36">so we thought that's a good set of data</span> <span data-start="330.36" data-end="332.94">and now that we had all this data though</span> <span data-start="332.94" data-end="334.199">we wanted to figure out a way to present</span> <span data-start="334.199" data-end="336.11">it in a manner where that is easily</span> <span data-start="336.11" data-end="338.82">digestible by the public and by the our</span> <span data-start="338.82" data-end="344.91">hot core team so we first aggregated the</span> <span data-start="344.91" data-end="346.919">data so we could see how each location</span> <span data-start="346.919" data-end="349.38">fared using spreadsheet formulas to help</span> <span data-start="349.38" data-end="351.96">us and we then wanted to start looking</span> <span data-start="351.96" data-end="354.36">at okay different tools to help us</span> <span data-start="354.36" data-end="357.12">visualize the data and we decided on the</span> <span data-start="357.12" data-end="359.28">following process we would start with a</span> <span data-start="359.28" data-end="361.62">set of tools to evaluate we would take</span> <span data-start="361.62" data-end="364.199">10 minutes to see if the tools of viable</span> <span data-start="364.199" data-end="365.849">option and if we found the tool to be</span> <span data-start="365.849" data-end="367.83">viable we would explore the tool further</span> <span data-start="367.83" data-end="369.75">to reach our desired goals with our</span> <span data-start="369.75" data-end="372.36">goals being one to plot the number of</span> <span data-start="372.36" data-end="374.909">people at each location to to plot the</span> <span data-start="374.909" data-end="376.919">percentage of women at each location and</span> <span data-start="376.919" data-end="378.78">three be able to plot both one and two</span> <span data-start="378.78" data-end="382.8">on the same chart from four clearly show</span> <span data-start="382.8" data-end="386.52">the gender disparity and five be able to</span> <span data-start="386.52" data-end="388.199">use this tool to easily visualize data</span> <span data-start="388.199" data-end="389.909">for future are Hawks because we want to</span> <span data-start="389.909" data-end="391.47">continue the challenge and hopefully</span> <span data-start="391.47" data-end="393.599">slowly increase the goal percentage as</span> <span data-start="393.599" data-end="395.94">more and more women at 10 and we also</span> <span data-start="395.94" data-end="399.65">decided that we would take like one hour</span> <span data-start="399.65" data-end="402.389">with each tool so if we could reach this</span> <span data-start="402.389" data-end="405.659">metric of success so the first tool we</span> <span data-start="405.659" data-end="408.599">started with was open heat map so open</span> <span data-start="408.599" data-end="410.699">heat map is it's an open source project</span> <span data-start="410.699" data-end="413.099">implemented by Pete worden ER and it</span> <span data-start="413.099" data-end="415.169">uses the OpenStreetMap tiles to draw the</span> <span data-start="415.169" data-end="417.659">maps and the service is designed to make</span> <span data-start="417.659" data-end="419.61">it easy for non-specialists to create</span> <span data-start="419.61" data-end="421.62">maps for communicating information and</span> <span data-start="421.62" data-end="423.169">we're like oh wow that's us right</span> <span data-start="423.169" data-end="425.159">non-specialist this could be a dream</span> <span data-start="425.159" data-end="428.13">tool so for developers there's a jquery</span> <span data-start="428.13" data-end="429.87">plugin that makes it easy to create an</span> <span data-start="429.87" data-end="432.21">open source mapping component on any web</span> <span data-start="432.21" data-end="432.87">page</span> <span data-start="432.87" data-end="434.67">so I want to show you a quick demo of us</span> <span data-start="434.67" data-end="435.99">actually using the tool with our</span> <span data-start="435.99" data-end="437.58">aggregated data so you can see how easy</span> <span data-start="437.58" data-end="452.42">it is to use</span> <span data-start="452.43" data-end="462.35">so I love my mouth where'd it go</span> <span data-start="462.36" data-end="467.8">mmm do you guys see it completely lost</span> <span data-start="467.8" data-end="476.65">it okay try again huh okay all right</span> <span data-start="476.65" data-end="483.4">here it is yay thanks so um let me make</span> <span data-start="483.4" data-end="485.5">it larger so you can easily come here</span> <span data-start="485.5" data-end="488.98">and you can upload a CSV so we uploaded</span> <span data-start="488.98" data-end="493.51">our abrogated data set and then</span> <span data-start="493.51" data-end="495.76">basically if it thinks the data is valid</span> <span data-start="495.76" data-end="497.89">what it will do is basically say okay</span> <span data-start="497.89" data-end="499.75">your data is loaded click here to view</span> <span data-start="499.75" data-end="503.89">the map so then you can view your map</span> <span data-start="503.89" data-end="508.63">right away and right away it gave us a</span> <span data-start="508.63" data-end="513.1">heat map of the data that that we had I</span> <span data-start="513.1" data-end="515.89">can hover over the markers to see any</span> <span data-start="515.89" data-end="518.11">specific data points so I can see the</span> <span data-start="518.11" data-end="519.82">percentage of women at each location on</span> <span data-start="519.82" data-end="522.52">the the large blue circle is Colombia</span> <span data-start="522.52" data-end="524.17">there and it's actually a really big</span> <span data-start="524.17" data-end="525.76">anomaly and we removed it from later</span> <span data-start="525.76" data-end="528.97">examples we did because Colombia was a</span> <span data-start="528.97" data-end="530.65">satellite location and it happened to</span> <span data-start="530.65" data-end="533.02">have it had one person there I know it</span> <span data-start="533.02" data-end="534.4">was a female so that's why it looks so</span> <span data-start="534.4" data-end="538.72">big but you can come in here you can</span> <span data-start="538.72" data-end="539.95">customize at the bottom you can</span> <span data-start="539.95" data-end="541.84">customize certain parameters you can</span> <span data-start="541.84" data-end="545.29">customize the title the color it has a</span> <span data-start="545.29" data-end="549.28">few color schemes the size of the</span> <span data-start="549.28" data-end="554.77">circles and you can also show other you</span> <span data-start="554.77" data-end="556.09">don't have to use circles you can use</span> <span data-start="556.09" data-end="559.78">blobs and some standard images so then</span> <span data-start="559.78" data-end="562.12">when you get your finalize what you want</span> <span data-start="562.12" data-end="570.7">you can save in view and while I you got</span> <span data-start="570.7" data-end="572.14">your map with the parameters that you</span> <span data-start="572.14" data-end="575.23">set this is nice big this part is nice</span> <span data-start="575.23" data-end="576.97">because it actually shows a nice legend</span> <span data-start="576.97" data-end="579.85">based on the data you have and we</span> <span data-start="579.85" data-end="581.59">actually learned a lot of tools don't</span> <span data-start="581.59" data-end="583.12">even the programmatic ones don't come</span>
