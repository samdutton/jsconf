<p><span data-start="423.68" data-end="433.569">Quadratic Bezier covers are more complicated than they sound, here we are just curving</span> <span data-start="433.569" data-end="439.05">between the mid-point of the last slide to the next point in our drawing, ending up creating</span> <span data-start="439.05" data-end="442.77">a nice smooth curve.</span> <span data-start="442.77" data-end="446.81">Here are some more horses that actual people have drawn using HorseDrawingTycoon.</span> <span data-start="446.81" data-end="450.29">Ok, so we're done with canvass for now.</span> <span data-start="450.29" data-end="456.849">That's takes us to chapter 3, LucidJS, at the VanJS presentation I just attended a talk</span> <span data-start="456.849" data-end="462.58">on Twitter's flight, a component shading event driven framework, it was interesting in the</span> <span data-start="462.58" data-end="466.479">point of being my application as a collection of components that send and receive events</span> <span data-start="466.479" data-end="473.509">appealed to me, flight itself wasn't the right framework for me, months earlier I attended</span> <span data-start="473.509" data-end="479.27">a talk on LucidJS, pretty much the same thing, but I was paying more attention during the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="479.27" data-end="486.199">LucidJS, JavaScript has the own baked in events, but we need to maintain separation between</span> <span data-start="486.199" data-end="491.05">elements like click and things like clear canvass.</span> <span data-start="491.05" data-end="498.05">Let's look at a simple LucidJS event emitter, we can create an emitter to manage events,</span> <span data-start="498.05" data-end="504.509">then we can combined function to an event, we're binding it to the super awesome event,</span> <span data-start="504.509" data-end="508.099">then we can call the function by emitting the function 0 come event, passing any events</span> <span data-start="508.099" data-end="511.13">to the function.</span> <span data-start="511.13" data-end="516.72">LucidJS that has a lot of functions above and beyond a standard event emitter, you can</span> <span data-start="516.72" data-end="523.419">bind specific events to one another, name space events so that only specific listeners</span> <span data-start="523.419" data-end="528.03">will receive those events and even create meta listeners and listen on the very act</span> <span data-start="528.03" data-end="530.94">of binding itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.94" data-end="534.22">HorseDrawingTycoon comfortably ignores all of these features but they are all potentially</span> <span data-start="534.22" data-end="538.1">useful for larger applications.</span> <span data-start="538.1" data-end="542.26">So how is those better than defining global functions and then calling them?</span> <span data-start="542.26" data-end="552.01">Well more than one function can be bound against an event, the canvass function can behind</span> <span data-start="552.01" data-end="557.14">it to the current brush stroke, at the same time the component that manages the cursor</span> <span data-start="557.14" data-end="560.63">could also behind to that event and change the colour of the cursor when it receives</span> <span data-start="560.63" data-end="562.69">the change colour event.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="562.69" data-end="567.86">Both components are responding separately to the change colour event and neither of</span> <span data-start="567.86" data-end="573.37">the components needs to know about the other or what the component is doing with the event.</span> <span data-start="573.37" data-end="577.44">The other benefit of the vent stream this events become a stream of objects you can</span> <span data-start="577.44" data-end="582.57">manage, it's possible to see realise all events and store them for later, keeping a complete</span> <span data-start="582.57" data-end="588.921">history of very event in your application, or a component that listens for events that</span> <span data-start="588.921" data-end="596.62">change the application state and keep track of it using local storage, that same component</span> <span data-start="596.62" data-end="600.48">could reemit the events when the application boots up.</span> </p>
