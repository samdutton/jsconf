<p><span data-start="19" data-end="23.09">gosh James talk was so funny it's like</span> <span data-start="23.09" data-end="25.46">following up Adele and the crew could</span> <span data-start="25.46" data-end="28.43">borrow something all right um so thanks</span> <span data-start="28.43" data-end="29.9">for your interest and i'll be talking</span> <span data-start="29.9" data-end="32.239">about neural networks today how they</span> <span data-start="32.239" data-end="33.86">work how you can implement in your</span> <span data-start="33.86" data-end="36.8">network yourself and hopefully also how</span> <span data-start="36.8" data-end="40.28">you can improve your algorithm so this</span> <span data-start="40.28" data-end="42.62">is me you can follow me on twitter and</span> <span data-start="42.62" data-end="45.5">github on google+ although i'm like</span> <span data-start="45.5" data-end="47.84">rarely on there but it's always nice if</span> <span data-start="47.84" data-end="51.05">someone still on google+ so yeah i'm a</span> <span data-start="51.05" data-end="52.88">web developer by day and I basically</span> <span data-start="52.88" data-end="56.329">turned machine learning enthusiast after</span> <span data-start="56.329" data-end="59.47">i attended the AI course by and room</span> <span data-start="59.47" data-end="61.489">that was the one that actually started</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="61.489" data-end="65">Kucera and afterwards i wanted to like</span> <span data-start="65" data-end="67.31">use my new skills for a hands-on project</span> <span data-start="67.31" data-end="70.07">and at this time I was in a betting pool</span> <span data-start="70.07" data-end="73.31">in the office for the football league in</span> <span data-start="73.31" data-end="75.74">Germany and like every week you have to</span> <span data-start="75.74" data-end="78.29">come up with new predictions and usually</span> <span data-start="78.29" data-end="79.67">if you're interested in football you</span> <span data-start="79.67" data-end="81.799">don't you're not very objective about</span> <span data-start="81.799" data-end="85.1">like teams and so it's you're not using</span> <span data-start="85.1" data-end="87.62">the scientific method basically so what</span> <span data-start="87.62" data-end="89.15">I was thinking was that would be a</span> <span data-start="89.15" data-end="92.33">perfect use case to implement something</span> <span data-start="92.33" data-end="95.53">like a soccer match tendency predictor I</span> <span data-start="95.53" data-end="98.54">will show you what i was thinking and</span> <span data-start="98.54" data-end="101.9">what I meant by that so um let's start</span> <span data-start="101.9" data-end="104.57">with a funny quote and this one's by</span> <span data-start="104.57" data-end="106.729">paul gascoigne and he's also known as</span> <span data-start="106.729" data-end="108.95">gaza he's a famous English football</span> <span data-start="108.95" data-end="112.49">player and he famously said that I never</span> <span data-start="112.49" data-end="115.31">predict anything and I never will so</span> <span data-start="115.31" data-end="119.27">following his lead i will also predict</span> <span data-start="119.27" data-end="121.159">something i will predict the tendencies</span> <span data-start="121.159" data-end="122.75">of the mattress for the Premier League</span> <span data-start="122.75" data-end="125.81">this weekend I think they will start at</span> <span data-start="125.81" data-end="129.2">like 9pm and then you can just check for</span> <span data-start="129.2" data-end="130.519">yourself how well the algorithm actually</span> <span data-start="130.519" data-end="133.04">performs and whether you want to bet</span> <span data-start="133.04" data-end="134.42">money on it</span> <span data-start="134.42" data-end="137.97">so um first of all we have to ask</span> <span data-start="137.97" data-end="140.37">yourself like what is machine learning</span> <span data-start="140.37" data-end="142.79">like why would we use machine learning</span> <span data-start="142.79" data-end="146.28">so like consider we were like the</span> <span data-start="146.28" data-end="150.3">programmers of an AI in like an RPG game</span> <span data-start="150.3" data-end="153.45">and this blue sword would represent a</span> <span data-start="153.45" data-end="155.94">player's action so the player would</span> <span data-start="155.94" data-end="158.52">attack us and then we will maybe react</span> <span data-start="158.52" data-end="160.29">with the defense action with a blocking</span> <span data-start="160.29" data-end="163.32">action so you could have some kind of</span> <span data-start="163.32" data-end="165.39">behavior tree where based on your leg</span> <span data-start="165.39" data-end="168.03">remaining health points you would also</span> <span data-start="168.03" data-end="169.77">have the option to launch a</span> <span data-start="169.77" data-end="172.14">counter-attack or maybe you want to</span> <span data-start="172.14" data-end="175.14">drink a potion so the problem is and</span> <span data-start="175.14" data-end="176.97">when you have to cite the appropriate</span> <span data-start="176.97" data-end="179.79">actions and that's you will decided when</span> <span data-start="179.79" data-end="182.43">you program this tree so the the inputs</span> <span data-start="182.43" data-end="184.68">and the weights so how important is the</span> <span data-start="184.68" data-end="186.209">health in proportion through the play</span> <span data-start="186.209" data-end="189.27">action for example its deterministic</span> <span data-start="189.27" data-end="191.39">because you decide on it beforehand and</span> <span data-start="191.39" data-end="193.709">this also means that the decision making</span> <span data-start="193.709" data-end="196.38">process is very subjective because it's</span> <span data-start="196.38" data-end="197.94">implemented by a program or a game</span> <span data-start="197.94" data-end="201.269">designer and the machine cannot adapt to</span> <span data-start="201.269" data-end="203.34">individual players does it doesn't it</span> <span data-start="203.34" data-end="207.18">doesn't learn and let's say if we wanted</span> <span data-start="207.18" data-end="209.1">to implement this in a deterministic way</span> <span data-start="209.1" data-end="212.22">might look something like this so if the</span> <span data-start="212.22" data-end="214.59">player attacks we look at our health bar</span> <span data-start="214.59" data-end="217.95">and then we say at the health bar like</span> <span data-start="217.95" data-end="220.53">above 75 percent then we do a</span> <span data-start="220.53" data-end="222.87">counter-attack if it's between 25 and</span> <span data-start="222.87" data-end="225.12">seventy-five percent we do a defense</span> <span data-start="225.12" data-end="227.43">action and we have less than twenty-five</span> <span data-start="227.43" data-end="229.05">percent of our house left and we will</span> <span data-start="229.05" data-end="232.35">drink or health potion so these</span> <span data-start="232.35" data-end="236.19">thresholds they have to be chosen</span> <span data-start="236.19" data-end="238.31">beforehand and they might seem arbitrary</span> <span data-start="238.31" data-end="241.35">or like it's like a personal feeling</span> <span data-start="241.35" data-end="243.78">that what makes sense but in complex</span> <span data-start="243.78" data-end="245.94">games and it might not be possible to</span> <span data-start="245.94" data-end="247.68">manually implement all the possibilities</span> <span data-start="247.68" data-end="249.9">and all the things you want to look at</span> <span data-start="249.9" data-end="253.91">so we would not want to have this like</span> <span data-start="253.91" data-end="256.83">the sturdy monistic logic instead we</span> <span data-start="256.83" data-end="258.66">want to have something that will change</span> <span data-start="258.66" data-end="261.06">or logic depending on something else</span> <span data-start="261.06" data-end="263.669">maybe so this entire thing should be</span> <span data-start="263.669" data-end="265.92">very dynamic</span> <span data-start="265.92" data-end="269.55">so um the way that you can do this is</span> <span data-start="269.55" data-end="272.07">with calculus and I'm trying to not go</span> <span data-start="272.07" data-end="274.02">too deep into math because I'm like</span> <span data-start="274.02" data-end="276.12">don't have the time for it but let's</span> <span data-start="276.12" data-end="278.49">just take the scenario that we have the</span> <span data-start="278.49" data-end="281.79">what the user did input and then we add</span> <span data-start="281.79" data-end="285.09">the how healthy we are input and then we</span> <span data-start="285.09" data-end="288.03">will get something that pertains to the</span> <span data-start="288.03" data-end="291.45">three possible outputs of course like</span> <span data-start="291.45" data-end="293.37">the two inputs are not equally important</span> <span data-start="293.37" data-end="295.68">for decision-making so what we need here</span> <span data-start="295.68" data-end="299.22">is some weights and in this case I just</span> <span data-start="299.22" data-end="301.47">called them a and B and basically those</span> <span data-start="301.47" data-end="303.51">weights determine how important those</span> <span data-start="303.51" data-end="305.84">inputs are in relation to each other and</span> <span data-start="305.84" data-end="308.76">then in the end we don't want to</span> <span data-start="308.76" data-end="310.86">directly have like the action that we</span> <span data-start="310.86" data-end="312.48">want to take instead we want to have</span> <span data-start="312.48" data-end="315.18">like a probability distribution this</span> <span data-start="315.18" data-end="317.31">could for example just be like what's</span> <span data-start="317.31" data-end="319.29">the most probable action that a human</span> <span data-start="319.29" data-end="322.77">player would take for example and this</span> <span data-start="322.77" data-end="324.69">way it's called classification because</span> <span data-start="324.69" data-end="329.61">we try to classify the correct output</span> <span data-start="329.61" data-end="333.21">for the given inputs and once we have</span> <span data-start="333.21" data-end="335.52">the correct weights like if we can</span> <span data-start="335.52" data-end="337.35">calculate the best a and the best be</span> <span data-start="337.35" data-end="340.38">then we have a model that represents the</span> <span data-start="340.38" data-end="341.97">logic or the pattern that we want to</span> <span data-start="341.97" data-end="345">make predictions on and the thing about</span> <span data-start="345" data-end="348.3">models is like Georgie keybox said that</span> <span data-start="348.3" data-end="350.82">all models are wrong but some are useful</span> <span data-start="350.82" data-end="353.19">and what he means by that is basically</span> <span data-start="353.19" data-end="356.31">that our model will not give us the</span> <span data-start="356.31" data-end="359.07">perfect or the correct result but they</span> <span data-start="359.07" data-end="360.51">will give us one that is the best</span> <span data-start="360.51" data-end="364.02">approximation to reality basically or to</span> <span data-start="364.02" data-end="366.74">the data that we already collected and</span> <span data-start="366.74" data-end="370.5">so this is basically the magic inside a</span> <span data-start="370.5" data-end="372.9">node but it's not called neural node</span> <span data-start="372.9" data-end="375.57">it's called neural networks so we have</span> <span data-start="375.57" data-end="377.25">to like understand what neural networks</span> <span data-start="377.25" data-end="381.24">are and so the important question to</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="383.49">answer is how does anything learn and</span> <span data-start="383.49" data-end="385.95">some type of people and took a look at</span> <span data-start="385.95" data-end="387.75">it like how learning is done in nature</span> <span data-start="387.75" data-end="391.26">and as you already know probably it's</span> <span data-start="391.26" data-end="393.24">done by neurons and this would be one</span> <span data-start="393.24" data-end="394.37">neuron</span> <span data-start="394.37" data-end="396.62">neuron receives input through its</span> <span data-start="396.62" data-end="398.419">dendrites that's a fuzzy purple</span> <span data-start="398.419" data-end="401.21">attentively stuff and then there it has</span> <span data-start="401.21" data-end="403.46">the soma which is the middle part with</span> <span data-start="403.46" data-end="405.71">the green coordinate and inside the soma</span> <span data-start="405.71" data-end="408.62">there's magic happening and the input</span> <span data-start="408.62" data-end="410.36">gets changed in a deterministic way</span> <span data-start="410.36" data-end="413.27">inside the soma and then the result of</span> <span data-start="413.27" data-end="416.36">it is sent through the axon terminals</span> <span data-start="416.36" data-end="419.99">and in nature of course a decision in</span> <span data-start="419.99" data-end="421.699">your brain is not made by one single</span> <span data-start="421.699" data-end="423.889">neuron but by a vast network of neurons</span> <span data-start="423.889" data-end="426.5">so we can have multiple layers of</span> <span data-start="426.5" data-end="429.289">neurons in this case for example we have</span> <span data-start="429.289" data-end="432.59">two layers with two and three neurons so</span> <span data-start="432.59" data-end="434.63">in all output from the previous layer</span> <span data-start="434.63" data-end="437.06">will be sent to all nodes in the next</span> <span data-start="437.06" data-end="440.18">layer so in the end every node will</span> <span data-start="440.18" data-end="443.35">output a value pertaining to one singer</span> <span data-start="443.35" data-end="446.15">like one single possibility that you can</span> <span data-start="446.15" data-end="450.139">take and the thing to take away from the</span> <span data-start="450.139" data-end="452.419">slide basically is that instead of one</span> <span data-start="452.419" data-end="455.24">neuron doing the magic ones you have</span> <span data-start="455.24" data-end="457.58">multiple neurons that do it in parallel</span> <span data-start="457.58" data-end="461.33">and also sequentially so even though</span> <span data-start="461.33" data-end="463.13">each neuron changes values</span> <span data-start="463.13" data-end="465.68">deterministically the whole thing is not</span> <span data-start="465.68" data-end="469.82">deterministic okay so this is basically</span> <span data-start="469.82" data-end="471.77">the same representation that we saw</span> <span data-start="471.77" data-end="475.94">before except now i just changed in the</span> <span data-start="475.94" data-end="477.65">natural neurons with artificial neurons</span> <span data-start="477.65" data-end="481.729">and so for the for the math to work its</span> <span data-start="481.729" data-end="484.25">magic we need numerical representations</span> <span data-start="484.25" data-end="486.919">of our inputs and outputs so for example</span> <span data-start="486.919" data-end="488.9">we can represent a health bar in a</span> <span data-start="488.9" data-end="490.639">percentage which would be ninety-five</span> <span data-start="490.639" data-end="494.12">percent in this case but so I personally</span> <span data-start="494.12" data-end="496.46">think it's better to have like the most</span> <span data-start="496.46" data-end="498.71">information possible so instead of</span> <span data-start="498.71" data-end="500.93">saying this we have ninety-five percent</span> <span data-start="500.93" data-end="502.729">over health left we could say that our</span> <span data-start="502.729" data-end="504.919">maximum health or your current health is</span> <span data-start="504.919" data-end="508.91">114 and the maximum help is 120 and by</span> <span data-start="508.91" data-end="512.779">that or algorithm can deduce that it's</span> <span data-start="512.779" data-end="516.219">ninety-five percent and have left and</span> <span data-start="516.219" data-end="520.159">then we have the attack so the attack</span> <span data-start="520.159" data-end="523.099">isn't it could be a string or label but</span> <span data-start="523.099" data-end="525.9">in this case our neural network</span> <span data-start="525.9" data-end="528.15">needs a numerical value so it can</span> <span data-start="528.15" data-end="531.36">calculate on it and we could just give</span> <span data-start="531.36" data-end="533.31">it like an ID and then just map it</span> <span data-start="533.31" data-end="536.1">somewhere and but I didn't really like</span> <span data-start="536.1" data-end="538.92">that idea because I was afraid M that I</span> <span data-start="538.92" data-end="540.42">would introduce some numerical</span> <span data-start="540.42" data-end="542.82">implications that I don't want to for</span> <span data-start="542.82" data-end="545.46">example if attack is one and defense is</span> <span data-start="545.46" data-end="547.89">to then somehow my neural network could</span> <span data-start="547.89" data-end="550.29">think that the blocking action is like</span> <span data-start="550.29" data-end="552.57">twice the attack action so this doesn't</span> <span data-start="552.57" data-end="555.42">sound very smart one way to counter that</span> <span data-start="555.42" data-end="558.66">is to instead use a vector or an area in</span> <span data-start="558.66" data-end="562.32">the JavaScript context so by using this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="562.32" data-end="564.48">M airing I basically say that there are</span> <span data-start="564.48" data-end="566.37">three possible actions that the user</span> <span data-start="566.37" data-end="569.01">could take and he took the first one so</span> <span data-start="569.01" data-end="570.93">basically that's like a like a bull</span> <span data-start="570.93" data-end="574.68">array and so in this case the first</span> <span data-start="574.68" data-end="576.36">value would be attack and the second</span> <span data-start="576.36" data-end="577.89">would be defense and the third would be</span> <span data-start="577.89" data-end="583.77">potion so how do we get our predictions</span> <span data-start="583.77" data-end="588.03">and the first thing is I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="588.03" data-end="590.85">is going to call is called forward</span> <span data-start="590.85" data-end="593.37">propagation and it's called that because</span> <span data-start="593.37" data-end="596.43">we propagate data for word from our</span> <span data-start="596.43" data-end="600.18">input nodes to the output nodes so we</span> <span data-start="600.18" data-end="602.46">start with our inputs that's the one</span> <span data-start="602.46" data-end="604.8">you've seen before and then we send each</span> <span data-start="604.8" data-end="608.31">input to each node in the first layer so</span> <span data-start="608.31" data-end="610.38">let's focus on upper node so it's not so</span> <span data-start="610.38" data-end="613.68">complicated and in this node we do our</span> <span data-start="613.68" data-end="617.13">math magic so we have our weights and we</span> <span data-start="617.13" data-end="619.56">multiply it with our inputs and then we</span> <span data-start="619.56" data-end="623.85">get a new value which is X 11 because</span> <span data-start="623.85" data-end="625.44">it's the value we get from the first</span> <span data-start="625.44" data-end="627.84">node of the first layer and then we send</span> <span data-start="627.84" data-end="629.9">that new value to the next nodes and</span> <span data-start="629.9" data-end="633.09">then the lower note is the same thing</span> <span data-start="633.09" data-end="636.69">and in the next layer all the nodes do</span> <span data-start="636.69" data-end="638.46">exactly the same thing again of course</span> <span data-start="638.46" data-end="640.77">the weights are different here I just</span> <span data-start="640.77" data-end="643.68">call them D and E and then we get a</span> <span data-start="643.68" data-end="646.77">value in the end so I just I just said</span> <span data-start="646.77" data-end="651.03">that as 0.67 and because this would be</span> <span data-start="651.03" data-end="654.15">like the probability of the</span> <span data-start="654.15" data-end="656.04">action that is like directly linked to</span> <span data-start="656.04" data-end="657.93">this node because like each output node</span> <span data-start="657.93" data-end="664.02">is referring to one possible output okay</span> <span data-start="664.02" data-end="667.59">so now we have basically made</span> <span data-start="667.59" data-end="669.45">predictions from a training data but the</span> <span data-start="669.45" data-end="672.54">prediction is not that good because in</span> <span data-start="672.54" data-end="674.07">the first iteration which shoes are</span> <span data-start="674.07" data-end="677.7">weights randomly and now we have to like</span> <span data-start="677.7" data-end="679.89">the machine learns by trying to get</span> <span data-start="679.89" data-end="684.45">better at predicting stuff and so my</span> <span data-start="684.45" data-end="686.25">first instinct would be you could just</span> <span data-start="686.25" data-end="687.9">reverse engineer right because you have</span> <span data-start="687.9" data-end="690.42">the data and you know what's supposed to</span> <span data-start="690.42" data-end="692.4">be the output and then you can just like</span> <span data-start="692.4" data-end="694.65">reverse engineer and this is more or</span> <span data-start="694.65" data-end="696">less basically what the machine also</span> <span data-start="696" data-end="699.3">does this is called back propagation and</span> <span data-start="699.3" data-end="701.16">might have guessed already it's because</span> <span data-start="701.16" data-end="703.14">we propagate data back from the output</span> <span data-start="703.14" data-end="706.38">nodes to the input nodes and let's say</span> <span data-start="706.38" data-end="708.69">like these are our predictions this is</span> <span data-start="708.69" data-end="710.52">the probability that like for example a</span> <span data-start="710.52" data-end="712.32">human player would take this action with</span> <span data-start="712.32" data-end="714.99">the given inputs and then this is the</span> <span data-start="714.99" data-end="716.85">actual result this is like the truth</span> <span data-start="716.85" data-end="719.37">that we know from our data set and then</span> <span data-start="719.37" data-end="721.65">we need to figure out what the costs are</span> <span data-start="721.65" data-end="723.9">and the costs are basically just the</span> <span data-start="723.9" data-end="726.6">difference between the actual result and</span> <span data-start="726.6" data-end="729.42">what we predicted so in this case it</span> <span data-start="729.42" data-end="734.37">would be 0.33 0.14 and 0.19 respectively</span> <span data-start="734.37" data-end="738.81">and now inside the nodes we do not try</span> <span data-start="738.81" data-end="740.91">to get the right inputs instead we try</span> <span data-start="740.91" data-end="742.95">to calculate how we would have to change</span> <span data-start="742.95" data-end="745.95">the wave so the cost is lower next time</span> <span data-start="745.95" data-end="748.56">like in the next iteration and I'm not</span> <span data-start="748.56" data-end="750.21">going to go too deeply into that right</span> <span data-start="750.21" data-end="752.55">now because like it's very mathematical</span> <span data-start="752.55" data-end="755.94">and but after we've done that we will</span> <span data-start="755.94" data-end="758.19">back propagate the values the first</span> <span data-start="758.19" data-end="759.9">layer and we will do the same thing</span> <span data-start="759.9" data-end="764.64">there okay and so one way that we</span> <span data-start="764.64" data-end="767.1">calculate how to change the weights it's</span> <span data-start="767.1" data-end="768.66">called like gradient descent there are</span> <span data-start="768.66" data-end="770.67">other algorithms that you can use but in</span> <span data-start="770.67" data-end="772.41">this case I want to show you I'm the way</span> <span data-start="772.41" data-end="774.6">in descent because it's it's easy to</span> <span data-start="774.6" data-end="777.51">explain in a graphical representation so</span> <span data-start="777.51" data-end="782.7">um let's say our data is will be</span> <span data-start="782.7" data-end="785.19">represented in this 3d am representation</span> <span data-start="785.19" data-end="787.18">and we'll take a very simple</span> <span data-start="787.18" data-end="789.19">example would like only two numerical</span> <span data-start="789.19" data-end="791.29">features like only the max health and</span> <span data-start="791.29" data-end="795.12">the current health and then we have our</span> <span data-start="795.12" data-end="798.22">weights would so we do not plot the</span> <span data-start="798.22" data-end="801.13">actual input data we plot the weights so</span> <span data-start="801.13" data-end="804.97">that's a and B and then on the z axis we</span> <span data-start="804.97" data-end="808.9">plot the cost and so the idea is that in</span> <span data-start="808.9" data-end="812.38">the front you have high cost so the</span> <span data-start="812.38" data-end="813.94">predictions that you make are very far</span> <span data-start="813.94" data-end="816.46">from the actual reality and in the back</span> <span data-start="816.46" data-end="819.25">we have low cost and the way we plot</span> <span data-start="819.25" data-end="820.41">data in this three-dimensional</span> <span data-start="820.41" data-end="823.21">representation is we have those circles</span> <span data-start="823.21" data-end="825.55">the circle means that all the data</span> <span data-start="825.55" data-end="828.19">points that are on the circle so all the</span> <span data-start="828.19" data-end="829.87">combinations of a and B that are on the</span> <span data-start="829.87" data-end="832.96">circle have the same cost and then you</span> <span data-start="832.96" data-end="835.84">have different circles like this one and</span> <span data-start="835.84" data-end="837.85">it's the same here like all the</span> <span data-start="837.85" data-end="839.32">different data points on this circle</span> <span data-start="839.32" data-end="841.72">have the same cost although this circle</span> <span data-start="841.72" data-end="843.88">is a little bit darker and I made a</span> <span data-start="843.88" data-end="844.96">darker because I wanted to represent</span> <span data-start="844.96" data-end="848.02">that the cost is lower and so they all</span> <span data-start="848.02" data-end="850">have the same cost on the circle but of</span> <span data-start="850" data-end="852.94">course the differs from the from the</span> <span data-start="852.94" data-end="855.61">previous circle and then we you know</span> <span data-start="855.61" data-end="857.53">like further plot the data and then we</span> <span data-start="857.53" data-end="859.15">get like this kind of funnel where you</span> <span data-start="859.15" data-end="861.49">can just basically you look inside the</span> <span data-start="861.49" data-end="864.79">funnel and in the middle that's our</span> <span data-start="864.79" data-end="867.55">global minimum that's the point where</span> <span data-start="867.55" data-end="869.47">the cost is the lowest that we can ever</span> <span data-start="869.47" data-end="874.72">get with our with our algorithm so the</span> <span data-start="874.72" data-end="876.4">way that gradient descent now tries to</span> <span data-start="876.4" data-end="878.29">get there mathematically to the red dot</span> <span data-start="878.29" data-end="880.69">is that we have start somewhere randomly</span> <span data-start="880.69" data-end="882.07">like I said before we choose n be</span> <span data-start="882.07" data-end="884.47">randomly and then basically great into</span> <span data-start="884.47" data-end="888.52">the centers like walks steps towards the</span> <span data-start="888.52" data-end="890.98">global minimum and just like one was</span> <span data-start="890.98" data-end="893.2">around a little bit and just tries to</span> <span data-start="893.2" data-end="895">try to approximate the global minimum</span> <span data-start="895" data-end="898.42">and at some point hopefully it will get</span> <span data-start="898.42" data-end="900.43">there doesn't really happen that often</span> <span data-start="900.43" data-end="902.23">real life because we don't actually know</span> <span data-start="902.23" data-end="904.06">what the global minimum is we can see it</span> <span data-start="904.06" data-end="906.34">here because its graphical but if you</span> <span data-start="906.34" data-end="908.35">have a mathematical represent you don't</span> <span data-start="908.35" data-end="913.27">actually know and so the idea of this</span> <span data-start="913.27" data-end="914.82">whole thing is like we iteratively</span> <span data-start="914.82" data-end="917.97">approximate our model to the truth</span> <span data-start="917.97" data-end="921.54">okay so i hope you still with me because</span> <span data-start="921.54" data-end="924.899">this is gonna be a I'm not gonna go</span> <span data-start="924.899" data-end="927.389">further into it because it's interesting</span> <span data-start="927.389" data-end="929.579">to know how neural networks work but</span> <span data-start="929.579" data-end="931.379">when you implement something you want to</span> <span data-start="931.379" data-end="933.72">use a framework and not be bothered by</span> <span data-start="933.72" data-end="936.93">all the mathematical stuff and so I'm</span> <span data-start="936.93" data-end="940.98">gonna like introduce it another smart</span> <span data-start="940.98" data-end="944">guy who said this longer quote thing and</span> <span data-start="944" data-end="946.769">he says an approximate answers the right</span> <span data-start="946.769" data-end="948.689">problems were the good deal more than an</span> <span data-start="948.689" data-end="951.329">exact answer to approximate problem so</span> <span data-start="951.329" data-end="952.769">basically the better you describe your</span> <span data-start="952.769" data-end="954.959">problem the better your approximated</span> <span data-start="954.959" data-end="956.639">answer will fill it even though it's not</span> <span data-start="956.639" data-end="962.1">perfect so okay and let's implement</span> <span data-start="962.1" data-end="964.47">something I will not do a live demo</span> <span data-start="964.47" data-end="966.93">because I'm really scared and that's not</span> <span data-start="966.93" data-end="970.019">gonna work and I have used a node.js</span> <span data-start="970.019" data-end="972.06">library which is called synaptic and</span> <span data-start="972.06" data-end="973.829">like I said it implements all the fun</span> <span data-start="973.829" data-end="976.019">math stuff already and we just have to</span> <span data-start="976.019" data-end="978.72">like build the application so these are</span> <span data-start="978.72" data-end="981.449">22 lines of code and it's basically all</span> <span data-start="981.449" data-end="983.37">you need to predict a tendency with</span> <span data-start="983.37" data-end="985.079">their artificial network so we're not</span> <span data-start="985.079" data-end="987.75">doing like AI anymore for RPGs now we're</span> <span data-start="987.75" data-end="990.93">doing the prediction of soccer mattress</span> <span data-start="990.93" data-end="994.319">so first we have this historic data with</span> <span data-start="994.319" data-end="996.24">inputs in this case it's the market</span> <span data-start="996.24" data-end="998.579">value of the two teams home team and</span> <span data-start="998.579" data-end="1001.339">away team and then the output represents</span> <span data-start="1001.339" data-end="1003.98">the result so in this case the first</span> <span data-start="1003.98" data-end="1006.139">element would be that the home team won</span> <span data-start="1006.139" data-end="1007.879">the second element would be I'm</span> <span data-start="1007.879" data-end="1009.649">representing a draw and the third</span> <span data-start="1009.649" data-end="1012.05">element would be representing that the</span> <span data-start="1012.05" data-end="1015.92">away team won and then we have like</span> <span data-start="1015.92" data-end="1017.66">mattress that are that haven't happened</span> <span data-start="1017.66" data-end="1020.24">yet they have of course also inputs but</span> <span data-start="1020.24" data-end="1021.68">they don't have an output because of</span> <span data-start="1021.68" data-end="1024.14">course we don't have a result yet so</span> <span data-start="1024.14" data-end="1029.059">that makes two datasets basically and</span> <span data-start="1029.059" data-end="1031.819">then we have to build our network and we</span> <span data-start="1031.819" data-end="1035.089">use the number of input nodes that is</span> <span data-start="1035.089" data-end="1037.159">the same number of inputs we have and</span> <span data-start="1037.159" data-end="1041.059">then India we have three output nodes</span> <span data-start="1041.059" data-end="1043.309">because we have three different classes</span> <span data-start="1043.309" data-end="1045.409">that are possible and inside we have</span> <span data-start="1045.409" data-end="1047.689">hidden layers and I just like edges</span> <span data-start="1047.689" data-end="1050.85">chose two layers with six nodes</span> <span data-start="1050.85" data-end="1052.47">it's not the this is the law or</span> <span data-start="1052.47" data-end="1054.96">something and then we have to get a</span> <span data-start="1054.96" data-end="1058.53">trainer for a network and then we train</span> <span data-start="1058.53" data-end="1060.27">on it we tell them what the learning</span> <span data-start="1060.27" data-end="1061.89">rate is the learning rate is basically</span> <span data-start="1061.89" data-end="1063.539">the size of the steps that gradient</span> <span data-start="1063.539" data-end="1066.12">descent takes and this is also i just</span> <span data-start="1066.12" data-end="1069">chose that value and because it just</span> <span data-start="1069" data-end="1071.94">felt like it and also i have to define</span> <span data-start="1071.94" data-end="1073.77">the number of iterations which is how</span> <span data-start="1073.77" data-end="1075.36">often you go through the entire training</span> <span data-start="1075.36" data-end="1078.36">set to train your network and then when</span> <span data-start="1078.36" data-end="1079.799">we're done with training we actually</span> <span data-start="1079.799" data-end="1083.429">make predictions and if i would run the</span> <span data-start="1083.429" data-end="1085.76">script it would look something like this</span> <span data-start="1085.76" data-end="1089.309">so um what we can see like if we look at</span> <span data-start="1089.309" data-end="1092.309">the first prediction and the the home</span> <span data-start="1092.309" data-end="1094.32">team is worth less than half the of the</span> <span data-start="1094.32" data-end="1096.12">away team and the probability of winning</span> <span data-start="1096.12" data-end="1098.22">the match is also about half of the</span> <span data-start="1098.22" data-end="1100.71">probability to lose the match that seems</span> <span data-start="1100.71" data-end="1101.909">pretty straightforward and probably</span> <span data-start="1101.909" data-end="1104.37">whatever I would have predicted to if it</span> <span data-start="1104.37" data-end="1107.25">just only had those given data but when</span> <span data-start="1107.25" data-end="1108.83">we look at like the third prediction</span> <span data-start="1108.83" data-end="1111.179">although the home team is also worth</span> <span data-start="1111.179" data-end="1113.07">about half compared to the way team our</span> <span data-start="1113.07" data-end="1115.08">machine predicts that is likely more</span> <span data-start="1115.08" data-end="1116.76">likely for the home team to win the game</span> <span data-start="1116.76" data-end="1119.46">and this could have a lot of like this</span> <span data-start="1119.46" data-end="1120.87">could have a lot of meanings it could</span> <span data-start="1120.87" data-end="1122.58">mean that there's something like a home</span> <span data-start="1122.58" data-end="1125.13">team advantage or there's like a</span> <span data-start="1125.13" data-end="1127.679">different like implication that we don't</span> <span data-start="1127.679" data-end="1129.84">know about and the problem with machine</span> <span data-start="1129.84" data-end="1132.419">learning and prediction is that we don't</span> <span data-start="1132.419" data-end="1134.19">really know how our machine gets there</span> <span data-start="1134.19" data-end="1136.59">because it's non deterministic and those</span> <span data-start="1136.59" data-end="1138.6">model is purely mathematical and the</span> <span data-start="1138.6" data-end="1140.309">weights don't translate into something</span> <span data-start="1140.309" data-end="1142.71">that you can understand intuitively so</span> <span data-start="1142.71" data-end="1144.78">we can reverse engineer something like</span> <span data-start="1144.78" data-end="1146.61">home team advantage unless we actually</span> <span data-start="1146.61" data-end="1151.32">implemented it okay so I hope you're</span> <span data-start="1151.32" data-end="1154.409">still with me and this is how we</span> <span data-start="1154.409" data-end="1156.63">implemented it now we have got like our</span> <span data-start="1156.63" data-end="1160.289">predictions and then now how do we know</span> <span data-start="1160.289" data-end="1161.97">how well we're actually doing with our</span> <span data-start="1161.97" data-end="1164.94">algorithm and if we know how we're doing</span> <span data-start="1164.94" data-end="1166.89">how can we implement how can we improve</span> <span data-start="1166.89" data-end="1171.57">it so um when we want to figure figure</span> <span data-start="1171.57" data-end="1173.159">out how our algorithm performs there's</span> <span data-start="1173.159"

data-start="1360.88" data-end="1365.32">like jumps around and so okay we know</span> <span data-start="1365.32" data-end="1367.3">those error rates and I'm going to skip</span> <span data-start="1367.3" data-end="1369.37">the slide real quick because it's just</span> <span data-start="1369.37" data-end="1372.73">like a summary and and the next question</span> <span

data-start="1385.12" data-end="1388.54">to try to improve the improve the</span> <span data-start="1388.54" data-end="1390.64">algorithm first thing is adjusting the</span> <span data-start="1390.64" data-end="1392.32">learning rate so we saw that the error</span> <span data-start="1392.32" data-end="1394.21">rate was jumping like up and down and up</span> <span data-start="1394.21" data-end="1396.19">and down and this could mean that we</span> <span data-start="1396.19" data-end="1397.81">already like reach the global minimum</span> <span data-start="1397.81" data-end="1399.94">and are just like wandering around it</span> <span data-start="1399.94" data-end="1403.66">and I just wanted to like try what would</span> <span data-start="1403.66" data-end="1406.63">happen if I just changed the learning</span> <span data-start="1406.63" data-end="1409.03">rate so this is the error rate that we</span> <span data-start="1409.03" data-end="1411.99">had before with the am learning rate of</span> <span data-start="1411.99" data-end="1415.9">0.003 and then I just changed it to 0 0</span> <span data-start="1415.9" data-end="1419.59">to 1 and this is what happened what you</span> <span data-start="1419.59" data-end="1421.33">can see is that the error it is a little</span> <span data-start="1421.33" data-end="1424.15">bit higher but now it like slowly goes</span> <span data-start="1424.15" data-end="1425.53">down and doesn't like walk around</span> <span data-start="1425.53" data-end="1428.8">anymore and this could mean that if I do</span> <span data-start="1428.8" data-end="1431.29">more iterations I will get a better like</span> <span data-start="1431.29" data-end="1433.18">error wait I will be closer to the</span> <span data-start="1433.18" data-end="1435.28">global minimum even though my steps are</span> <span data-start="1435.28" data-end="1438.58">smaller and in this case I just decided</span> <span data-start="1438.58" data-end="1440.26">to leave it at that to just show you</span> <span data-start="1440.26" data-end="1442.05">what what can happen</span> <span data-start="1442.05" data-end="1444.18">when you change the learning rate and I</span> <span data-start="1444.18" data-end="1446.73">wanted to try some other stuff too so</span> <span data-start="1446.73" data-end="1448.5">the next thing I wanted to try was to</span> <span data-start="1448.5" data-end="1451.59">just simply get more data and i get i</span> <span data-start="1451.59" data-end="1454.5">just added in to new seasons which was</span> <span data-start="1454.5" data-end="1457.53">100% more data and again this is the</span> <span data-start="1457.53" data-end="1459">learning rate from before the error</span> <span data-start="1459" data-end="1461.31">rates from before and these are the</span> <span data-start="1461.31" data-end="1463.35">error rates after i added more data and</span> <span data-start="1463.35" data-end="1466.19">what you can see is that between the</span> <span data-start="1466.19" data-end="1468.9">10,000 iteration in the 100,000th</span> <span data-start="1468.9" data-end="1471.12">iteration there is like a bigger</span> <span data-start="1471.12" data-end="1474.09">difference with more data then with less</span> <span data-start="1474.09" data-end="1476.58">data which means like if you train your</span> <span data-start="1476.58" data-end="1478.65">algorithm like a hundred thousand four</span> <span data-start="1478.65" data-end="1480.3">hundred thousand integrations but the</span> <span data-start="1480.3" data-end="1481.92">error rate doesn't change that much you</span> <span data-start="1481.92" data-end="1485.04">don't really have to write so this could</span> <span data-start="1485.04" data-end="1486.96">mean that it actually would be worth</span> <span data-start="1486.96" data-end="1491.52">your time to get more data and then the</span> <span data-start="1491.52" data-end="1493.29">last thing that I tried was to simply</span> <span data-start="1493.29" data-end="1495.81">add more features to give the algorithm</span> <span data-start="1495.81" data-end="1498.3">or inputs which would also just mean</span> <span data-start="1498.3" data-end="1500.13">that I'm describing the problem better</span> <span data-start="1500.13" data-end="1504.18">or more detailed so before I had two</span> <span data-start="1504.18" data-end="1506.13">features those were the market values of</span> <span data-start="1506.13" data-end="1509.58">the two teams and now i just added like</span> <span data-start="1509.58" data-end="1512.1">three more features and the positions of</span> <span data-start="1512.1" data-end="1514.41">the teams in the table before the match</span> <span data-start="1514.41" data-end="1517.83">starts and also the MH day so I'm saying</span> <span data-start="1517.83" data-end="1519.84">probably it does have an influence how</span> <span data-start="1519.84" data-end="1521.85">far into the season we are and how well</span> <span data-start="1521.85" data-end="1524.43">they are compared to other teams and now</span> <span data-start="1524.43" data-end="1525.99">if we look at the error rate right now</span> <span data-start="1525.99" data-end="1528.54">looks pretty good except that the</span> <span data-start="1528.54" data-end="1530.49">cross-validation error seems to go up at</span> <span data-start="1530.49" data-end="1532.71">some point but it still is performing</span> <span data-start="1532.71" data-end="1534.54">better than having only two features so</span> <span data-start="1534.54" data-end="1536.58">we could say from that that it might</span> <span data-start="1536.58" data-end="1538.56">make sense to put more effort into</span> <span data-start="1538.56" data-end="1543.99">getting more features so yeah those are</span> <span data-start="1543.99" data-end="1547.28">the things that I actually tried and</span> <span data-start="1547.28" data-end="1549.87">this is basically just prototyping stuff</span> <span data-start="1549.87" data-end="1551.7">just trying stuff out and then decide</span> <span data-start="1551.7" data-end="1554.04">what would be like worth my time the</span> <span data-start="1554.04"

data-end="1560.34">scientists use but I unfortunate don't</span> <span data-start="1560.34" data-end="1562.02">have the time to really go that deep</span> <span data-start="1562.02" data-end="1563.4">into it but we can talk about it later</span> <span data-start="1563.4" data-end="1569.21">after the talk and okay so I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="1569.21"
