data-start="587.769" data-end="593.709">a there's a tricky thing here which well</span> <span data-start="593.709" data-end="595.059">so let's take the switch statement and</span> <span data-start="595.059" data-end="596.23">first let's switch it over to this</span> <span data-start="596.23" data-end="597.579">object approach that we were discussing</span> <span data-start="597.579" data-end="600.04">before so if we were to do that what we</span> <span data-start="600.04" data-end="601.179">would do is cut out that switch</span> <span data-start="601.179"

data-end="607.72">all of the different types of actions</span> <span data-start="607.72" data-end="609.459">and then on the right hand it has the</span> <span data-start="609.459" data-end="612.22">how we want to update the state then at</span> <span data-start="612.22" data-end="613.42">the bottom we would go ahead and pull</span> <span data-start="613.42" data-end="614.8">out that case or we would return the</span> <span data-start="614.8" data-end="619.24">default so here we run into concern</span> <span data-start="619.24" data-end="622.72">which is to illustrate it a little more</span> <span data-start="622.72" data-end="625.389">let's think about what if we could</span> <span data-start="625.389" data-end="628.389">change instead of always updating or</span> <span data-start="628.389" data-end="630.61">decrementing by one what if we can make</span> <span data-start="630.61" data-end="633.519">that an arbitrary amount so now the</span> <span data-start="633.519" data-end="635.05">amount that we're gonna increment or</span> <span data-start="635.05" data-end="637.149">decrement by is also going to flow in</span> <span data-start="637.149" data-end="640.809">with this action so here at the very top</span> <span data-start="640.809" data-end="643.3">we have just a little bit of</span> <span data-start="643.3" data-end="644.649">destructuring if it's not something</span> <span data-start="644.649" data-end="646.179">you're familiar with we'll talk about it</span> <span data-start="646.179" data-end="648.189">a little later so we're gonna reach into</span> <span data-start="648.189" data-end="649.779">that action and we're gonna pull out the</span> <span data-start="649.779" data-end="651.699">type of the action we're also going to</span> <span data-start="651.699" data-end="653.589">pull out the data of the action and as</span> <span data-start="653.589" data-end="655.47">we do that we'll rename it to the amount</span> <span data-start="655.47" data-end="658.179">then inside of our case is what we want</span> <span data-start="658.179" data-end="660.22">to do is increment state by the amount</span> <span data-start="660.22" data-end="663.369">and decrement state by amount so here we</span> <span data-start="663.369" data-end="666.369">run into a bug and the bug is that if</span> <span data-start="666.369" data-end="670.029">we're in the case of reset all we want</span> <span data-start="670.029" data-end="671.92">to do is reset the state to zero so</span> <span data-start="671.92" data-end="673.119">we're not incrementing or decrementing</span> <span data-start="673.119" data-end="676.029">by any amount so it would make perfect</span> <span data-start="676.029" data-end="679.36">sense for amount to be  how</span> <span data-start="679.36" data-end="682.779">as soon as we hit this skate statement</span> <span data-start="682.779" data-end="684.25">definition as soon as we call this</span> <span data-start="684.25" data-end="686.8">function we're eagerly gonna evaluate</span> <span data-start="686.8" data-end="690.31">what state plus amount means and that</span> <span data-start="690.31" data-end="691.66">means that we're either gonna get state</span> <span data-start="691.66" data-end="694.209">plus  state plus null state -</span> <span data-start="694.209" data-end="696.79">no this is bad i I didn't run this to be</span> <span data-start="696.79" data-end="698.05">sure but I'm pretty sure this would</span> <span data-start="698.05" data-end="700.89">result in your program just blowing up</span> <span data-start="700.89" data-end="704.589">so the way to avoid this is that instead</span> <span data-start="704.589" data-end="707.35">of just having cases the return of value</span> <span data-start="707.35" data-end="710.41">we would instead make the cases return a</span> <span data-start="710.41" data-end="713.11">function so that when you evaluate the</span> <span data-start="713.11" data-end="715.899">function at that point we do that math</span> <span data-start="715.899" data-end="717.519">and this would make sure that when you</span> <span data-start="717.519" data-end="720.279">hit the reset case it hasn't evaluated</span> <span data-start="720.279" data-end="722.74">the other two cases and it would avoid</span> <span data-start="722.74" data-end="726.1">this bug so this means that you know at</span> <span data-start="726.1" data-end="728.17">the bottom now we're gonna be having to</span> <span data-start="728.17" data-end="731.35">call will pull out our case from the</span> <span data-start="731.35" data-end="733.18">object and then we'll have to evaluate</span> <span data-start="733.18" data-end="735.01">it and we'll do that again for the</span> <span data-start="735.01" data-end="738.37">default case and this isn't I mean it's</span> <span data-start="738.37" data-end="740.62">not terrible it just seems to me like a</span> <span data-start="740.62" data-end="742.81">lot of ceremony for something that a</span> <span data-start="742.81" data-end="745.6">language could and should be able to</span> <span data-start="745.6" data-end="748.54">handle for you and a lot of languages do</span> <span data-start="748.54" data-end="750.61">so let's backtrack now and talk about a</span> <span data-start="750.61" data-end="752.47">couple other ones so here's for example</span> <span data-start="752.47" data-end="755.199">elm Elm is a language that embraces</span> <span data-start="755.199" data-end="757.51">switch statements a lot in fact so much</span> <span data-start="757.51" data-end="759.519">so that in Elm it's considered a code</span> <span data-start="759.519" data-end="762.25">smell to use an if statement or any</span> <span data-start="762.25" data-end="765.22">other type of evaluation if a case would</span> <span data-start="765.22" data-end="769.779">do so here in Elm and an action is a</span> <span data-start="769.779" data-end="773.62">data type and the data type would be one</span> <span data-start="773.62" data-end="775.99">of a bunch of different cases then when</span> <span data-start="775.99" data-end="779.199">a case could involve with it some data</span> <span data-start="779.199" data-end="781.69">attached to it so here when we're in the</span> <span data-start="781.69" data-end="783.82">increment case will automatically get</span> <span data-start="783.82" data-end="785.98">another bit of data with it which is the</span> <span data-start="785.98" data-end="788.01">amount and when we hit the reset case</span> <span data-start="788.01" data-end="790.6">reset has no amount so it just wouldn't</span> <span data-start="790.6" data-end="793.709">be a part of that data type at all in</span> <span data-start="793.709" data-end="796.899">rust there's something very similar so</span> <span data-start="796.899" data-end="799.06">we would have an action which is a</span> <span data-start="799.06" data-end="801.61">struct which has two different type in</span> <span data-start="801.61" data-end="803.32">an amount to find on it and then we</span> <span data-start="803.32" data-end="805.149">would have a function that matches over</span> <span data-start="805.149" data-end="807.22">that type and then lets you do different</span> <span data-start="807.22" data-end="809.649">stuff based on it if you actually know</span> <span data-start="809.649" data-end="811.48">any rust don't look at this too closely</span> <span data-start="811.48" data-end="813.25">because I don't and I have a</span> <span data-start="813.25" data-end="816.46">this actually doesn't compile and then</span> <span data-start="816.46" data-end="817.66">the one that we're gonna focus on the</span> <span data-start="817.66" data-end="820.03">most is elixir the reason why we're</span> <span data-start="820.03" data-end="822.28">gonna do that is because elixir has the</span> <span data-start="822.28" data-end="824.38">closest semantics out of these languages</span> <span data-start="824.38" data-end="827.14">to JavaScript so in elixir we would</span> <span data-start="827.14" data-end="829.27">define a function the function would</span> <span data-start="829.27" data-end="831.37">take a state and in action we would case</span> <span data-start="831.37" data-end="834.27">over that action and then if it matched</span> <span data-start="834.27" data-end="836.83">whether we wanted to increment decrement</span> <span data-start="836.83" data-end="840.55">or reset we would do we would take the</span> <span data-start="840.55" data-end="842.23">amount calculate a new state based off</span> <span data-start="842.23" data-end="846.85">of it and this leaves us with a question</span> <span data-start="846.85" data-end="849.04">of if all these other languages have a</span> <span data-start="849.04" data-end="852.79">way of doing robust handling of cases</span> <span data-start="852.79" data-end="854.83">why can't we have something like that in</span> </p>

data-start="1103.86" data-end="1106.05">arguments so let's say that we have an</span> <span data-start="1106.05" data-end="1108.51">array with four things in it we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1108.51" data-end="1110.25">take the first out of it and put it into</span> <span data-start="1110.25" data-end="1112.83">a variable X but then this triple dot</span> <span data-start="1112.83" data-end="1114.84">syntax what it's gonna do is it's gonna</span> <span data-start="1114.84" data-end="1116.97">take all the rest of the contents of</span> <span

data-end="1123.57">we have one variable of the first and</span> <span data-start="1123.57" data-end="1125.34">another variable which is the entire</span> <span data-start="1125.34" data-end="1129.18">tail this is really cool and so having</span> <span data-start="1129.18" data-end="1131.79">covered all of that 4d structuring let's</span> <span data-start="1131.79" data-end="1133.65">talk about how this would fit into the</span> <span data-start="1133.65" data-end="1138.59">pattern matching proposal so here is the</span> <span data-start="1138.59" data-end="1141.75">update state or the update counter that</span> <span data-start="1141.75" data-end="1143.85">we discussed earlier with Redux handlers</span> <span data-start="1143.85" data-end="1146.13">and how we would do this if we had</span> <span data-start="1146.13" data-end="1148.8">pattern matching available so we will do</span> <span data-start="1148.8" data-end="1151.08">a case statement and the case statement</span> <span data-start="1151.08" data-end="1153.93">will switch over the type of the action</span> <span data-start="1153.93" data-end="1156.63">then the proposed semantics right now</span> <span data-start="1156.63" data-end="1161.22">have this new keyword when and with when</span> <span data-start="1161.22" data-end="1163.5">you would put the value that you want to</span> <span data-start="1163.5" data-end="1165.9">match against next to it and then an</span> <span data-start="1165.9" data-end="1168.21">arrow and afterwards whatever you want</span> <span data-start="1168.21" data-end="1170.22">to do so here would be saying that if</span> <span data-start="1170.22" data-end="1173.22">the type of action directly matches the</span> <span data-start="1173.22" data-end="1175.47">string increment then we can go ahead</span> <span data-start="1175.47" data-end="1178.74">and evaluate the state with +1 so this</span> <span data-start="1178.74" data-end="1181.65">is this is cool however that's not where</span> <span data-start="1181.65" data-end="1184.29">we stopped so because we can use all of</span> <span data-start="1184.29" data-end="1186.57">this destructuring semantics we can go</span> <span data-start="1186.57" data-end="1188.52">ahead and just case over the entire</span> <span data-start="1188.52" data-end="1191.7">action when we case over the action we</span> <span data-start="1191.7" data-end="1195.03">can on the right hand of then do a D</span> <span data-start="1195.03" data-end="1197.46">structuring so we can say that if the</span> <span data-start="1197.46" data-end="1201.57">action has a type property and that type</span> <span data-start="1201.57" data-end="1203.67">property matches the string increment</span> <span data-start="1203.67" data-end="1206.79">then what we want to do is pull out the</span> <span data-start="1206.79" data-end="1209.88">property data but rename that to amount</span> <span data-start="1209.88" data-end="1212.49">and now the variables that we've decided</span> <span data-start="1212.49" data-end="1214.74">to find inside of that destructor</span> <span data-start="1214.74" data-end="1218.07">are available to the other side of that</span> <span data-start="1218.07" data-end="1219.72">arrow so we can just go ahead and say</span> <span data-start="1219.72" data-end="1221.88">state plus amount which we've received</span> <span data-start="1221.88" data-end="1224.159">from that destructuring this is really</span> <span data-start="1224.159" data-end="1225.899">cool and we can do it with a raise as</span> <span data-start="1225.899" data-end="1228">well so another way to do this would be</span> <span data-start="1228" data-end="1230.61">that we could do a case statement over a</span> <span data-start="1230.61" data-end="1233.49">new array and the array could have the</span> <span data-start="1233.49" data-end="1235.5">type of the action and the data of the</span> <span data-start="1235.5" data-end="1238.049">action and then all we would do is we</span> <span data-start="1238.049" data-end="1240.809">would match against the first value</span> <span data-start="1240.809" data-end="1243.24">being increment and then we would just</span> <span data-start="1243.24" data-end="1244.919">put the second value into a variable</span> <span data-start="1244.919" data-end="1247.049">amount we could do that the same with</span> <span data-start="1247.049" data-end="1249.87">decrement and this is okay another one</span> <span data-start="1249.87" data-end="1252.33">that I skipped over before but when we</span> <span data-start="1252.33" data-end="1254.46">get to the bottom we're doing variable</span> <span data-start="1254.46" data-end="1256.62">assignment so any variable that we put</span> <span data-start="1256.62" data-end="1259.98">here will get assigned into there so the</span> <span data-start="1259.98" data-end="1262.32">effect of this of this when underscore</span> <span data-start="1262.32" data-end="1265.289">is the same effect as a default case so</span> <span data-start="1265.289" data-end="1267.45">what we'll do is we'll say if we get to</span> <span data-start="1267.45" data-end="1268.89">this point in the function and we</span> <span data-start="1268.89" data-end="1270.36">haven't matched any previous case</span> <span data-start="1270.36" data-end="1273.57">whatever we've put in the case we'll</span> <span data-start="1273.57" data-end="1275.01">just instead be a sign into this</span> <span data-start="1275.01" data-end="1277.2">variable and we'll match this instead so</span> <span data-start="1277.2" data-end="1279.299">this is a really cool really easy way to</span> <span data-start="1279.299" data-end="1282">do default arguments or to do default</span> <span data-start="1282" data-end="1285.149">cases other places where this could</span> <span data-start="1285.149" data-end="1287.309">apply could be in nodejs</span> <span data-start="1287.309" data-end="1290.039">so in node a really common thing is to</span> <span data-start="1290.039" data-end="1293.669">have air backs or error first call backs</span> <span data-start="1293.669" data-end="1296.909">so here we could be reading a file we</span> <span data-start="1296.909" data-end="1298.679">passed the first argument is the name of</span> <span data-start="1298.679" data-end="1300.45">the file the second is the encoding we</span> <span data-start="1300.45" data-end="1302.669">want to read out of and then inside of</span> <span data-start="1302.669" data-end="1304.559">our callback we could do a case</span> <span data-start="1304.559" data-end="1306.69">statement over the error that we could</span> <span data-start="1306.69" data-end="1310.049">possibly get back and the contents so</span> <span data-start="1310.049" data-end="1312.39">here the first step that we would do is</span> <span data-start="1312.39" data-end="1315.179">we could say if the error is explicitly</span> <span data-start="1315.179" data-end="1317.82">null which is idiomatically where you'll</span> <span data-start="1317.82" data-end="1320.25">always get back a node then we can go</span> <span data-start="1320.25" data-end="1322.11">ahead and match this case because we</span> <span data-start="1322.11" data-end="1323.429">know that the error is null and</span> <span data-start="1323.429" data-end="1325.08">therefore we have some data we can do</span> <span data-start="1325.08" data-end="1328.14">stuff with it then in the next statement</span> <span data-start="1328.14" data-end="1329.52">we could do is alright if the error</span> <span data-start="1329.52" data-end="1332.13">isn't null and we have an error let's go</span> <span data-start="1332.13" data-end="1333.659">ahead and pull that out and then we'll</span> <span data-start="1333.659" data-end="1335.1">do some error handling something went</span> <span data-start="1335.1" data-end="1336.899">wrong and then we could have another</span> <span data-start="1336.899" data-end="1339">statement after that saying for some</span> <span data-start="1339" data-end="1341.73">reason the error isn't no but it's also</span> <span data-start="1341.73" data-end="1344.58">not true T value so something went wrong</span> <span data-start="1344.58" data-end="1346.32">here I think that case would actually be</span> <span data-start="1346.32" data-end="1348.54">impossible and node unless someone it</span> <span data-start="1348.54" data-end="1351.33">explicitly returned false to you I guess</span> <span data-start="1351.33" data-end="1354.17">is the only way that it would happen but</span> <span data-start="1354.17" data-end="1356.34">yeah it's cool that basically we could</span> <span data-start="1356.34" data-end="1359.1">take apart which is very idiomatic and</span> <span data-start="1359.1" data-end="1361.29">node and done everywhere but handle it</span> <span data-start="1361.29" data-end="1365.52">in in a really nice concise new way this</span> <span data-start="1365.52" data-end="1367.35">could also be used in JSX was actually</span> <span data-start="1367.35" data-end="1369.24">one of the motivating examples I don't</span> <span data-start="1369.24" data-end="1370.47">know how many of you have tried to in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1370.47" data-end="1373.56">JSX do any type of conditionals but you</span> <span data-start="1373.56" data-end="1375.72">have to do you have to return something</span> <span data-start="1375.72" data-end="1379.5">and usually you do a condition and and</span> <span data-start="1379.5" data-end="1382.14">the value that you want to return and if</span> <span data-start="1382.14" data-end="1383.79">you want to do turn Aries then you have</span> <span data-start="1383.79" data-end="1386.4">to do the condition question mark and do</span> <span data-start="1386.4" data-end="1388.47">a few of them if you have multiple cases</span> <span data-start="1388.47" data-end="1390.18">there's no nice way to do that you have</span> <span data-start="1390.18" data-end="1392.49">to do the nested turn Aries so here what</span> <span data-start="1392.49" data-end="1393.78">it would look like is that we could have</span> <span data-start="1393.78" data-end="1395.76">a component and let's say that the</span> <span data-start="1395.76" data-end="1398.01">component inside of its props could</span> <span data-start="1398.01" data-end="1400.32">either be in a loading state or it could</span> <span data-start="1400.32" data-end="1403.05">have some errors or it could have none</span> <span data-start="1403.05" data-end="1404.49">of those and then it just gives you the</span> <span data-start="1404.49" data-end="1406.32">data back so instead what we would do is</span> <span data-start="1406.32" data-end="1407.76">we would just do a case over the props</span> <span data-start="1407.76" data-end="1410.04">and we would tell it how to handle each</span> <span data-start="1410.04" data-end="1411.72">of those and what to return in each of</span> <span data-start="1411.72" data-end="1414.03">those cases I encourage you to write the</span> <span data-start="1414.03" data-end="1415.38">same example in JSX</span> <span data-start="1415.38" data-end="1416.7">and then see what you think about this</span> <span data-start="1416.7" data-end="1418.29">proposal afterwards cuz this this is</span> <span data-start="1418.29" data-end="1422.82">super nice so having talked about all of</span> <span data-start="1422.82" data-end="1424.41">that let's talk about where pattern</span> <span data-start="1424.41" data-end="1426">matching is because like I mentioned</span> <span data-start="1426" data-end="1429.33">it's not reality right now so right now</span> <span data-start="1429.33" data-end="1433.62">it's a proposal in stage one of tc39 so</span> <span data-start="1433.62" data-end="1435.99">stage one is that it's been evaluated</span> <span data-start="1435.99" data-end="1437.55">it's been talked about and it's</span> <span data-start="1437.55" data-end="1439.83">interesting enough that tc39 is</span> <span data-start="1439.83" data-end="1443.1">interested in pursuing pursuing it more</span> <span data-start="1443.1" data-end="1444.36">and figuring out what it would take to</span> <span data-start="1444.36" data-end="1446.55">make this a part of the language so this</span> <span data-start="1446.55" data-end="1448.26">means that the semantics are being</span> <span data-start="1448.26" data-end="1450.06">discussed a lot more all of the edge</span> <span data-start="1450.06" data-end="1451.86">cases are trying to be identified so</span> <span data-start="1451.86" data-end="1453.87">that we can define how would this fit</span> <span data-start="1453.87" data-end="1457.1">into the language what's really cool I</span> <span data-start="1457.1" data-end="1459.39">didn't know a lot about this until</span> <span data-start="1459.39" data-end="1462.75">researching this talk tc39 is a github</span> <span data-start="1462.75" data-end="1465.81">organization and basically all of the</span> <span data-start="1465.81" data-end="1467.97">documents that go into the language that</span> <span data-start="1467.97" data-end="1471.12">all of us use are just documents on</span> <span data-start="1471.12" data-end="1474.54">github so the the repository for pattern</span> <span data-start="1474.54" data-end="1477.21">matching is right now just some readme</span> <span data-start="1477.21" data-end="1479.25">files that you can go through you can in</span> <span data-start="1479.25" data-end="1481.44">your head kind of say oh what what would</span> <span data-start="1481.44" data-end="1482.279">it mean in this case</span> <span data-start="1482.279" data-end="1483.509">what would it mean in this other case</span> <span data-start="1483.509" data-end="1485.849">you can open up issues saying I'm not</span> <span data-start="1485.849" data-end="1487.289">sure it would work the way that I would</span> <span data-start="1487.289" data-end="1489.96">expect it in here what does that mean so</span> <span data-start="1489.96" data-end="1491.759">this means that right now contributing</span> <span data-start="1491.759" data-end="1493.649">to the proposal is really easy it's all</span> <span data-start="1493.649" data-end="1496.2">just thought experiments the next step</span> <span data-start="1496.2" data-end="1498.059">after this would be to figure out how to</span> <span data-start="1498.059" data-end="1499.59">actually play around with it and how to</span>
