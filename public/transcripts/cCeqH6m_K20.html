<p><span data-start="19.01" data-end="27.1">So my name is Lara Schenck, and that's my Twitter handle.</span> <span data-start="27.1" data-end="33.16">I'm a freelance WordPress and front-end developer in WordPress and CSS are my two loves, as</span> <span data-start="33.16" data-end="34.39">well as teaching.</span> <span data-start="34.39" data-end="39.329">I love teaching been are sharing what I know, and using teaching as a means to get myself</span> <span data-start="39.329" data-end="48.179">to to learn things which is kind of what I did with this talk.</span> <span data-start="48.179" data-end="52.26">So, CSS: it has a special place in my heart as I'm sure it does for most of us here.</span> <span data-start="52.26" data-end="55.129">I have a background in art.</span> <span data-start="55.129" data-end="62.69">I came upon CSS through a weird college project — art project — where I wanted it to turn</span> <span data-start="62.69" data-end="67.93">it into a video game which morphed into making WordPress sites pour money which turned into</span> <span data-start="67.93" data-end="71.47">- for money which turned into a career I love.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="71.47" data-end="76.369">Computer science didn't turn up in my career until three years ago or so.</span> <span data-start="76.369" data-end="82.81">I got good at making websites but didn't understand what was happening under the surface.</span> <span data-start="82.81" data-end="85.89">This showed up in the form of an algorithms interview.</span> <span data-start="85.89" data-end="90.18">How many of us have done an algorithms whiteboarding interview before?</span> <span data-start="90.18" data-end="92.78">Good amount of hands.</span> <span data-start="92.78" data-end="94.84">Questionable interviewing stale but it exists.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="94.84" data-end="98.59">So, that was my first encounter.</span> <span data-start="98.59" data-end="103.74">I definitely failed it, and then about a year ago I got an interview for a job I was excited</span> <span data-start="103.74" data-end="104.74">about.</span> <span data-start="104.74" data-end="108.03">I thought I've got to take this one seriously, and I've got to learn about computer science.</span> <span data-start="108.03" data-end="109.93">So I really grew to love it.</span> <span data-start="109.93" data-end="115.22">The connection between computer science and CSS wasn't always clear.</span> <span data-start="115.22" data-end="119.42">Like I saw the connections between my work with JavaScript and with PHP quite often,</span> <span data-start="119.42" data-end="122.009">but with CSS, it was hard to bridge that gap.</span> <span data-start="122.009" data-end="127.25">So, in the spirit of committing to teach things in order to learn them, I proposed this talk</span> <span data-start="127.25" data-end="129.759">for CSSconf EU.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="129.759" data-end="135.54">And I started my research for this about six months ago, and CSS really went from something</span> <span data-start="135.54" data-end="141.31">like this — so grey, like I was got to write CSS, it is not as interesting as the other</span> <span data-start="141.31" data-end="146.34">programming stuff I'm doing — and then over the six months of research, CSS became like,</span> <span data-start="146.34" data-end="148.95">"Oh, my God, CSS is so cool.</span> <span data-start="148.95" data-end="150.15">The dream!</span> <span data-start="150.15" data-end="151.94">This is awesome."</span> <span data-start="151.94" data-end="158.3">In addition to those kind of like revitalisation of my love for CSS, my code got better and</span> <span data-start="158.3" data-end="162.93">intentional, and I write code faster.</span> <span data-start="162.93" data-end="169.19">I want to share with you how I got to that point in my journey in this research.</span> <span data-start="169.19" data-end="179.04">To I started all of this with a question: is CSS a programming language?</span> <span data-start="179.04" data-end="180.63">How many of you have thought about this before?</span> <span data-start="180.63" data-end="183.56">Good, nice number of hands.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.56" data-end="189.23">I want to follow up this with a fire emoji because this is a hot topic lately.</span> <span data-start="189.23" data-end="193.78">I posed this question on Twitter: is CSS a programming language?</span> <span data-start="193.78" data-end="201.26">The results were about as expected: 42 per cent, no; 50 per cent — or rather 42 per cent,</span> <span data-start="201.26" data-end="204.44">yes; 50 per cent, no; eight per cent, I'm not sure.</span> <span data-start="204.44" data-end="210.7">The responses to the tweet were, "The yeses were absolutely, it is a programming language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="210.7" data-end="213.04">For sure."</span> <span data-start="213.04" data-end="219.35">And the noes were more like, "You can't really call programming a web page layout, you don't</span> <span data-start="219.35" data-end="221.37">say you programme in CSS."</span> <span data-start="221.37" data-end="225.07">It's not what it is like.</span> <span data-start="225.07" data-end="229.22">I mulled this over and thought, stop.</span> <span data-start="229.22" data-end="234.65">I think we might be get some opinions, and like personal experience mixed up with facts</span> <span data-start="234.65" data-end="236.01">here.</span> <span data-start="236.01" data-end="241.59">So let's start by asking what is a programming language?</span> <span data-start="241.59" data-end="246.29">Ground breaking it definition coming up: a language of instructions for a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="246.29" data-end="253.29">The thing is, the definition of a programming language is kind of intentionally vague.</span> <span data-start="253.29" data-end="260.72">There are many, many types of programming languages.</span> <span data-start="260.72" data-end="265.639">Soon after reading about the definition of a programming limitation, one would encounter</span> <span data-start="265.639" data-end="271.36">programming paradigms, and the term "paradigm" is really a word for a general classification</span> <span data-start="271.36" data-end="278.319">or model or style of doing something, and there are two main classifications in programming</span> <span data-start="278.319" data-end="283.939">paradigms: imperative programming paradigm which refers to code that tells a computer</span> <span data-start="283.939" data-end="286.389">how to do something.</span> <span data-start="286.389" data-end="289.729">And there is declarative, which is code that tells a computer what to do.</span> <span data-start="289.729" data-end="294.759">So these are two fundamentally different paradigms, and they're the two main umbrellas.</span> <span data-start="294.759" data-end="300.61">With paradigms, languages can be characterised under paradigms or can be described as styles</span> <span data-start="300.61" data-end="302.24">of the code you're writing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="302.24" data-end="308.24">You might be writing JavaScript in a more declarative or imperative style.</span> <span data-start="308.24" data-end="317.659">And the two, or rather the main difference between imperative and declarative languages</span> <span data-start="317.659" data-end="323.009">is the presence of control flow in imperative languages which refers to the ability to manipulate</span> <span data-start="323.009" data-end="328.749">the order of execution of statements in a programme, and that happens via, like if statements</span> <span data-start="328.749" data-end="329.919">and for loops.</span> <span data-start="329.919" data-end="341.3">In a literal sense, your computer would read the programme top to bottom, and declarative</span> <span data-start="341.3" data-end="345.94">programming does not have control flow, so any logic or iteration is kind of baked into</span> <span data-start="345.94" data-end="353.76">the actual instructions themes, or what you're telling the computer to do is declarative.</span> <span data-start="353.76" data-end="354.969">Languages that fall under these categories.</span> <span data-start="354.969" data-end="361.55">Imperative are we think of programming languages: JavaScript, Ruby, C++, Python.</span> <span data-start="361.55" data-end="368.31">Generally, if you think of a programming language, it is an imperative language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="368.31" data-end="372.37">Declarative languages are oftentimes domain-specific.</span> <span data-start="372.37" data-end="377.999">Which means they've been to develop within a certain context within a certain domain.</span> <span data-start="377.999" data-end="379.5">What are some domain-specific languages?</span> <span data-start="379.5" data-end="382.05">SQL is one.</span> <span data-start="382.05" data-end="387.729">It is a domain-specific declarative limitation for working with databases.</span> <span data-start="387.729" data-end="388.729">HTML.</span> <span data-start="388.729" data-end="389.729">What?</span> <span data-start="389.729" data-end="390.729">Sure!</span> <span data-start="390.729" data-end="394.639">HTML is a domain-specific language.</span> <span data-start="394.639" data-end="399.84">And, of course, CSS!</span> <span data-start="399.84" data-end="404.77">Okay, sure there are people who would be, "What are you talking about?</span> <span data-start="404.77" data-end="405.77">Just no.</span> <span data-start="405.77" data-end="406.77">CSS is not.</span> <span data-start="406.77" data-end="409.259">Doesn't count."</span> <span data-start="409.259" data-end="413.039">Whether you want to argue CSS was never intended to be something like a programming language</span> <span data-start="413.039" data-end="418.469">or perhaps that the browser can't really count, it just parses, it doesn't do anything else,</span> <span data-start="418.469" data-end="426.15">to that I would say that CSS plus HTML is Turing-complete, which is the ability to solve</span> <span data-start="426.15" data-end="429.449">a problem of a certain complexity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="429.449" data-end="432.96">CSS can do math, which is cool.</span> <span data-start="432.96" data-end="436.3">Functions and variables, CSS also has.</span> <span data-start="436.3" data-end="439.11">Ultimately, I would say why not?</span> <span data-start="439.11" data-end="445.59">So why can't CSS and HTML be part of what we consider programming languages?</span> <span data-start="445.59" data-end="452.49">So, the idea of disqualifying HTML and CSS leads to disqualifying all of declarative</span> <span data-start="452.49" data-end="456.229">languages, so I think that discrepancy comes into play when people are misinterpreting</span> <span data-start="456.229" data-end="458.65">what comparative versus declarative is.</span> <span data-start="458.65" data-end="462.29">Further, the web at large is declarative in nature.</span> <span data-start="462.29" data-end="468.279">If we had to describe in our programmes how a computer is supposed to, or how a browser</span> <span data-start="468.279" data-end="473.349">is supposed to open a connection to a server, that would be intense and totally inaccessible,</span> <span data-start="473.349" data-end="476.689">so the power of declarative programming is huge especially when it comes to APIs and</span> <span data-start="476.689" data-end="479.659">anything we do on the web.</span> <span data-start="479.659" data-end="489.009">So, hear this loud and clear: CSS is a domain-specific declarative programming language 100 per cent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="489.009" data-end="495.219">And another one: we as CSS developers programme the layout of web pages.</span> <span data-start="495.219" data-end="497.81">I will give that another 100 per cent.</span> <span data-start="497.81" data-end="503.15">Given to what I do as a CSS developer as programmer is getting used to that.</span> <span data-start="503.15" data-end="510.36">As I get more and more used to how a browser works, the code can totally count as programming.</span> <span data-start="510.36" data-end="518.68">Now we've established, got that out of the way, let's talk about algorithms.</span> <span data-start="518.68" data-end="520">Algorithms 101.</span> <span data-start="520" data-end="521">Yay!</span> <span data-start="521" data-end="522">Let's have another definition.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="522" data-end="527.65">It is a well-defined computational procedure that takes input and produces output.</span> <span data-start="527.65" data-end="533.21">This is a definition taken from the introduction to algorithms, which is one of these large</span> <span data-start="533.21" data-end="538.71">text books I a signed for computer science courses, dense, informative, maybe not a great</span> <span data-start="538.71" data-end="542.59">intro, but hopefully this will be.</span> <span data-start="542.59" data-end="545.35">Let's use this framework to talk about algorithms.</span> <span data-start="545.35" data-end="548.15">We have inputs.</span> <span data-start="548.15" data-end="553.17">Unsorted list, and we have outputs — maybe a sorted list.</span> <span data-start="553.17" data-end="556.31">What is the algorithm in between there?</span> <span data-start="556.31" data-end="561.21">Well, sorting is certainly a solved problem in computer science.</span> <span data-start="561.21" data-end="565.84">We've lots of sorting algorithms — bubble sort is one.</span> <span data-start="565.84" data-end="567.66">A great name.</span> <span data-start="567.66" data-end="570.68">Not the most performant of sorting algorithms, but it is the excellent.</span> <span data-start="570.68" data-end="571.76">Selection sort.</span> <span data-start="571.76" data-end="574.74">We also have merge sort.</span> <span data-start="574.74" data-end="577.34">And quick sort.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="577.34" data-end="581.49">Let's take a look at implementation of one of these to kind of take a look at what an</span> <span data-start="581.49" data-end="582.49">algorithm is under the hood.</span> <span data-start="582.49" data-end="588.09">So, when I — bubble sort, this is what a sorting algorithm looks like if anybody has ever seen</span> <span data-start="588.09" data-end="589.09">one.</span> <span data-start="589.09" data-end="590.25">Let's read for a moment.</span> <span data-start="590.25" data-end="594.6">Wonderful bubble sort in all of its glory.</span> <span data-start="594.6" data-end="597.12">This is imperative JavaScript here.</span> <span data-start="597.12" data-end="600.24">We're telling the computer how to sort.</span> <span data-start="600.24" data-end="604.52">We're giving it step by step instructions to be read top down and the control flow is</span> <span data-start="604.52" data-end="607.12">there so we're jumping back up to certain statements where necessary.</span> <span data-start="607.12" data-end="614.19">It's  this word "declarative programme", this is</span> <span data-start="614.19" data-end="616.51">all you would see.</span> <span data-start="616.51" data-end="620.32">Back to our framework.</span> <span data-start="620.32" data-end="627.66">How would algorithms, or algorithmic thinking like this, apply to CSS?</span> <span data-start="627.66" data-end="636.58">Let's say we have a stack of elements, and our output would be a row of elements.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="636.58" data-end="643.75">What would be an algorithm we would use in declarative CSS to get there?</span> <span data-start="643.75" data-end="647.25">What would be an algorithm we would use to get there?</span> <span data-start="647.25" data-end="648.87">Display flex — sure, why not?</span> <span data-start="648.87" data-end="650.34">That's totally an algorithm.</span> <span data-start="650.34" data-end="654.89">Or perhaps flow left.</span> <span data-start="654.89" data-end="657.35">Gasp!</span> <span data-start="657.35" data-end="661.08">Let's take a close look at the implementation of this algorithm.</span> <span data-start="661.08" data-end="662.08">Okay.</span> <span data-start="662.08" data-end="666.18">Just like there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="666.18" data-end="667.18">Display flex.</span> <span data-start="667.18" data-end="668.18">That's declarative CSS.</span> <span data-start="668.18" data-end="674.5">I will give us a heart, because that's amazing that we can just — that's display flex.</span> <span data-start="674.5" data-end="679.5">Okay, I did a ton of stuff and I didn't have to write that code, that how.</span> <span data-start="679.5" data-end="681.32">That's the power of declarative programming.</span> <span data-start="681.32" data-end="686.68">It's kind of the dream, I think, with what we do with CSS.</span> <span data-start="686.68" data-end="693.44">So the thing is, there is of course a how to declarative programmes.</span> <span data-start="693.44" data-end="699.65">We write the what, at we need to understand the how to make our code better.</span> <span data-start="699.65" data-end="702.45">Let's have an iceberg metaphor.</span> <span data-start="702.45" data-end="707.37">So, declarative on the top, and imperative on the bottom.</span> <span data-start="707.37" data-end="712.42">When it comes to CSS, the imperative part is going to be our — the declarative part</span> <span data-start="712.42" data-end="718.94">is going to be our iceberg at the top, and the C++ and Rust code that lies within a browser's</span> <span data-start="718.94" data-end="725.1">rendering engine is what we have at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="725.1" data-end="733.23">I was like I want to look at this imperative CSS, what is there?</span> <span data-start="733.23" data-end="734.73">I started taking a look at the cascade.</span> <span data-start="734.73" data-end="738.03">I love the cascade in CSS.</span> <span data-start="738.03" data-end="741.43">Not only is the cascade wonderful but the first thing that shows up when you search</span> <span data-start="741.43" data-end="745.41">algorithms and CSS.</span> <span data-start="745.41" data-end="749.8">It combines property values from different source that is from Mozilla developer network.</span> <span data-start="749.8" data-end="757">If we place this into our algorithms framework, we start with inputs from different sources,</span> <span data-start="757" data-end="760.17">and our outputs.</span> <span data-start="760.17" data-end="772.97">What is the difference in between in we sort by origin, specificity, and the origin specified.</span> <span data-start="772.97" data-end="779.02">The winning value is what it sent to the browser's rendering engine.</span> </p>
