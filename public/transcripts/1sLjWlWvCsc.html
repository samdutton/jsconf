<p><span data-start="28.4" data-end="35.32">(Applause) hi, everybody, I'm very proud of you being here after lunch (Laughing) and</span> <span data-start="35.32" data-end="41.48">thanks for the introduction, Alex. You know you can say live with JavaScript, really\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="41.48" data-end="45.37">you can saver lives with JavaScript, you can, you'll see, this is not necessarily an easy</span> <span data-start="45.37" data-end="53.43">path, we have been doing that for the past 13 months and writing JavaScript offline applications</span> <span data-start="53.43" data-end="60.43">to fight Ebola outbreak, we have made a lot of mistakes and find a lot of challenges and</span> <span data-start="60.43" data-end="65.04">we have learn a loath. I want to share with you the challenges the mistakes and the learningses</span> <span data-start="65.04" data-end="71.88">so maybe it will save you some pain if you work withoffline applications. All right.</span> <span data-start="71.88" data-end="78.92">Ebola, I'm sure you know a lot about Ebola because it's been in the media for the past</span> <span data-start="78.92" data-end="83.72">year and a half. Toking to review the facts that will help you understand how to fight</span> <span data-start="83.72" data-end="88.6">it. So, we don't know much about Ebola, once of the things we don't know is how to cure</span> <span data-start="88.6" data-end="95.64">it T way to treat it nowadays is just to bring people to a medical facility and keep them</span> <span data-start="95.64" data-end="101.96">strong and hydrated and treat the symptoms. So that the body can deal with the virus itself.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="101.96" data-end="111.79">However, Ebola has some good parts in comparison with some other diseases, one is that contagion</span> <span data-start="111.79" data-end="119.07">requires direct contact with body fluids, so it's not air born like a cold. And also,</span> <span data-start="119.07" data-end="123.7">infected people are only contagious after they develop symptoms. Unlike the flu where</span> <span data-start="123.7" data-end="127.94">you are giving it to other people and you don't even know you are sick yet. We also</span> <span data-start="127.94" data-end="136.42">know the incubation period is up to 21 days and the way to fight Ebola is mostly what</span> <span data-start="136.42" data-end="143.59">is called contact tracing. When you find someone that is sick with Ebola, you, of course, first</span> <span data-start="143.59" data-end="150.189">bring them to a hospital, provide them with care, and be careful to keep them isolated</span> <span data-start="150.189" data-end="155.579">from other patients because Ebola is very contagious. But the second thing you do is</span> <span data-start="155.579" data-end="161.639">to find out everybody that has had significant contact with that person in the last days.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="161.639" data-end="168.349">And these people are put are infected with Ebola too. So what you have to do is check</span> <span data-start="168.349" data-end="173.659">on them for 21 days, follow up on them for 21 days and sea if they develop symptoms,</span> <span data-start="173.659" data-end="178.87">if they don't, they are free, if they do, then you have to start the process again,</span> <span data-start="178.87" data-end="183.209">so there are two important parts here for stopping the sickness from spreading, one</span> <span data-start="183.209" data-end="187.65">is like, one is contact tracing, the other one is to find infected people as soon as</span> <span data-start="187.65" data-end="194.739">possible so you can help them and also so you prevent them from infecting other people.</span> <span data-start="194.739" data-end="201.069">For that, this is not so see city in the Ebola countries in west Africa like in Liberia and</span> <span data-start="201.069" data-end="206.93">Guine and Sierra Lee I do not know, at one point there were two many people infected,</span> <span data-start="206.93" data-end="213.15">it was difficult to find them ontop tomb. Apart from contact tracing they set up an</span> <span data-start="213.15" data-end="218.889">emergency Ebola hotline where people can basically call with an Ebola emergency saying that somebody's</span> <span data-start="218.889" data-end="225.529">sick or dead or just asking for information because education is very important here too.</span> <span data-start="225.529" data-end="232.389">Some people didn't know what Ebola or didn't believe it existed. Okay, so, how does JavaScript</span> <span data-start="232.389" data-end="240.389">enter the equation? I work for e‑health Africa, a nigh jeerian based NGO that tries</span> <span data-start="240.389" data-end="247.319">to help vulnerable communities, mostly in West Africa live healthy lives. And part of</span> <span data-start="247.319" data-end="253.859">it has been helping with Ebola outbreak (West Africa) we first went to Nigeria pause rewriting</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.859" data-end="260.9">Nigeria based and things were somehow okay, pretty okay, so we were asked to go to also</span> <span data-start="260.9" data-end="273.37">Sierrea Leon, Liberia, in Nigeria we realized contact tracing was working, the contact tracers</span> <span data-start="273.37" data-end="279.55">that go to visit the contacts at home and they use paper forms, you know how paper forms</span> <span data-start="279.55" data-end="285.52">work. It's slow to enter the information and there's no other checking, paper doesn't complain</span> <span data-start="285.52" data-end="292.4">if you don't fill a mandatory field. And also paper is easy to lose or it can be destroyed</span> <span data-start="292.4" data-end="297.4">like what if it gets wet, for example. Also it travels slow, you have to bring it to the</span> <span data-start="297.4" data-end="301.81">place you want it to go. The place you want it to be was what is called the emergency</span> <span data-start="301.81" data-end="305.979">operation center, there is where they take the information and they decide what to do</span> <span data-start="305.979" data-end="311.379">with it. And they also try to digitalize it you can do Analytics or plan a strategy further.</span> <span data-start="311.379" data-end="319.789">This is also like taking all this paper of\h‑‑ all this paper and put it in an application,</span> <span data-start="319.789" data-end="327.47">also error prone and slow and something we human suck at. However, you can do just a</span> <span data-start="327.47" data-end="332.86">simple application where the contact tracer will select the name of a person they are</span> <span data-start="332.86" data-end="338.639">following up with and they can just fill out the symptoms and as a bonus once you save</span> <span data-start="338.639" data-end="344.72">it, the phone can save the GPS coordinates of the place you are, so you can be sure that</span> <span data-start="344.72" data-end="351.36">the contract tracer actually visited the person. This can synchronize to the at that base and</span> <span data-start="351.36" data-end="357.349">you have the data digital lazed very fast. And we could improvise another tool for the</span> <span data-start="357.349" data-end="363.53">major emergency operation center that allows to have real‑time information about what's</span> <span data-start="363.53" data-end="367.49">happening for example if someone has developed symptoms you can see they're highlighted in</span> <span data-start="367.49" data-end="375.069">red. I also mentioned the call center, for the call center it was even more extreme because</span> <span data-start="375.069" data-end="381.28">they are receiving more information. They were using different things, ranging from</span> <span data-start="381.28" data-end="386.8">paper to excel to some applications they were not happy with. Imagine for example paper,</span> <span data-start="386.8" data-end="391.84">you are receiving all these calls from people that are\h‑‑ and you have to write everything</span> <span data-start="391.84" data-end="397.31">very fast and then the next call comes and you have your paper that is piling up, and</span> <span data-start="397.31" data-end="402.629">then somebody has to go there and have to filter the calls that were actually got or</span> <span data-start="402.629" data-end="408.009">the calls that were just asking for information from the calls that says there is somebody</span> <span data-start="408.009" data-end="413.569">dead at my place and like my son has died and he has been here for two days and somebody</span> <span data-start="413.569" data-end="419.909">has to e puck the corporation because this is in\h‑‑ has to pick up the Corps because</span> <span data-start="419.909" data-end="425.409">it's infections. We created a place where they could enter the information easily. The</span> <span data-start="425.409" data-end="431.28">different teams you see here, the quartine team, ambulance team can just filter the information</span> <span data-start="431.28" data-end="437.349">they want, we can prioritize it for them. And they can the\h‑‑ prioritize it for</span> <span data-start="437.349" data-end="443.9">them () these two applications are pretty simple, but thaw manage to make the process</span> <span data-start="443.9" data-end="451.199">faster with the mobile applications, reduce the response time from twelve hours to almost</span> <span data-start="451.199" data-end="457.33">instantly as instantly as the network connection was working in the call center there was an</span> <span data-start="457.33" data-end="462.02">article the other Jan Day saying all the improvements in the call center have managed to reduce</span> <span data-start="462.02" data-end="468.36">the response time from an average of five days to one day, it was not only the support,</span> <span data-start="468.36" data-end="473.03">there were many other improvements, five days is pretty bad if you're sick and you have</span> <span data-start="473.03" data-end="479.229">to be taken to a hospital. But this is not very complicated this is a bunch of web forms</span> <span data-start="479.229" data-end="487.349">a bunch of API calls, we know how to cowhich, we're web developers, it's a two minute job.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.349" data-end="494.139">We have some constraints that make our live difficult between difficult and a living hell.</span> <span data-start="494.139" data-end="501.49">There's not always internet () sometimes there is, but it's too slow. It's unreliable, one</span> <span data-start="501.49" data-end="507.259">thing we know for sure is our applications have to work offline. Fortunately, we have</span> <span data-start="507.259" data-end="517.779">the help of some awesome piece of technology, couch DB, couch DB is document database that</span> <span data-start="517.779" data-end="525.23">allows you to do map reduce operations also using JavaScript on the data. And has HTTP</span> <span data-start="525.23" data-end="533.88">API and designed with distributed systems in mind. And this part about the HTTP API</span> <span data-start="533.88" data-end="539.57">means that couch DB can be your back end. In our case this is what we did, couch DB</span> <span data-start="539.57" data-end="544.81">is our back end so we don't have to implement this part. The only part missing here is the</span> <span data-start="544.81" data-end="550.59">offline capabilities. But, then we had the help from touch DB, which is also an\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="550.59" data-end="558.52">pouch DB which is an Open Source project which provides you with a compatible database within</span> <span data-start="558.52" data-end="567.66">your browser. We added a little bit of Angular to the mix, and it allowed us to move very</span> <span data-start="567.66" data-end="573.7">fast and be super flexible with the data we were handling. So fast that the first prototype</span> <span data-start="573.7" data-end="578.64">of our contract tracing App was ready in three days, the prototype, and same for the call</span> <span data-start="578.64" data-end="584.53">certain both were in production doing something within a week. The code was somehow crappy</span> <span data-start="584.53" data-end="593.53">and we had to fix it, but, it helped and a few weeks later, Ebola was eradicated from</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="593.53" data-end="599.86">Nigeria and we were asked to go to these other countries where the emergency was much worse))</span> <span data-start="599.86" data-end="607.89">(Eradicated) there were two things that were different in Guiene, and Liberia in comparison</span> <span data-start="607.89" data-end="610.15">with Nigeria, the infrastructure seven worse, so internet is even\h‑‑ infrastructure</span> <span data-start="610.15" data-end="619.04">is even worse and internet is not reliable and the scale of the outbreak was completely</span> <span data-start="619.04" data-end="627.02">different. So we started having some problems. Here you can see the difference between\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="627.02" data-end="632.13">you cannot see even the numbers in Nigeria because they are negligible in commissary</span> <span data-start="632.13" data-end="641.77">son with Sierra Leone in Nigeria there were 20 cases in total Sierra Leone at the worst</span> <span data-start="641.77" data-end="651.75">moment there were 500 new cases a week. 500 new sick people per week. What we were doing</span> <span data-start="651.75" data-end="660.5">at the beginning was simply following the pouch DB tutorial. Just replicates couch DB</span> <span data-start="660.5" data-end="664.25">database in your browser. You have all your data available and you can work as if you</span> <span data-start="664.25" data-end="669.77">were on‑line all the time. But we started noticing that at some point this was not working</span> <span data-start="669.77" data-end="674.54">quite well. First the browser complained, look this is too much space, you are being</span> <span data-start="674.54" data-end="682.69">too greedy. Different browsers have different limits, but, yeah. We sort of ignored this</span> <span data-start="682.69" data-end="687">problem and decide, okay, we'll just support Chrome, that lets us use six percent of the</span> <span data-start="687" data-end="692.77">hard drive, yeah, that didn't work out. The next thing is that the replication started</span> <span data-start="692.77" data-end="698.33">being super slow, but it was ten minutes, 20 minutes, then40 minutes and that was in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="698.33" data-end="707.52">Berlin, in Liberia with more latency and worse internet .. so we were crazy trying to improve</span> <span data-start="707.52" data-end="714.3">this and fix it and then we saw this, which is like Chrome saying, okay, I give up. I</span> <span data-start="714.3" data-end="721">thought it was very funny the first time, oh, I totally own Chrome, but I felt it was</span> <span data-start="721" data-end="729.06">just my development team, no, it was in production, not so funny. What we found is that there</span> <span data-start="729.06" data-end="734.64">was a problem with the replication in couch DB and this is an issue field by one of the</span> <span data-start="734.64" data-end="740.25">couch DB developers for the couch DB guy. There's a lot of information, sorry you may</span> <span data-start="740.25" data-end="745.24">not be able to read it. The summary is 23 you want to replicate ten thousand documents,</span> <span data-start="745.24" data-end="751.38">which is not see much, you can request batches of 500 documents for example, you will assume</span> <span data-start="751.38" data-end="757.8">in 20 requests or more or less, I have my data. However, the way replication works means</span> <span data-start="757.8" data-end="763.58">that you have to do one request per document, so ten thousand documents ten thousand requests.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="763.58" data-end="769.94">If you are using course, as we will, then you have double the number of requests, so</span> <span data-start="769.94" data-end="777.61">ten thousand documents is not so much, 20,000 requests is a lot. Okay, so, problem solved,</span> <span data-start="777.61" data-end="784.35">scaling. You replicate your whole database that can take too much space or too slow it</span> <span data-start="784.35" data-end="790.15">can even crash your browser because of the number of requests. We did a custom solutions</span> <span data-start="790.15" data-end="795.03">to fix the third one, I'm not going to tell you because it's already fixed in couch and</span> <span data-start="795.03" data-end="800.75">pouch DB and they're going to release it very soon, they will do it better than us. But</span> <span data-start="800.75" data-end="807.79">the other two, my advise is think twice about "just" using sink, think twice about what</span> <span data-start="807.79" data-end="814.04">you really need to replicate. Use your domain knowledge. As an example for our contact tracing</span> <span data-start="814.04" data-end="820.3">mobile application, as I said it was just a drop down with names and then you fill up</span> <span data-start="820.3" data-end="825.34">the symptoms right. So we were replicating everything and then we realized, okay, why</span> <span data-start="825.34" data-end="830.88">do we need all these documents? Actually, we don't need any contact after three weeks</span> <span data-start="830.88" data-end="836.68">because then they are not contacts anymore because the incubation period is over. One</span> <span data-start="836.68" data-end="843.74">particular contact tracer only works in one area, not in a whole country. And if people</span> <span data-start="843.74" data-end="848.01">turn out to be infected then they are not followed up anymore, I don't need the contacts</span> <span data-start="848.01" data-end="853.88">there. If you just change from replicating everything to just replicating this subset</span> <span data-start="853.88" data-end="860.32">it's already a hugh improvement. We even went further, okay, but we don't even need all</span> <span data-start="860.32" data-end="865.47">the information about this contact, we just need names and IDs, so just to show you the</span> <span data-start="865.47" data-end="871.42">kind of creative solutions you can make. This is what we did. This is the remote database</span> <span data-start="871.42" data-end="876.12">and this is our document. We were using one document per person, which is not the best</span> <span data-start="876.12" data-end="882.49">choice, I will tell you how to do better afterwards. But, basically we created an index in the</span> <span data-start="882.49" data-end="887.64">remote database with names and IDs and we were requesting\h‑‑ and creating manually</span> <span data-start="887.64" data-end="893.91">a local database, a look up database. And that's all the mobile phone need from the</span> <span data-start="893.91" data-end="899.36">remote database, the rest of the work is you can do offline and the phone can add more</span> <span data-start="899.36" data-end="905.07">follow up information. And it can be synchronized once you have internet. In this case the documents</span> <span data-start="905.07" data-end="910.44">are different in the stored database and remote database so you have to do some custom lodging</span> <span data-start="910.44" data-end="917.79">too, this is due to the fact that our data model is not ideal. will tell you more later.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="917.79" data-end="923.69">In a completely different sample we had the call center where the data set is much bigger</span> <span data-start="923.69" data-end="929.56">so we tried to reduce it. But the smallest at that state was still way too big. And also</span> <span data-start="929.56" data-end="934.28">we were doing something funny here because I told you that with the contact tracing and</span> <span data-start="934.28" data-end="940.05">the task force application we were speeding up the time the paper information will arrive</span> <span data-start="940.05" data-end="946.56">to the operations centers from twelve hours to almost instantly, right. And here in the</span> <span data-start="946.56" data-end="951.41">call center it was different, we had people working side by side, people receiving calls</span> <span data-start="951.41" data-end="957.86">and people sending ambulances for example, and if I take my call and put it on paper</span> <span data-start="957.86" data-end="962.85">I can just hand it to the person sending the ambulance, however the way we were doings</span> <span data-start="962.85" data-end="967.5">it was sending the information all the way to the internet and back. And if there is</span> <span data-start="967.5" data-end="973.24">no internet in two hours, it takes two hours to transfer the information. So that didn't</span> <span data-start="973.24" data-end="980.12">make so much sense. That we released is that we were sort of trying to solve a problem</span> <span data-start="980.12" data-end="986.79">for the sake of solving the problem somehow. We didn't need pouch DB we just needed a database</span> <span data-start="986.79" data-end="993.3">available at all time. What about in every call center you just have a local pouch DP,</span> <span data-start="993.3" data-end="999.67">it's very good at synchronizes between databases when ever there's internet these databases</span> <span data-start="999.67" data-end="1006.51">will synchronize. To have call centers in places with no internet at all because you</span> <span data-start="1006.51" data-end="1012.07">can hire a dedicated telephone line between call centers and then it would be the second</span> <span data-start="1012.07" data-end="1018.98">call center responsibility to synchronize to the Cloud. As colleague of mine says building</span> <span data-start="1018.98" data-end="1027.75">off line applications is basically building distributor systems. So my advise is solve</span> <span data-start="1027.75" data-end="1033.78">real world problems, not software problems and just replicate what you need. The second</span> <span data-start="1033.78" data-end="1039.61">problem you may find when working with off line applications is conflicts between documents.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1039.61" data-end="1047.93">What do I mean? So, again, this is our remote database, our contact tracer forms, imagine</span> <span data-start="1047.93" data-end="1052.67">for simplicity that they can only contact the internet throughout the night. So the</span> <span data-start="1052.67" data-end="1060.31">night of day two they replicate the remote database to the local phones and then day</span> <span data-start="1060.31" data-end="1065.89">three one of the contact tracers go to follow up on the person. At might on day three there's</span> <span data-start="1065.89" data-end="1071.15">no internet for some reason. Day four the other contract tracers go to follow up on</span> <span data-start="1071.15" data-end="1078.17">the person and again at night it synchronize, this time it works. But, what pouch DB says,</span> <span data-start="1078.17" data-end="1084.23">okay guys I have one document and you both have modified and I have no idea which one</span> <span data-start="1084.23" data-end="1090.75">of you is right. So couch DB feels like this this is a conflict and it's for you to the</span> <span data-start="1090.75" data-end="1095.48">side what to do. It's fine, you can do that, you don't need to do that if you have a proper</span> <span data-start="1095.48" data-end="1102.93">data model. What if you have your documents structure in the a way that things are chained</span> <span data-start="1102.93" data-end="1107.85">together are together and things that change separately are separated. For example we have</span> <span data-start="1107.85" data-end="1112.67">a document with personal information and one document per each follow up. This way there's</span> <span data-start="1112.67" data-end="1118.56">never going to be conflicts the phones are just creating new documents, and these documents</span> <span data-start="1118.56" data-end="1126.13">can be synchronized with pouch DB synchronization directly without any customer logic. No logics</span> <span data-start="1126.13" data-end="1133.31">and also this skips a number of revisions. Revisions is the different versions of the</span> <span data-start="1133.31" data-end="1140.92">documents. So less revisions means better replication and less storage. So, chose your</span> <span data-start="1140.92" data-end="1148.96">data model wisely. And the last thing I want to tell you about is data loss, this is like</span> <span data-start="1148.96" data-end="1155.79">the nightmare of every off line application. We found for a different application that</span> <span data-start="1155.79" data-end="1160.9">was reduced people for a vac\h‑‑ that was used for a vaccination trial, we just</span> <span data-start="1160.9" data-end="1167.43">to to collect personal information and take a picture and print a card and they're registered.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1167.43" data-end="1174.49">We realized some people have cards but they're not in our database. The problem we figure</span> <span data-start="1174.49" data-end="1181.29">was that some of the phones were deleting the information before replicating to pouch</span> <span data-start="1181.29" data-end="1189.25">DB and we discovered that index DB that is the storage we use for the browser is temporary</span> <span data-start="1189.25" data-end="1197.24">storage, which is pretty bad. The way it works in Chrome is this is your hard drive and this</span> <span data-start="1197.24" data-end="1203.45">is your available space, and Chrome can use one third of it. And every single application</span> <span data-start="1203.45" data-end="1209.76">within Chrome can use up to 20\hpercent of it. If you have a compute E. 500 Gigas, this</span> <span data-start="1209.76" data-end="1218.38">is quite a lot of space. But if you have a phone, this is maybe not so much. What happens</span> <span data-start="1218.38" data-end="1224.41">when all the space that Chrome has available gets used is that Chrome decides to delete</span> <span data-start="1224.41" data-end="1232.33">the entire data for the least recently used one. So we throughout, okay, but we still</span> <span data-start="1232.33" data-end="1237.21">have a lot of space why would Chrome delete our applicationr? Then we remembered oh, wait</span> <span data-start="1237.21" data-end="1243.93">this application is taking pictures and probably nobody's deleting those pictures, I never</span> <span data-start="1243.93" data-end="1251.15">do. So we are shrinking the space available on disk at some point replication didn't have\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1251.15" data-end="1258.54">was the less recently used and Chrome has to wipe it off. So be careful with this. We</span> <span data-start="1258.54" data-end="1268.67">are investigating whether we can use another storage. So, that was where our some of our</span> <span data-start="1268.67" data-end="1275.37">mistakes. We did more mistakes. We will do more mistakes still. But, it was worth it</span> <span data-start="1275.37" data-end="1281.86">and it was a lot of fun. We discovered most of the mistakes we did was because this was</span> <span data-start="1281.86" data-end="1287.88">state of the art tech so we didn't know so much about it. It was new for us and it was</span> <span data-start="1287.88" data-end="1293.14">new for the internet too, not so many pause in the stack flow, not 50 tutorials about</span> <span data-start="1293.14" data-end="1300.84">how to scale. So, yeah, we learned a lot in the process. What I can recommend you if you</span> <span data-start="1300.84" data-end="1306.41">work with the state of the art technology is get an expert. We were lucky as to have</span> <span data-start="1306.41" data-end="1311.44">one of the core developers of couch DB joining us, he didn't arrive on time to present us</span> <span data-start="1311.44" data-end="1318.61">from doing all the mistakes, but helped us fix it. He's laughing. And also don't forget</span> <span data-start="1318.61" data-end="1323.59">you have the community. All these are Open Source projects and the people who are developing</span> <span data-start="1323.59" data-end="1329.47">them are var passionate about it. And if you have an interesting project and you are pushing</span> <span data-start="1329.47" data-end="1334.559">the limits and if you're nice, of course, remember to be nice, they will probably help</span> <span data-start="1334.559" data-end="1341.83">you. And you can help them, you can fix back if you feel you can do it. Or you can add</span> <span data-start="1341.83" data-end="1347.57">the information on the internet\h‑‑ they don't need to keep repeating the same stuff</span> <span data-start="1347.57" data-end="1358.02">over and over. So I talk a lot about\h‑‑ I talk a lot about deaths and sick people</span> <span data-start="1358.02" data-end="1364.3">and this is pretty sad topic, but I wanted to finish with a little bit brighter note.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1364.3" data-end="1369.17">I'm going to show you the status of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. There is two new</span> <span data-start="1369.17" data-end="1376.1">cases last week in G oarynea which is good compared to what happened before. No new case</span> <span data-start="1376.1" data-end="1385.21">in Sierra Leone there is hope for theout break to end maybe and the Liberia and Nigeria the</span> <span data-start="1385.21" data-end="1400.54">outbreak has ended already. (Applause) I know that our JavaScript application didn't finish</span> <span data-start="1400.54" data-end="1407.79">the outbreak, I like to think that whelped and we saved some lives even if only a few.</span> <span data-start="1407.79" data-end="1413.01">And I can only recommend to work on a project with impact\h‑‑ however we shouldn't stop</span> <span data-start="1413.01" data-end="1419.98">here. Ebola was quite high sickness because it's pretty terrible. But there are many other</span> <span data-start="1419.98" data-end="1425.38">sickness that nobody's caring so much about. We're doing now some work in polio maybe we'll</span> <span data-start="1425.38" data-end="1430.13">deal with measles afterwards there is always a lot of things you can do. You don't have</span> <span data-start="1430.13" data-end="1436.61">to just work in emergencies you can prepare for when the emergencies arrive. As time magazine</span> <span data-start="1436.61" data-end="1436.63">said, when the next epidemic the world must learn the lesson of this one, be better prepared,</span> <span data-start="1436.63" data-end="1436.64">less fearful, run toward the fire and put it out together. Thank you. (Applause).</span> <span data-start="1436.64" data-end="1437.28"Audience member: Thank you, Patricia. That was excellent. I had the great privilege of being able to</span> <span data-start="1437.28" data-end="1438.44">work on this as well. I want was really a very interesting and very cool to do. And</span> <span data-start="1438.44" data-end="1438.58">if you're in the tech scene and you desperately want to disrupt something that's something</span> <span data-start="1438.58" data-end="1438.66">to disrupt. Don't help rich people do laundry, help fight diseases. (Applause).</span> <span data-start="1438.66" data-end="1438.809"Audience member: Okay, we have a few more minutes but not quite enough to have a proper break, so I'll</span> <span data-start="1438.809" data-end="1439.24">just stand here and talk. I'd like to introduce myself, I'm Alex, I'll be your host for the</span> <span data-start="1439.24" data-end="1440.01">afternoon. Yeah, Whoop\h‑‑ thank you. I said it once before\h‑‑ three years</span> <span data-start="1440.01" data-end="1440.35">before was my first conference talk, it was a lot like now just a lot more terrified.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1440.35" data-end="1441.54">What I really want to say is you can stand up here too if you want. If you haven't ever</span> <span data-start="1441.54" data-end="1442.51">done a conference talk before, it's very well within your reach. The Conf is open to speakers</span> <span data-start="1442.51" data-end="1443.79">and topics of just about any purrtion this is literally and figuratively a space for</span> <span data-start="1443.79" data-end="1445.73">a broad range of topics and speakers. Yeah, very much like to encourage you to submit</span> <span data-start="1445.73" data-end="1446.78">to the CFP for next year and speak at other conferences. It's also an interesting opportunity</span> <span data-start="1446.78" data-end="1447.37">for your life and job, you get to meet a lot of people, you get to travel as well. Travel</span> <span data-start="1447.37" data-end="1447.74">the world meet interesting people and lecture them about garbage collection, if you will.</span> <span data-start="1447.74" data-end="1448.19">And, yeah, it's a great way to, you know, further your career a bit. It's very easy</span> <span data-start="1448.19" data-end="1448.62">to convince people that you're an expert on something if you have three video of conference</span> <span data-start="1448.62" data-end="1449.04">talks from all over the world with you talking about that thing. So, yeah. Conferences need</span> <span data-start="1449.04" data-end="1449.44">speakers and speakers come from people like you or literally me, and yeah, so please.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1449.44" data-end="1449.9">If you don't have any experience, go to a local meet up, speak there, and, you know,</span> <span data-start="1449.9" data-end="1450.85">get used to the feeling. And then who knows maybe they'll fly you here and give you a</span> <span data-start="1450.85" data-end="1450.96">great opportunity and great food and then one day you'll be up here too. Yeah. So, oh,</span> <span data-start="1450.96" data-end="1451.08">God that was only two minutes, terrible, I need to talk slower. Any way the next talk</span> <span data-start="1451.08" data-end="1451.19">is also, in a way interested in offline communications but not really networking in a very, very</span> <span data-start="1451.19" data-end="1451.28">interesting way. There'll be extremely funky live demos and\h‑‑ Funky live demos () I</span> <span data-start="1451.28" data-end="1451.41">would like to wait until it's actually quarter to so the people in the other room have time</span> </p>
