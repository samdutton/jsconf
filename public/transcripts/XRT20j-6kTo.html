data-start="24.48" data-end="27.36">JavaScript debugging robots we're young</span> <span data-start="27.36" data-end="29.43">startup we're based out of Switzerland</span> <span data-start="29.43" data-end="31.65">and we came all the way to here to</span> <span data-start="31.65" data-end="33.75">present this you know just before I</span> <span data-start="33.75" data-end="36.059">start a bit of background this is</span> <span data-start="36.059" data-end="38.309">Switzerland right its last in the middle</span> <span data-start="38.309" data-end="40.019">of Europe it's about as big as sorry</span> <span data-start="40.019" data-end="41.519">that maybe even smaller I don't I don't</span> <span data-start="41.519" data-end="44.16">know and there's usually you know this</span> <span data-start="44.16" data-end="46.14">confusion between Sweden and Switzerland</span> <span data-start="46.14" data-end="48.54">so we're from Switzerland Sweden this is</span> <span data-start="48.54" data-end="50.94">that is ikea switzerland it's Swiss</span> <span data-start="50.94" data-end="55.97">cheese right so I'm outback buster so</span> <span data-start="55.97" data-end="59.04">we'll have robots and I I get you know</span> <span data-start="59.04" data-end="60.479">everybody loves robot because you know</span> <span data-start="60.479" data-end="62.33">they do lots of useful things for you</span> <span data-start="62.33" data-end="64.769">for instance you can buy a robot to you</span> <span data-start="64.769" data-end="66.75">no mo your loan if you have a garden you</span> <span data-start="66.75" data-end="69.36">can buy robots to clean your floor or</span> <span data-start="69.36" data-end="72.439">scare your pets depending on you know</span> <span data-start="72.439" data-end="74.909">what you want to do or you can even you</span> <span data-start="74.909" data-end="76.59">know have this really cool flying</span> <span data-start="76.59" data-end="79.049">quadcopters through it so you know all</span> <span data-start="79.049" data-end="80.7">these you know robots they're really</span> <span data-start="80.7" data-end="82.259">nice because they're going to do all the</span> <span data-start="82.259" data-end="83.49">things that you don't really want to do</span> <span data-start="83.49" data-end="85.5">yourself but if there is one thing that</span> <span data-start="85.5" data-end="87.03">you that we want to do is you know</span> <span data-start="87.03" data-end="89.189">programming right if we all love</span> <span data-start="89.189" data-end="90.689">programming especially in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="90.689" data-end="92.13">otherwise you would you know be on the</span> <span data-start="92.13" data-end="94.71">beach or somewhere else you know I don't</span> <span data-start="94.71" data-end="96.119">have to teach you you know how great</span> <span data-start="96.119" data-end="98.399">jazz give is you know you can do a great</span> <span data-start="98.399" data-end="100.59">server-side application with nodejs or</span> <span data-start="100.59" data-end="103.02">program robots now you know they're</span> <span data-start="103.02" data-end="105.03">these cool operating system for mobile</span> <span data-start="105.03" data-end="107.819">you know Firefox OS or Chrome OS for you</span> <span data-start="107.819" data-end="110.609">know with your nice Chromebook so really</span> <span data-start="110.609" data-end="111.749">a lot of things that you can do with</span> <span data-start="111.749" data-end="114.509">with JavaScript what we really don't</span> <span data-start="114.509" data-end="116.789">like is that you know bugs on you know</span> <span data-start="116.789" data-end="118.619">it's a fact of life if you write code</span> <span data-start="118.619" data-end="121.02">you can have you know some of these at</span> <span data-start="121.02" data-end="124.77">some point you know that's not good but</span> <span data-start="124.77" data-end="126.77">this cannot be helped right you know you</span> <span data-start="126.77" data-end="128.67">just you know you're just gonna have to</span> <span data-start="128.67" data-end="130.71">handle them but let me just give you a</span> <span data-start="130.71" data-end="132.87">very simple example this is taken from a</span> <span data-start="132.87" data-end="135.81">website it's a it's a simple form to you</span> <span data-start="135.81" data-end="137.13">know sign up to the mailing list and</span> <span data-start="137.13" data-end="140.52">this is the code that is behind it so</span> <span data-start="140.52" data-end="142.92">it's a you know JavaScript using jquery</span> <span data-start="142.92" data-end="144.81">and the only thing that it does it</span> <span data-start="144.81" data-end="147.66">handles the submit events and then it</span> <span data-start="147.66" data-end="149.52">uses a regular expression to parse the</span> <span data-start="149.52" data-end="150.04">email</span> <span data-start="150.04" data-end="151.959">to make sure it is syntactically valid</span> <span data-start="151.959" data-end="155.62">and if it is then it submits the form so</span> <span data-start="155.62" data-end="157.959">how can you know what can possibly go</span> <span data-start="157.959" data-end="159.909">wrong here right it's only you know less</span> <span data-start="159.909" data-end="162.4">than 20 lines of code right well first</span> <span data-start="162.4" data-end="163.9">you cool you know make a mistake with</span> <span data-start="163.9" data-end="165.849">you know the CSS selector and not get</span> <span data-start="165.849" data-end="167.47">the right value or not get any value at</span> <span data-start="167.47" data-end="170.049">all for doing others then you could make</span> <span data-start="170.049" data-end="171.489">a mistake you know in the regular</span> <span data-start="171.489" data-end="175.48">expression no that never happens but and</span> <span data-start="175.48" data-end="177.489">then if it does happen well that you</span> <span data-start="177.489" data-end="179.26">know this if statement over here is not</span> <span data-start="179.26" data-end="180.79">going to you know do the right thing so</span> <span data-start="180.79" data-end="182.68">you might actually submit something in</span> <span data-start="182.68" data-end="184.989">value to the server or you know prevent</span> <span data-start="184.989" data-end="187.139">somebody from submitting something valid</span> <span data-start="187.139" data-end="190.359">so that's not good and then even if all</span> <span data-start="190.359" data-end="192.01">this code is correct you're going to</span> <span data-start="192.01" data-end="194.98">post a request to a server and then the</span> <span data-start="194.98" data-end="196.93">server is going to do God knows what you</span> <span data-start="196.93" data-end="198.73">know work with the database with some</span> <span data-start="198.73" data-end="200.919">other services and might you know blow</span> <span data-start="200.919" data-end="204.04">up so you might have a pound or two and</span> <span data-start="204.04" data-end="205.51">then of course they're a bunch of you</span> <span data-start="205.51" data-end="207.129">know function calls you know other</span> <span data-start="207.129" data-end="208.569">pieces of code that may also have</span> <span data-start="208.569" data-end="210.909">problems so it's a very simple example</span> <span data-start="210.909" data-end="213.159">there are about 13 lines of useful code</span> <span data-start="213.159" data-end="215.349">in there you know there are about six</span> <span data-start="215.349" data-end="216.819">lines where you could possibly have a</span> <span data-start="216.819" data-end="220.659">problem someday and that's not even</span> <span data-start="220.659" data-end="222.639">counting problems with libraries so that</span> <span data-start="222.639" data-end="225.01">example was using jQuery well I guess</span> <span data-start="225.01" data-end="227.26">jQuery is pretty stable but you know you</span> <span data-start="227.26" data-end="228.819">called upgrade to a newer version of</span> <span data-start="228.819" data-end="230.53">jQuery and all of seven hats you know</span> <span data-start="230.53" data-end="232.959">some unexpected behavior so something</span> <span data-start="232.959" data-end="235.389">will break sooner or later so what can</span> <span data-start="235.389" data-end="237.449">you do to you know make things better</span> <span data-start="237.449" data-end="239.47">well it could use a strongly typed</span> <span data-start="239.47" data-end="242.949">language maybe but you know this example</span> <span data-start="242.949" data-end="245.049">was syntactically valid you know there</span> <span data-start="245.049" data-end="247.03">is no type problems and still you know</span> <span data-start="247.03" data-end="248.47">there are lots of you know places where</span> <span data-start="248.47" data-end="250.659">you could have issues you could use</span> <span data-start="250.659" data-end="253.15">better compilers or you know compilers</span> <span data-start="253.15" data-end="255.909">to begin with but again that example</span> <span data-start="255.909" data-end="257.44">there I mean it wouldn't help right</span> <span data-start="257.44" data-end="258.94">because you know the problem you know</span> <span data-start="258.94" data-end="260.769">with CSS selectors that kind of stuff</span> <span data-start="260.769" data-end="263.47">there is nothing a compiler can do now</span> <span data-start="263.47" data-end="265.24">you can try to implement some very fancy</span> <span data-start="265.24" data-end="268.24">static analysis tool that was suddenly</span> <span data-start="268.24" data-end="270.4">be useful but you know the problem with</span> <span data-start="270.4" data-end="272.56">static analysis is it has to speculate</span> <span data-start="272.56" data-end="274.12">about what your input is going to look</span> <span data-start="274.12" data-end="276.55">like so you know in general it's going</span> <span data-start="276.55" data-end="277.99">to be difficult to prove or disprove</span> <span data-start="277.99" data-end="280.029">that you know something's going to work</span> <span data-start="280.029" data-end="282.4">or not so in the end of your left with</span> <span data-start="282.4" data-end="283.18">testing</span> <span data-start="283.18" data-end="284.889">the only solution you know if you really</span> <span data-start="284.889" data-end="286.15">want to make sure that you know your</span> <span data-start="286.15" data-end="288.88">thing is going to work or time and not</span> <span data-start="288.88" data-end="293.08">break so speaking a little bit about you</span> <span data-start="293.08" data-end="295.36">know testing techniques right so what</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="296.53">are the you know techniques out there</span> <span data-start="296.53" data-end="298.78">well obviously you can test your code</span> <span data-start="298.78" data-end="301.87">manually when it's just you know mailing</span> <span data-start="301.87" data-end="303.639">list signup well that's not too much</span> <span data-start="303.639" data-end="305.5">work you can you can do it yourself but</span> <span data-start="305.5" data-end="307.6">you know in general you have better</span> <span data-start="307.6" data-end="310.21">things to do than keep you know on</span> <span data-start="310.21" data-end="311.979">clicking and typing stuff to see if it</span> <span data-start="311.979" data-end="314.139">works then you can write unit tests</span> <span data-start="314.139" data-end="315.94">which is very useful and you should</span> <span data-start="315.94" data-end="318.07">definitely do that but if not as easy</span> <span data-start="318.07" data-end="319.78">for instance if you have a server or if</span> <span data-start="319.78" data-end="321.37">you have some you know fancy libraries</span> <span data-start="321.37" data-end="323.5">you can have to mark stuff on you know</span> <span data-start="323.5" data-end="326.38">it's not necessarily easy to test that</span> <span data-start="326.38" data-end="328.72">the entire stack and then finally you</span> <span data-start="328.72" data-end="330.22">can write integration tests using</span> <span data-start="330.22" data-end="332.08">selenium or phantom jet and that's</span> <span data-start="332.08" data-end="334">basically the only solution if you want</span> <span data-start="334" data-end="336.039">to test the entire stack and so you</span> <span data-start="336.039" data-end="337.63">would write something like that just you</span> <span data-start="337.63" data-end="339.37">know just wrote the flu a few lines it's</span> <span data-start="339.37" data-end="341.83">relatively easy but the problem is</span> <span data-start="341.83" data-end="343.78">basically forces you to write more codes</span> <span data-start="343.78" data-end="345.97">right so you're testing code and you</span> <span data-start="345.97" data-end="347.71">have to write more code that's basically</span> <span data-start="347.71" data-end="349.659">the testing products that we have</span> <span data-start="349.659" data-end="352">nowadays right so the additional code</span> <span data-start="352" data-end="353.74">that you would not you write in order to</span> <span data-start="353.74" data-end="357.25">test your you know your feature has to</span> <span data-start="357.25" data-end="358.78">be debugged as well and has to be</span> <span data-start="358.78" data-end="361.9">maintained over time as well and so at</span> <span data-start="361.9" data-end="364.06">bug buster our vision is to try to solve</span> <span data-start="364.06" data-end="366.94">this problem using a robot so sorry to</span> <span data-start="366.94" data-end="368.919">disappoint you it's not a physical robot</span> <span data-start="368.919" data-end="370.78">it's a software robot it's just you know</span> <span data-start="370.78" data-end="373.15">piece of software but basically does the</span> <span data-start="373.15" data-end="374.889">same thing as your vacuum cleaner right</span> <span data-start="374.889" data-end="376.72">it goes around your code and tries to</span> <span data-start="376.72" data-end="378.58">find you know the dirty places that's</span> <span data-start="378.58" data-end="382.84">basically so what it does is it explores</span> <span data-start="382.84" data-end="385.81">your HTML and javascript by itself so it</span> <span data-start="385.81" data-end="388.419">basically uses the application and while</span> <span data-start="388.419" data-end="391.389">it does that it detects bugs on top of</span> <span data-start="391.389" data-end="393.909">it we have a very expressive timing</span> <span data-start="393.909" data-end="396.37">insensitive API that enables you to</span> <span data-start="396.37" data-end="399.159">control the robot a little bit a little</span> <span data-start="399.159" data-end="401.83">bit better and the goal with this is to</span> <span data-start="401.83" data-end="404.58">be is to test a lot more with less code</span> <span data-start="404.58" data-end="407.349">so speaking about automatic exploration</span> <span data-start="407.349" data-end="410.83">of code how does it work so it's fairly</span> <span data-start="410.83" data-end="412.57">simple to understand first you know back</span> <span data-start="412.57" data-end="413.38">with you is going to load your</span> <span data-start="413.38" data-end="415.75">application then it's going to supply</span> <span data-start="415.75" data-end="416.8">input first</span> <span data-start="416.8" data-end="419.05">trigger an event somewhere by typing a</span> <span data-start="419.05" data-end="422.05">value or clicking on a button then it's</span> <span data-start="422.05" data-end="423.819">going to analyze the even handler code</span> <span data-start="423.819" data-end="427.36">basically as it is executing and it's</span> <span data-start="427.36" data-end="429.28">going to you know unfold the control</span> <span data-start="429.28" data-end="431.11">flow graph so basically if you have if</span> <span data-start="431.11" data-end="432.699">statements and stuff like that in an</span> <span data-start="432.699" data-end="434.169">event handler it's going to enfold that</span> <span data-start="434.169" data-end="435.55">and it's going to figure out that there</span> <span data-start="435.55" data-end="438.28">are various sides you know of these if</span> <span data-start="438.28" data-end="440.71">statements and then it's going to try to</span> <span data-start="440.71" data-end="443.139">generate new input in order to cover the</span> <span data-start="443.139" data-end="444.97">different sides of these if statements</span> <span data-start="444.97" data-end="447.129">and if you can do that then it will go</span> <span data-start="447.129" data-end="449.65">back to step 2 step 2 in order to supply</span> <span data-start="449.65" data-end="452.229">additional input trigger again the same</span> <span data-start="452.229" data-end="455.08">even handler and uncover the other parts</span> <span data-start="455.08" data-end="458.139">of the code so if I continue with my</span> <span data-start="458.139" data-end="462.49">signup example the first thing is going</span> <span data-start="462.49" data-end="463.9">to do is well it will figure out that</span> <span data-start="463.9" data-end="465.43">there is one input field so it's going</span> <span data-start="465.43" data-end="468.069">to type a value in there and a that will</span> <span data-start="468.069" data-end="469.96">not trigger any events so it will just</span> <span data-start="469.96" data-end="472.81">carry on and do something else so what</span> <span data-start="472.81" data-end="474.46">it will do is it will click on the sign</span> <span data-start="474.46" data-end="477.61">up button that will trigger the event</span> <span data-start="477.61" data-end="479.979">handler uncover the first if the first</span> <span data-start="479.979" data-end="483.729">part of this if statement over here what</span> <span data-start="483.729" data-end="485.409">this if statement does is you know it</span> <span data-start="485.409" data-end="488.409">runs this regular expression to test to</span> <span data-start="488.409" data-end="491.31">test the validity of the of the input</span> <span data-start="491.31" data-end="494.199">the input here is a it's not a valid</span> <span data-start="494.199" data-end="496.029">email address it doesn't match the</span> <span data-start="496.029" data-end="499.87">regular expression so it stops there so</span> <span data-start="499.87" data-end="501.819">what it will do it will actually resolve</span> <span data-start="501.819" data-end="503.68">this regular expression to figure out</span> <span data-start="503.68" data-end="505.449">another piece of input that could be</span> <span data-start="505.449" data-end="508.3">typed into this text field instead and</span> <span data-start="508.3" data-end="511.06">so it if it successfully does that then</span> <span data-start="511.06" data-end="513.25">it can type something else in the typing</span> <span data-start="513.25" data-end="515.86">in the text field so in this example it</span> <span data-start="515.86" data-end="517.329">will you know type something that looks</span> <span data-start="517.329" data-end="519.07">random but it's actually not random at</span> <span data-start="519.07" data-end="520.659">all it really matches the regular</span> <span data-start="520.659" data-end="523.18">expression and so it types it again and</span> <span data-start="523.18" data-end="524.92">clicks again on the sign up button and</span> <span data-start="524.92" data-end="527.589">now it has covered the entire code for</span> <span data-start="527.589" data-end="530.199">this even handler so that enables you to</span> <span data-start="530.199" data-end="533.47">get great code coverage and to find you</span> <span data-start="533.47" data-end="535.12">know if there is an exception or if</span> <span data-start="535.12" data-end="536.589">there is you know an assertion or</span> <span data-start="536.589" data-end="538.3">something like that that fires in this</span> <span data-start="538.3" data-end="539.98">piece of code then it will catch it and</span> <span data-start="539.98" data-end="544.48">report it what is this good for several</span> <span data-start="544.48" data-end="545.98">things first you can use that for</span> <span data-start="545.98" data-end="548.29">exploratory testing so this is for</span> <span data-start="548.29" data-end="549.23">instance you know</span> <span data-start="549.23" data-end="552.11">have an application it may be new or</span> <span data-start="552.11" data-end="553.67">maybe you don't know it very well you</span> <span data-start="553.67" data-end="555.2">can you know launch your robot and it</span> <span data-start="555.2" data-end="558.05">let it do you know different things see</span> <span data-start="558.05" data-end="559.85">see what happens and get an assessment</span> <span data-start="559.85" data-end="563.12">of the code quality you can also do use</span> <span data-start="563.12" data-end="565.52">these to do more systematic testing so</span> <span data-start="565.52" data-end="567.74">one problem when people are writing test</span> <span data-start="567.74" data-end="569.69">cases is that you know they have sort of</span> <span data-start="569.69" data-end="571.46">a conception of how the code works so</span> <span data-start="571.46" data-end="572.6">they're going to write the test cases</span> <span data-start="572.6" data-end="575.44">you know by following this sort of</span> <span data-start="575.44" data-end="578.24">mental model that I have on so they may</span> <span data-start="578.24" data-end="582.5">miss you know corner cases by analyzing</span> <span data-start="582.5" data-end="583.85">the source code we're actually able to</span> <span data-start="583.85" data-end="586.61">try and cover as much of the code as</span> <span data-start="586.61" data-end="588.86">possible including the corner cases so</span> <span data-start="588.86" data-end="590.39">you can you can use that to to</span> <span data-start="590.39" data-end="592.76">systematically test you could so it's a</span> <span data-start="592.76" data-end="594.82">very useful for testing large code base</span> <span data-start="594.82" data-end="597.08">you know very often people don't have</span> <span data-start="597.08" data-end="598.79">the time to you know write all the test</span> <span data-start="598.79" data-end="600.77">cases that they will want to write for</span> <span data-start="600.77" data-end="602.66">the code base or maybe the code base</span> <span data-start="602.66" data-end="604.94">moves too quickly so maintaining the</span> <span data-start="604.94" data-end="606.89">test case is difficult so you can use</span> <span data-start="606.89" data-end="609.34">these robots to to tell help you do that</span> <span data-start="609.34" data-end="611.66">finally it's it's a cool tool for</span> <span data-start="611.66" data-end="613.34">continuous testing you can you know put</span> <span data-start="613.34" data-end="615.68">that into your Jenkins or whatever</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="615.68" data-end="619.13">Travis and run the rapid as frequently</span> <span data-start="619.13" data-end="623.24">as you want so I was saying before that</span> <span data-start="623.24" data-end="625.58">we also have an API well just because</span> <span data-start="625.58" data-end="627.92">you know when you run the robot in a</span> <span data-start="627.92" data-end="630.11">optimally exploration mode well it might</span> <span data-start="630.11" data-end="631.34">start doing things that you're not</span> <span data-start="631.34" data-end="634.49">interested about right that doesn't mean</span> <span data-start="634.49" data-end="636.38">it's not interesting but you know my</span> <span data-start="636.38" data-end="639.38">delay you know you for little why</span> <span data-start="639.38" data-end="641.03">because you will have to wait until it</span> <span data-start="641.03" data-end="642.65">gets to the place where you want to test</span> <span data-start="642.65" data-end="645.08">your application so we have an API that</span> <span data-start="645.08" data-end="646.97">we call the connector API that is there</span> <span data-start="646.97" data-end="649.28">to control the robot to direct it and</span> <span data-start="649.28" data-end="651.56">also to leverage automatic exploration</span> <span data-start="651.56" data-end="653.6">and that enables to test functional</span> <span data-start="653.6" data-end="657.29">properties here's an example of how this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="657.29" data-end="659.66">API look looks like it's it's also a</span> <span data-start="659.66" data-end="662.42">JavaScript API so the first few lines</span> <span data-start="662.42" data-end="664.61">just to you know started the test</span> <span data-start="664.61" data-end="666.83">session so you can load the URL and you</span> <span data-start="666.83" data-end="668.9">say you know I want to do the automatic</span> <span data-start="668.9" data-end="671.3">exploration but then it's not because</span> <span data-start="671.3" data-end="673.22">it's not in automat it's an automatic</span> <span data-start="673.22" data-end="674.93">exploration that you cannot direct it so</span> <span data-start="674.93" data-end="676.46">you can actually write a few lines to</span> <span data-start="676.46" data-end="679.19">tell it exactly what to do so allein 8</span> <span data-start="679.19" data-end="681.66">to 11 you can you know click type</span> <span data-start="681.66" data-end="683.43">and click again so this is an example</span> <span data-start="683.43" data-end="686.25">where you do a sign in so if you know to</span> <span data-start="686.25" data-end="687.93">provide a username and a password you</span> <span data-start="687.93" data-end="691.29">can do that very easily you can see here</span> <span data-start="691.29" data-end="693.42">the you know timing insensitive property</span> <span data-start="693.42" data-end="696.96">of this API so if you actually need to</span> <span data-start="696.96" data-end="699.6">click on a menu before you know doing</span> <span data-start="699.6" data-end="702.63">the next the next operation on your</span> <span data-start="702.63" data-end="705.42">application by Buster actually since its</span> <span data-start="705.42" data-end="708.3">you know embedded deep into the into the</span> <span data-start="708.3" data-end="711.36">browser it actually figures out if you</span> <span data-start="711.36" data-end="713.28">know there are Ajax requests or if they</span> <span data-start="713.28" data-end="715.05">have if there are timers and that kind</span> <span data-start="715.05" data-end="716.46">of things and it will wait in between</span> <span data-start="716.46" data-end="720.99">two actions that you're queuing before</span> <span data-start="720.99" data-end="722.73">it executes them so you don't have to</span> <span data-start="722.73" data-end="726.15">explicitly write code between your click</span> <span data-start="726.15" data-end="730.23">and another click to prevent the robot</span> <span data-start="730.23" data-end="733.83">from you know being too fast now that's</span> <span data-start="733.83" data-end="735.96">for the sign in and then you know if you</span> <span data-start="735.96" data-end="738">want to verify that you're actually you</span> <span data-start="738" data-end="739.65">know logged in properly in your</span> <span data-start="739.65" data-end="742.68">application you can use a watcher a</span> <span data-start="742.68" data-end="745.95">watcher is basically an event emitters</span> <span data-start="745.95" data-end="748.11">it that spies on the state of your</span> <span data-start="748.11" data-end="749.91">application and that triggers and even</span> <span data-start="749.91" data-end="752.43">when something specific happens so in</span> <span data-start="752.43" data-end="754.83">this example is when some 11 shows up in</span> <span data-start="754.83" data-end="757.05">the application so that enables you to</span> <span data-start="757.05" data-end="759.66">spy on your application and then you</span> <span data-start="759.66" data-end="761.25">want to encode the fact that you know</span> <span data-start="761.25" data-end="763.41">this test session is going to be</span> <span data-start="763.41" data-end="766.49">successful if you properly logged in on</span> <span data-start="766.49" data-end="769.59">unsuccessful otherwise so for that you</span> <span data-start="769.59" data-end="773.07">can use a goal so a goal is a promise</span> <span data-start="773.07" data-end="775.47">that basically says in this test in this</span> <span data-start="775.47" data-end="779.19">test session the sign-in should work if</span> <span data-start="779.19" data-end="781.89">it's not explicitly fulfilled before the</span> <span data-start="781.89" data-end="783.45">end of the test session then you can</span> <span data-start="783.45" data-end="786.24">have a bug reported but if it is like in</span> <span data-start="786.24" data-end="788.34">this example you know in this watcher if</span> <span data-start="788.34" data-end="790.62">we see the element sign then then we</span> <span data-start="790.62" data-end="792.45">know that we're logged in properly so we</span> <span data-start="792.45" data-end="794.01">can fulfill the goal and you know</span> <span data-start="794.01" data-end="797.1">everybody's happy that's an example of</span> <span data-start="797.1" data-end="800.76">our I of our API in terms of technology</span> <span data-start="800.76" data-end="802.65">we're building all of that inside web</span> <span data-start="802.65" data-end="804.6">kits or we have a heavily customized</span> <span data-start="804.6" data-end="806.28">version of JavaScript code to do an</span> <span data-start="806.28" data-end="808.14">instrumentation of the JavaScript and to</span> <span data-start="808.14" data-end="810.99">figure out all these input values we now</span> <span data-start="810.99" data-end="813.15">have beta version that is online so i</span> <span data-start="813.15" data-end="814.25">encourage you to</span> <span data-start="814.25" data-end="816.92">it's completely free and we'd like to</span> <span data-start="816.92" data-end="818.57">get as much feedback from you guys as</span> <span data-start="818.57" data-end="820.45">possible that's why we're here today and</span> <span data-start="820.45" data-end="823.97">we're also considering porting our</span> <span data-start="823.97" data-end="827.24">technology to v8 in order to provide the</span> <span data-start="827.24" data-end="830.36">same technology for four no Jess so if</span> <span data-start="830.36" data-end="832.01">you think that's interesting let us know</span> <span data-start="832.01" data-end="835.67">that will definitely motivate us so I'm</span> <span data-start="835.67" data-end="837.32">getting near the end of my talk and</span> <span data-start="837.32" data-end="840.05">before I'm before I stop just you know</span> <span data-start="840.05" data-end="843.86">wanted to cry 5 one thing if you're</span> <span data-start="843.86" data-end="845.39">doing test-driven development of</span> <span data-start="845.39" data-end="847.28">behavior driven development if you're</span> <span data-start="847.28" data-end="849.2">writing unit tests or selenium test</span> <span data-start="849.2" data-end="851.54">cases by you know by all means keep</span> <span data-start="851.54" data-end="854.09">doing it and by we're not saying that</span> <span data-start="854.09" data-end="856.97">you should you should stop doing this</span> <span data-start="856.97" data-end="859.16">what we try to achieve here is to</span> <span data-start="859.16" data-end="861.29">provide a way to test more not less so</span> <span data-start="861.29" data-end="863.03">you can use these robots to basically</span> <span data-start="863.03" data-end="866.57">try to cover as much of your code as</span> <span data-start="866.57" data-end="868.4">possible and to complement whatever test</span> <span data-start="868.4" data-end="870.41">cases you already have but if you're</span> <span data-start="870.41" data-end="872.35">reading you know if you're using and</span> <span data-start="872.35" data-end="874.46">development mythology that you know</span> <span data-start="874.46" data-end="875.87">where you write your test cases keep</span> <span data-start="875.87" data-end="877.73">doing this that's the best that's the</span> <span data-start="877.73" data-end="880.52">best thing that you can do all right</span> <span data-start="880.52" data-end="883.55">that completes my talk there are three</span> <span data-start="883.55" data-end="885.86">of us here danielle and avenue and of</span> <span data-start="885.86" data-end="887.57">course myself so if you think this is</span> <span data-start="887.57" data-end="889.339">interesting if you like to see a demo or</span> <span data-start="889.339" data-end="892.13">just want to talk about technology just</span> <span data-start="892.13" data-end="908.96">you know come to us thanks a lot</span> </p>
