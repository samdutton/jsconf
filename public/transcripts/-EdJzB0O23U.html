<p><span data-start="420.72" data-end="425.46">I can enable it on react native so what</span> <span data-start="425.46" data-end="428.76">it does is that is leverage the web pack</span> <span

data-end="441.69">when you change is code I mean the</span> <span data-start="441.69" data-end="443.1">payment screen code</span> <span data-start="443.1" data-end="446.31">the app will update immediately and you</span> <span data-start="446.31" data-end="450.09">you still at the same screen but with</span> <span data-start="450.09" data-end="453.539">the newest code and you don't lose any</span> <span data-start="453.539" data-end="455.729">stay of your app and anything that you</span> <span data-start="455.729" data-end="461.76">input in the form still be there and for</span> <span data-start="461.76" data-end="465.09">me it's a big win because I don't need</span> <span data-start="465.09" data-end="469.5">to do a whole process like login pick up</span> <span data-start="469.5" data-end="471.78">the products and then go to the cart and</span> <span data-start="471.78" data-end="473.88">then checkout fielding the building</span> <span data-start="473.88" data-end="480.11">information to get on the payment screen</span> <span data-start="480.11" data-end="484.229">but they're more so let's say you are</span> <span data-start="484.229" data-end="488.13">feel developer or angular or amber there</span> <span data-start="488.13" data-end="491.07">are tools that help you to make your</span> <span data-start="491.07" data-end="495.44">life easier like future a step tool and</span> <span data-start="495.44" data-end="501.03">inspector angular every circle chair</span> <span data-start="501.03" data-end="504.72">step tool and a lot more each platform</span> <span data-start="504.72" data-end="507.12">and framework this has their own dev</span> <span data-start="507.12" data-end="509.49">tools which have developer is lease to</span> <span data-start="509.49" data-end="511.71">figure out what is the problem and and</span> <span data-start="511.71" data-end="515.339">how to fix it so the next question is</span> <span data-start="515.339" data-end="520.77">are we there yet so I mean when I say</span> <span data-start="520.77" data-end="523.62">that I mean are we happy with our our</span> <span data-start="523.62" data-end="526.8">our current workflow is there anything</span> <span data-start="526.8" data-end="531.39">that we can improve on it so the thing</span> <span data-start="531.39" data-end="533.51">about my workflow again</span> <span data-start="533.51" data-end="536.38">so I start with the mock-up like</span> <span data-start="536.38" data-end="539.029">designer give you a screen and then</span> <span data-start="539.029" data-end="542.3">based on that screen I can make react</span> <span data-start="542.3" data-end="544.61">component react native components based</span> <span data-start="544.61" data-end="546.5">on that mock-up and then I will</span> <span data-start="546.5" data-end="549.26">implement some business logic and then I</span> <span data-start="549.26" data-end="552.649">turn on my hot reload so that whenever I</span> <span data-start="552.649" data-end="555.8">change the UI called or the business</span> <span data-start="555.8" data-end="558.1">logic the app will change accordingly</span> <span data-start="558.1" data-end="564.56">without using state yeah and then when</span> <span data-start="564.56" data-end="567.709">the bug comes with just you chrome dev</span> <span data-start="567.709" data-end="570.26">tools to to figure out how you can fix</span> <span data-start="570.26" data-end="575.199">it and it's been pretty neat right but</span> <span data-start="575.199" data-end="580.97">it's not this is one thing that we can</span> <span data-start="580.97" data-end="584.209">control is data from external services</span> <span data-start="584.209" data-end="589.339">for example response of an API call like</span> <span data-start="589.339" data-end="592.279">when we when you do a to do a pray you</span> <span data-start="592.279" data-end="595.16">want to send a request to the server and</span> <span data-start="595.16" data-end="598.519">then get a respond back and then render</span> <span data-start="598.519" data-end="601.639">whatever the server sent back to you but</span> <span data-start="601.639" data-end="605.69">you do not have the power to to decide</span> <span data-start="605.69" data-end="607.459">what is a response that you want to</span> <span data-start="607.459" data-end="614.69">forget and yeah there's a there's a walk</span> <span data-start="614.69" data-end="618.41">around solution such a we can have coat</span> <span data-start="618.41" data-end="622.519">the the data or we just use the mock</span> <span data-start="622.519" data-end="627.05">server but those require code changes</span> <span data-start="627.05" data-end="630.62">and when you find yourself and ups with</span> <span data-start="630.62" data-end="634.25">you sitting back and forth between the</span> <span data-start="634.25" data-end="642.019">mouse server and the real API but how</span> <span data-start="642.019" data-end="642.829">can we</span> <span data-start="642.829" data-end="646.79">so how can we simulate the very 8 cases</span> <span data-start="646.79" data-end="650.42">like when the user login 5 time we want</span> <span data-start="650.42" data-end="652.25">to show our error message from the</span> <span data-start="652.25" data-end="655.97">server but do we want to just login 5</span> <span data-start="655.97" data-end="659.75">time to just see the error message no I</span> <span data-start="659.75" data-end="666.63">don't so I create a tools</span> <span data-start="666.63" data-end="668.28">actually it's a chrome attention and</span> <span data-start="668.28" data-end="672.78">named it reason here's what it looked</span> <span data-start="672.78" data-end="676.95">like is there the gift I will play it</span> <span data-start="676.95" data-end="679.28">right now but what you are seeing is uh</span> <span data-start="679.28" data-end="682.41">you can see that is the chrome dev tool</span> <span data-start="682.41" data-end="686.7">and the reason up here is a panel beside</span> <span
