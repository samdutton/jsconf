<p><span data-start="18.71" data-end="21.48">so I just wanna kind of start off here</span> <span data-start="21.48" data-end="24.63">with how we take keyboard input so this</span> <span data-start="24.63" data-end="26.189">example is actually from our game engine</span> <span data-start="26.189" data-end="29.369">but it the same concept applies when we</span> <span data-start="29.369" data-end="30.84">do something like hit a left arrow key</span> <span data-start="30.84" data-end="33.36">for holding it down we know that in our</span> <span data-start="33.36" data-end="36.93">iteration of the game loop if there's</span> <span data-start="36.93" data-end="38.16">something pressed like a left arrow</span> <span data-start="38.16" data-end="39.989">we're going to like move a character or</span> <span data-start="39.989" data-end="41.94">we're going to do something because we</span> <span data-start="41.94" data-end="44.07">know the state so outside of the game</span> <span data-start="44.07" data-end="46.41">loop we have events happening events</span> <span data-start="46.41" data-end="49.769">firing such as key presses so we're</span> <span data-start="49.769" data-end="51.54">going to save that state or if there's</span> <span data-start="51.54" data-end="53.309">multiple key presses all of that sort of</span> <span data-start="53.309" data-end="55.32">thing we want abstract so keyboards</span> <span data-start="55.32" data-end="56.61">pretty simple and I'm just going to move</span> <span data-start="56.61" data-end="59.43">on from keyboard mouse is as simple as</span> <span data-start="59.43" data-end="61.53">well but it's a little more involved now</span> <span data-start="61.53" data-end="63.08">that we have touch devices right</span> <span data-start="63.08" data-end="65.76">everyone has a least a phone with a</span> <span data-start="65.76" data-end="67.67">touch device with a touch screen on it</span> <span data-start="67.67" data-end="73.2">and when you have touched devices you</span> <span data-start="73.2" data-end="74.7">could have multiple inputs right you</span> <span data-start="74.7" data-end="76.92">could have multiple points so the</span> <span data-start="76.92" data-end="78.24">easiest thing to do is that if a game</span> <span data-start="78.24" data-end="81.27">you're you have a game that supports a</span> <span data-start="81.27" data-end="83.13">mouse and you're moving things around on</span> <span data-start="83.13" data-end="84.78">the screen you could just grab the first</span> <span data-start="84.78" data-end="87.99">point and again we sort of abstract that</span> <span data-start="87.99" data-end="90.21">in our game engine we take the position</span> <span data-start="90.21" data-end="95.009">in the mouse if it's a it's a touch</span> <span data-start="95.009" data-end="97.38">device will just take the first one and</span> <span data-start="97.38" data-end="98.85">like I said emulate that to mouth so you</span> <span data-start="98.85" data-end="100.32">only have to worry about mouse and</span> <span data-start="100.32" data-end="104.31">that's fine um however there's a lot</span> <span data-start="104.31" data-end="106.679">more things you can do than just moving</span> <span data-start="106.679" data-end="108.06">a single finger on screen so we want to</span> <span data-start="108.06" data-end="110.85">handle that so one of the things that we</span> <span data-start="110.85" data-end="112.649">did with the game engine was we</span> <span data-start="112.649" data-end="114.149">incorporated at a library recently</span> <span data-start="114.149" data-end="116.64">called hammer j/s which is really cool</span> <span data-start="116.64" data-end="118.649">because it it does a lot of the stuff</span> <span data-start="118.649" data-end="119.729">that we didn't want to do there's a lot</span> <span data-start="119.729" data-end="121.109">of math involved in things like pinch</span> <span data-start="121.109" data-end="124.319">zoom and swiping and and all these</span> <span data-start="124.319" data-end="128.64">gestures but again these gestures don't</span> <span data-start="128.64" data-end="131.009">happen the same timing is our game loop</span> <span data-start="131.009" data-end="134.73">so we want to do is is listen for a</span> <span data-start="134.73" data-end="137.25">gesture such as swipe and then put that</span> <span data-start="137.25" data-end="139.26">somewhere that our game loop is going to</span> <span data-start="139.26" data-end="140.85">pick up and maybe deal with and and</span> <span data-start="140.85" data-end="144.15">throw away or whatever but that way we</span> <span data-start="144.15" data-end="145.98">can abstract that it's just a it's an</span> <span data-start="145.98" data-end="148.11">ambi module or pull it in we we build it</span> <span data-start="148.11" data-end="150.45">into the game and we're good so it's the</span> <span data-start="150.45" data-end="152.05">real real quick demo on how that works</span> <span data-start="152.05" data-end="156.52">when we have here's a bunch of isometric</span> <span data-start="156.52" data-end="158.73">zombies if we're moving a mouse around</span> <span data-start="158.73" data-end="161.17">we're told in something on-screen you</span> <span data-start="161.17" data-end="163.12">know every iteration we can go towards a</span> <span data-start="163.12" data-end="165.49">point no but if we want to do a gesture</span> <span data-start="165.49" data-end="168.55">such as a swipe we want to do that once</span> <span data-start="168.55" data-end="170.53">and throw the event way and so this is</span> <span data-start="170.53" data-end="172.72">all this is doing its just swiping and</span> <span data-start="172.72" data-end="175.05">throwing the zombies around the screen</span> <span data-start="175.05" data-end="180.58">okay so cool gestures okay well that's</span> <span data-start="180.58" data-end="183.16">why so we got gestures we got masks we</span> <span data-start="183.16" data-end="186.31">got keyboard that stuff's all cool but</span> <span data-start="186.31" data-end="187.93">gamepads right we want to play with the</span> <span data-start="187.93" data-end="189.79">play game with it with a joystick or a</span> <span data-start="189.79" data-end="194.71">gamepad and this is still prefixed but</span> <span data-start="194.71" data-end="198.01">we can get from the navigator a list of</span> <span data-start="198.01" data-end="200.38">game pads now these actually work really</span> <span data-start="200.38" data-end="203.53">well with in a game loop because we're</span> <span data-start="203.53" data-end="206.92">not we're not sending event data from</span> <span data-start="206.92" data-end="209.68">from the controller we're just modifying</span> <span data-start="209.68" data-end="211.81">well the API is just modifying the state</span> <span data-start="211.81" data-end="213.13">of the controller so when it's plugged</span> <span data-start="213.13" data-end="215.95">in and we grab the first one off of that</span> <span data-start="215.95" data-end="218.8">off that stack refers a player one from</span> <span data-start="218.8" data-end="220.69">all the buttons and things that will</span> <span data-start="220.69" data-end="223.959">look when I did show you they'll will</span> <span data-start="223.959" data-end="226.06">just check the state so I stole this one</span> <span data-start="226.06" data-end="229.72">directly off of HQ and off of html5</span> <span data-start="229.72" data-end="231.55">rocks there's just a generic controller</span> <span data-start="231.55" data-end="240.76">and first demo fail</span> <span data-start="240.77" data-end="243.3">first it will fail this works really</span> <span data-start="243.3" data-end="245.19">well usually until you go in front of</span> <span data-start="245.19" data-end="253.02">everybody and tried to do it Oh wrong</span> <span data-start="253.02" data-end="256.47">sorry okay imagine that there was a</span> <span data-start="256.47" data-end="258.06">picture of a controller here on the</span> <span data-start="258.06" data-end="259.59">screen this isn't really all that big of</span> <span data-start="259.59" data-end="262.74">a deal but all we're doing is we're</span> <span data-start="262.74" data-end="265.65">checking each button state from a one or</span> <span data-start="265.65" data-end="267.75">a zero if it's an analog joystick and</span> <span data-start="267.75" data-end="271.62">we'll get a 0 to 0 1 a floating point or</span> <span data-start="271.62" data-end="275.06">to negative 1 depending on the axis so</span> <span data-start="275.06" data-end="278.88">so that's fine that all that that</span> <span data-start="278.88" data-end="283.65">stuff's all cool but I i call this</span> <span data-start="283.65" data-end="285.9">postmodern game input devices because</span> <span data-start="285.9" data-end="287.19">all that stuff is sort of the current</span> <span data-start="287.19" data-end="288.51">state right i mean the gamepad api is</span> <span data-start="288.51" data-end="290.16">new but that's what we're used to</span> <span data-start="290.16" data-end="292.26">playing games with as those sorts of</span> <span data-start="292.26" data-end="296.93">things so the first one I want to do</span> <span data-start="296.93" data-end="298.77">there's been a few of these demos come</span> <span data-start="298.77" data-end="301.83">out lately is using a phone as a gamepad</span> <span data-start="301.83" data-end="306.81">right go to iTunes or Google Play grab a</span> <span data-start="306.81" data-end="308.97">nap but there is an app for that and</span> <span data-start="308.97" data-end="312.48">it's just called a browser like don't go</span> <span data-start="312.48" data-end="316.14">and install anything so let's see here I</span> <span data-start="316.14" data-end="318.66">gotta time this just right or or you</span> <span data-start="318.66" data-end="320.61">guys can really screw me up because I'm</span> <span data-start="320.61" data-end="327.78">showing a QR code ok also there's a</span> <span data-start="327.78" data-end="329.64">bitly link if you guys really want to</span> <span data-start="329.64" data-end="332.55">mess with me while I'm doing a demo so</span> <span data-start="332.55" data-end="335.49">sort of what if you guys were in Remy's</span> <span data-start="335.49" data-end="337.23">talk earlier he was taking orientation</span> <span data-start="337.23" data-end="339.81">events from a device i'm in this case</span> <span data-start="339.81" data-end="342.47">this is pretty simple box2d stuff and</span> <span data-start="342.47" data-end="345.21">all i'm doing is applying torque to the</span> <span data-start="345.21" data-end="346.92">wheels based on the orientation that i'm</span> <span data-start="346.92" data-end="350.13">headed in also it's really easy to get</span> <span data-start="350.13" data-end="351.39">the thing stuck so why not just omit</span> <span data-start="351.39" data-end="353.85">event like a button to flip the vehicle</span> <span data-start="353.85" data-end="356.46">over now the the reason I had a QR code</span> <span data-start="356.46" data-end="360">and a bitly link was so that i can make</span> <span data-start="360" data-end="361.68">sure to join the same web socket the</span> <span data-start="361.68" data-end="364.41">page goes to a web socket just grab some</span> <span data-start="364.41" data-end="367.14">random ID the phone has to go to that</span> <span data-start="367.14" data-end="369.93">same go to that same web socket so that</span> <span data-start="369.93" data-end="373.43">we got controls so ok cool we've got</span> <span data-start="373.43" data-end="378.09">we've got web sockets phone controller</span> <span data-start="378.09" data-end="380.129">so we're going to need a gamepad we just</span> <span data-start="380.129" data-end="385.65">use our phone okay thank you but you</span> <span data-start="385.65" data-end="387.78">have to use your hands that's like a</span> <span data-start="387.78" data-end="389.969">baby's toy right we don't want to use</span> <span data-start="389.969" data-end="391.319">their hands for this what I want to do</span> <span data-start="391.319" data-end="395.37">we want to maybe use the camera to track</span> <span data-start="395.37" data-end="396.629">our face now I'm not going to deal with</span> <span data-start="396.629" data-end="397.889">this one this was actually pretty cool</span> <span data-start="397.889" data-end="399.84">this is of course if you're a unicorn</span> <span data-start="399.84" data-end="403.68">you're going to catch doughnuts so a</span> <span data-start="403.68" data-end="405.569">company called be real software they did</span> <span data-start="405.569" data-end="409.59">a google hangout app where it's tracking</span> <span data-start="409.59" data-end="412.68">your head and you catch doughnuts in a</span> <span data-start="412.68" data-end="416.789">hangout so this isn't a w3c spec it's</span> <span data-start="416.789" data-end="419.43">just an API I don't know the magic</span> <span data-start="419.43" data-end="420.449">behind it actually but it's pretty</span> <span data-start="420.449" data-end="422.49">straightforward when you're creating a</span> <span data-start="422.49" data-end="425.34">google hangout a google hangout</span> <span data-start="425.34" data-end="427.74">extension we've got events that we can</span> <span data-start="427.74" data-end="430.65">have gun to the track event that that</span> <span data-start="430.65" data-end="432.509">gets passed into this event here that</span> <span data-start="432.509" data-end="434.759">the track event object has all the</span> <span data-start="434.759" data-end="437.039">things that you'd expect like your noses</span> </p>
