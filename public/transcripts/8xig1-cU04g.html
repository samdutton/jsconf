like that</span> <span data-start="101.18" data-end="104.07">so so what would you say rapid</span> <span data-start="104.07" data-end="109.359">prototyping is anybody have a clue</span> <span data-start="109.369" data-end="113.399">thanks captain obvious all right yeah</span> <span data-start="113.399" data-end="116.7">it's fast right for sure so a more sort</span> <span data-start="116.7"

data-end="123.68">define rapid prototyping I will be</span> <span data-start="123.68" data-end="127.17">talking about rapid prototyping tools to</span> <span data-start="127.17" data-end="129.179">use it and then i'll be showing some</span> <span data-start="129.179" data-end="133.29">demos at the end so they're prototypes</span> <span data-start="133.29" data-end="136.62">so if they break no big deal rapid</span> <span data-start="136.62" data-end="138.72">prototyping it's an extension of the</span> <span data-start="138.72" data-end="140.76">design process it's highly iterative</span> <span data-start="140.76" data-end="143.73">highly collaborative it allows you to</span> <span data-start="143.73" data-end="147.39">test earlier for cheap so one of the</span> <span data-start="147.39" data-end="149.67">biggest advantages to rapid prototyping</span> <span data-start="149.67" data-end="153.84">is say you have six weeks to do a</span> <span data-start="153.84" data-end="158.34">project and you have to work with a</span> <span data-start="158.34" data-end="162.45">project manager a biz dev guy a couple</span> <span data-start="162.45" data-end="163.89">of designers and then you've got to</span> <span data-start="163.89" data-end="165.48">implement it of course what happens is</span> <span data-start="165.48" data-end="167.25">five weeks goes by and then you get a</span> <span data-start="167.25" data-end="169.049">week to implement it typically that's</span> <span data-start="169.049" data-end="170.1">what happens at a lot of places</span> <span data-start="170.1" data-end="173.4">unfortunately so JavaScript lousy what</span> <span data-start="173.4" data-end="175.23">i'll be showing is how JavaScript will</span> <span data-start="175.23" data-end="178.38">enable you do that fast and actually be</span> <span data-start="178.38" data-end="180.42">able to work with the designer side by</span> <span data-start="180.42" data-end="182.94">side so there's a reduction or an</span> <span data-start="182.94" data-end="185.19">elimination of design artifacts and what</span> <span data-start="185.19" data-end="186.63">our design artifacts what I mean by that</span> <span data-start="186.63" data-end="190.019">is a designer makes a design emails you</span> <span data-start="190.019" data-end="193.17">of ping or a PSD you get to go implement</span> <span data-start="193.17" data-end="194.64">it and then the designer sends you a</span> <span data-start="194.64" data-end="196.14">revision and you get to go make the</span> <span data-start="196.14" data-end="197.91">changes in back and forth rapid</span> <span data-start="197.91" data-end="200.43">prototype allows you to sit right next</span> <span data-start="200.43" data-end="202.41">to the designer and just be building</span> <span data-start="202.41" data-end="204.92">while they're doing so it's pretty sweet</span> <span data-start="204.92" data-end="208.62">so in a nutshell rapid prototyping is</span> <span data-start="208.62" data-end="212.91">taking a concept or an idea with a very</span> <span data-start="212.91" data-end="215.959">short amount of time with design and</span> <span data-start="215.959" data-end="222.48">development associated with that other</span> <span data-start="222.48" data-end="225.84">words for rapid prototyping research and</span> <span data-start="225.84" data-end="229.23">development and labs groups so there are</span> <span data-start="229.23" data-end="232.65">small companies that have labs groups</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.65" data-end="233.64">R&D group</span> <span data-start="233.64" data-end="237.03">these types of things and a lot of the</span> <span data-start="237.03" data-end="239.069">times you may never even see what these</span> <span data-start="239.069" data-end="240.66">prototypes are in production but that's</span> <span data-start="240.66" data-end="242.88">kind of a concept there's an exploration</span> <span data-start="242.88" data-end="245.31">and discovery phase you just kind of</span> <span data-start="245.31" data-end="246.84">want to see what's available what's out</span> <span data-start="246.84" data-end="251.16">there but labs groups specifically there</span> <span data-start="251.16" data-end="252.78">are some companies that have been able</span> <span data-start="252.78" data-end="255.06">to take the concept of building out</span> <span data-start="255.06" data-end="257.87">prototypes and utilizing them for</span> <span data-start="257.87" data-end="261.48">production ready applications what have</span> <span data-start="261.48" data-end="264.06">you one company that's really good at</span> <span data-start="264.06" data-end="267.81">this is google which this was perfect</span> <span data-start="267.81" data-end="269.4">i'm in the google room so this is</span> <span data-start="269.4" data-end="273.72">awesome they they've actually had they</span> <span data-start="273.72" data-end="275.82">have the i think the twenty percent time</span> <span data-start="275.82" data-end="277.83">so i think one day a week get to kind of</span> <span data-start="277.83" data-end="280.32">build on whatever smart folks then</span> <span data-start="280.32" data-end="286.23">google owns all the IP and so for</span> <span data-start="286.23" data-end="290.31">examples of things that google's created</span> <span data-start="290.31" data-end="297.33">our google news gmail google adsense and</span> <span data-start="297.33" data-end="300.63">orkut now all these are public face</span> <span data-start="300.63" data-end="302.88">saying people mainly know about these</span> <span data-start="302.88" data-end="304.32">these four things and there are other</span> <span data-start="304.32" data-end="305.64">ones but i'm sure there are ones that</span> <span data-start="305.64" data-end="306.75">never hit production or things that</span> <span data-start="306.75" data-end="311.83">they've shut down all together like wave</span> <span data-start="311.84" data-end="315">how the good thing there to deploy here</span> <span data-start="315" data-end="318.06">is rapid prototyping is not just hey i</span> <span data-start="318.06" data-end="319.8">got this crazy idea and i want to use</span> <span data-start="319.8" data-end="323.25">node and CouchDB and whatever else and</span> <span data-start="323.25" data-end="324.479">just slap it together and see what i can</span> <span data-start="324.479" data-end="327.09">do there's actual real business value</span> <span data-start="327.09" data-end="330.33">behind this and that's big when you're</span> <span data-start="330.33" data-end="331.89">talking with clients about the purpose</span> <span data-start="331.89" data-end="334.979">and the concept behind rapid prototyping</span> <span data-start="334.979" data-end="338.039">for example finally I can actually</span> <span data-start="338.039" data-end="340.83">mention this HP is releasing I don't</span> <span data-start="340.83" data-end="342.15">know if anybody's seen it HP has a</span> <span data-start="342.15"

them and they just launched it I</span> <span data-start="353.82" data-end="356.07">think this past week so it's good timing</span> <span data-start="356.07" data-end="358.81">for me but the rapid prototyping work</span> <span data-start="358.81" data-end="360.61">may or may not actually ship you just</span> <span data-start="360.61" data-end="362.47">don't know the point is that there's an</span> <span data-start="362.47" data-end="364.63">exploration that enables you to be able</span> <span data-start="364.63" data-end="365.98">to put this stuff in a production</span> <span data-start="365.98" data-end="367.45">environment and then hopefully be able</span> <span data-start="367.45" data-end="371.35">to ship it however like I've mentioned a</span> <span data-start="371.35" data-end="375.13">lot of the business use cases will</span> <span data-start="375.13" data-end="377.08">actually go unseen and that's why it's</span> <span data-start="377.08" data-end="380.26">called a prototype a prototype again for</span> <span data-start="380.26" data-end="381.639">those you may have never built</span> <span data-start="381.639" data-end="384.22">prototypes they don't have to be</span> <span data-start="384.22" data-end="386.889">production-ready they can be they can be</span> <span data-start="386.889" data-end="391.93">quite I don't know rigid and robust but</span> <span data-start="391.93" data-end="393.729">at the same time they can they can break</span> <span data-start="393.729" data-end="395.83">very easily it's okay one of the things</span> <span data-start="395.83" data-end="397.979">that we also like to do is create a</span> <span data-start="397.979" data-end="401.41">fairly consistent user flow and we're</span> <span data-start="401.41" data-end="403.54">not talking about catching every edge</span> <span data-start="403.54" data-end="405.7">case we may be called the happy path</span> <span data-start="405.7" data-end="407.86">where you just go through these steps</span> <span data-start="407.86" data-end="409.66">and you show the different screens and</span> <span data-start="409.66" data-end="411.58">the interactions and the design and it</span> <span data-start="411.58" data-end="413.919">works and that's what we shoot for with</span> <span data-start="413.919" data-end="416.38">a prototype so like I said Google is</span> <span data-start="416.38" data-end="418.18">doing these types of things there are</span> <span data-start="418.18" data-end="420.1">other companies doing these types of</span> <span data-start="420.1" data-end="421.87">things there's a company in Austin Texas</span> <span data-start="421.87"
