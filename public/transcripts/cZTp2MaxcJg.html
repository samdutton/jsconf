<p><span data-start="118.85" data-end="124.25">The things in the JavaScript are small — we're focused on language features, small syntax</span> <span data-start="124.25" data-end="126.27">and core library.</span> </p>

<section>
<p><span data-start="126.27" data-end="132.06"><span class="speaker">Julia</span>: one thing that I heard is that JavaScript is really a standalone language, used on the</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="136.14">web, but it is really like something you can use anywhere.</span> <span data-start="136.14" data-end="140">And one thing that people can be interested in is what is a standard, actually?</span> <span data-start="140" data-end="141.75">What does that mean?</span> <span data-start="141.75" data-end="151.761"Audience member: Standard is just a document that describes what is — what a certain thing is, what is</span> <span data-start="151.761" data-end="158.68">supposed to happen when you execute some code in the example of a programming language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.68" data-end="164.13">A standard really takes relevance when it corresponds to implementations, when it's</span> <span data-start="164.13" data-end="169.47">a design that everyone agrees on, and that people can actually take advantage of.</span> <span data-start="169.47" data-end="175.17">There are lots of standards that you can find if you search around, and some of them are</span> <span data-start="175.17" data-end="179.66">outdated, and some of them were just fantasy.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="179.66" data-end="184.76">I think that the JavaScript standard that TC39 produced does a really good job of striking</span> <span data-start="184.76" data-end="193.05">a balance between continuing to add new things and also maintaining relevance through certain</span> <span data-start="193.05" data-end="195.64">processes.</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="201.16"Audience member: The term "standard" tends to be overused in a lot of contexts.</span> <span data-start="201.16" data-end="204.65">It's essentially a document that describes the way something should happen.</span> <span data-start="204.65" data-end="209.1">It is not necessarily — it doesn't necessarily describe the way things actually happen, the</span> <span data-start="209.1" data-end="211.65">way the implementers have done it.</span> <span data-start="211.65" data-end="216.879">It is the set-up rules, if you're going to do this, do it like this.</span> <span data-start="216.879" data-end="221.14"Audience member: The other cool thing about JavaScript, having a standard and having a pretty solid</span> <span data-start="221.14" data-end="226">one, is this is unusual among a lot of languages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="226" data-end="231.79">Languages — I hope I'm not inaccurate here — but Ruby and Python do not have the standard,</span> <span data-start="231.79" data-end="233.83">they have the original implementation.</span> <span data-start="233.83" data-end="240">Everyone who wants to have something compatible with those reverse-engineers it.</span> <span data-start="240" data-end="243.95">Maybe this is okay for a server, or a mostly server language, but for something where we</span> <span data-start="243.95" data-end="250.13">have four competing implementations at least in the browser and elsewhere, it is really</span> <span data-start="250.13" data-end="254.1">important to have a central document that says everybody should be working the same</span> <span data-start="254.1" data-end="255.1">way.</span> </p>
</section>

<section>
<p><span data-start="255.1" data-end="260.09"><span class="speaker">Julia</span>: something that is particularly unique about JavaScript's standard is that the standard</span> <span data-start="260.09" data-end="265.54">leads the language, so the C# programming language — I work for Microsoft, I have tonnes</span> <span data-start="265.54" data-end="274.99">of interaction with .NET, they make the standard after they create the programming language,</span> <span data-start="274.99" data-end="280.25">and, in JavaScript, we have the opposite happening: we create the standard and then the engines</span> <span data-start="280.25" data-end="281.51">pick it up and implement it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="281.51" data-end="288.19">So that's a very unusual characteristic that has to do with the nature of the web.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="323.34" data-end="328.53">For me, I am a very average full stack web developer for Microsoft.</span> <span data-start="328.53" data-end="330.56">I work in crisis management.</span> <span data-start="330.56" data-end="334.73">It has nothing to do with language design at all.</span> <span data-start="334.73" data-end="341.15">I'm nowhere near the language design teams at Microsoft, and I maintain Moment.js, the</span> <span data-start="341.15" data-end="342.86">daytime library.</span> <span data-start="342.86" data-end="353.51">What I found Moment exists is because the date functionality in JavaScript is very bad,</span> <span data-start="353.51" data-end="358.95">and I started like running around Microsoft when I first starting working there a year</span> <span data-start="358.95" data-end="362.29">ago, and I was like, "Does anybody care?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.29" data-end="364.699">Is anybody going to fix the date?</span> <span data-start="364.699" data-end="367.33">Still broken!"</span> <span data-start="367.33" data-end="371.33">And nobody — I wouldn't say nobody did — in fact, Brian Charleston's who is Microsoft's</span> <span data-start="371.33" data-end="375.43">representative to TC39, he was like, "I care a lot about that."</span> <span data-start="375.43" data-end="381.56">When we found each other, he was like, "Let's get this done."</span> <span data-start="381.56" data-end="384.86">I had to find a way to get there.</span> <span data-start="384.86" data-end="393.389">The JS Foundation again is a open-source foundation that supports the needs of many of the major</span> <span data-start="393.389" data-end="399.09">open-source libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem, to all of the jQuery is under JS Foundation,</span> <span data-start="399.09" data-end="406.15">Lowe Dash Grunt Webpack, they said if you care so much about this standard, we can send</span> <span data-start="406.15" data-end="408.25">you to go and represent our libraries.</span> <span data-start="408.25" data-end="409.97">That's how I ended up there.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="458.22" data-end="459.889">What is the deal?</span> <span data-start="459.889" data-end="467.93">I hear Firefox has let and const why aren't they in the language?"</span> <span data-start="467.93" data-end="473.729">One area I really got involved in was asynchronous APIs and promises, and there was a push to</span> <span data-start="473.729" data-end="479.4">put these in the web platform somehow either through the DOM APIs or the language.</span> <span data-start="479.4" data-end="483.72">I thought it would work well in the language.</span> <span data-start="483.72" data-end="485.49">There was a meeting in Boston.</span> <span data-start="485.49" data-end="489.39">I took some time off work and got the bus up from New York.</span> <span data-start="489.39" data-end="497.63">I presented my written-up fairly formal spec on how Promises should work in JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="497.63" data-end="500.32">and the committee was like, "This is pretty good.</span> <span data-start="500.32" data-end="502.57">Let's get this into ES6."</span> <span data-start="502.57" data-end="508.72">So that was just the beginning of a long journey and a lot of arguments committee and -</span> <span data-start="508.72" data-end="511.81"Audience member: Many arguments!</span> <span data-start="511.81" data-end="514.27"Audience member: And Promises was certainly not without controversy.</span> <span data-start="514.27" data-end="519.51">I think they've been pretty successful, and after — I stayed involved, I did in — this</span> <span data-start="519.51" data-end="523.73">a lot in my free time, got involved in other web standards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="523.73" data-end="530.76">Google hired me to represent in TC39 and do this full-time.</span> <span data-start="530.76" data-end="532.009">That was my journey.</span> <span data-start="532.009" data-end="533.11"Audience member: That's pretty great.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="594.57" data-end="600.83">In order to advance to the next step, there has to be a certain amount of implementation</span> <span data-start="600.83" data-end="602.77">experience.</span> <span data-start="602.77" data-end="609.08">It advances, the spec needs to reflect what is actually implemented, so that way, when</span> <span data-start="609.08" data-end="614.68">it comes out of the other end, you know it actually matches what users are going to be</span> <span data-start="614.68" data-end="619.37">using out in the world.</span> <span data-start="619.37" data-end="620.37"Audience member: That's somewhat new.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.37" data-end="622.59">ES6 was the speck that led the implementations.</span> <span data-start="622.59" data-end="629.93">Now they are more intent on, which is very healthy, but I can go through this a lot but</span> <span data-start="629.93" data-end="630.93">I won't.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="968.2" data-end="970.07">That came from Tobias.</span> <span data-start="970.07" data-end="975.21"Audience member: I think I can take this.</span> <span data-start="975.21" data-end="983.839">The bind operator is a fairly popular proposal: briefly, the idea combines several ideas into</span> <span data-start="983.839" data-end="985.49">one.</span> <span data-start="985.49" data-end="991.55">You want this method-change syntax so you can define things in another library but use</span> <span data-start="991.55" data-end="996.43">them as if they're methods on an existing library, so in other languages, this might</span> <span data-start="996.43" data-end="1003.18">be called extension methods, or something like that, and this is a pretty great idea</span> <span data-start="1003.18" data-end="1007.76">because then you could define something like low dash but use it as if it were on a native</span> <span data-start="1007.76" data-end="1009.57">array as if they were methods.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1009.57" data-end="1016.24">It also gives you syntactic sugar for binding and extracting methods, and a number of other</span> <span data-start="1016.24" data-end="1017.79">things, and there are variants of this.</span> <span data-start="1017.79" data-end="1022.54">There is a pipeline operator where the bind operator uses this, the pipeline operator</span> <span data-start="1022.54" data-end="1025.79">uses the first argument like low dash.</span> <span data-start="1025.79" data-end="1031.03">The problem that it's this complicated space with a lot of decisions about, "Well, do we</span> <span data-start="1031.03" data-end="1033.54">really want to tie it to this or the first argument?</span> <span data-start="1033.54" data-end="1035.949">Do we really want to tie binding into the story?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1035.949" data-end="1039.709">Or do we really want to make it more general?"</span> <span data-start="1039.709" data-end="1044.28">Every time somebody's tried to pick this up, there's so many people who feel the opposite</span> <span data-start="1044.28" data-end="1046.809">way, largely in the community.</span> <span data-start="1046.809" data-end="1051.86">The committee I think would be open to anything if we had a clear signal from the community,</span> <span data-start="1051.86" data-end="1054.07">in my perspective.</span> <span data-start="1054.07" data-end="1058.3">It has been discouraging trying to get it moving forward.</span> <span data-start="1058.3" data-end="1062.85">The other thing is we just — you know, well, we have had champions, but I think they've</span> <span data-start="1062.85" data-end="1063.85">gotten discouraged.</span> <span data-start="1063.85" data-end="1066.179">I don't know if that's fair in Dan's estimation?</span> <span data-start="1066.179" data-end="1072.015"Audience member: I would just want to phrase, reiterate by saying this is a big opportunity for saying</span> <span data-start="1072.015" data-end="1080.97">this is a big involvement for — opportunity for community involvement and it is a positive.</span> <span data-start="1080.97" data-end="1087.94">The committee is definitely interested in this proposal once we have more of these kind</span> <span data-start="1087.94" data-end="1089.37">of signals.</span> <span data-start="1089.37" data-end="1098.66"Audience member: Standards are that are made without community involvement are not good standards, period.</span> <span data-start="1098.66" data-end="1100.53">[Applause].</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1100.53" data-end="1108.351"><span class="speaker">Julia</span>: that's a very good point, because there is sort of an issue with that how many people</span> <span data-start="1108.351" data-end="1111.29">know about this committee, and they don't know how to get involved with it, and this</span> <span data-start="1111.29" data-end="1114.94">is also an opportunity for us to get more people involved.</span> <span data-start="1114.94" data-end="1121.87">James, I'm actually going to direct this at you because you mentioned modules, and someone</span> <span data-start="1121.87" data-end="1129.08">has asked, "What is the status of ES Interrupt — module interrupt" and it's been raised many</span> <span data-start="1129.08" data-end="1133.34">times, and they're wondering what the status is.</span> <span data-start="1133.34" data-end="1140.05"Audience member: This is an area where the browsers are ahead of Node.</span> <span data-start="1140.05" data-end="1144.1">There's still some variance in the browser and Dominic could speak to that better than</span> <span data-start="1144.1" data-end="1145.169">than I could.</span> <span data-start="1145.169" data-end="1152.34">As far as Node implementation, we're a long way off — until at least a year until the</span> <span data-start="1152.34" data-end="1155.03">community has something to work with.</span> <span data-start="1155.03" data-end="1156.201">We're going to get there.</span> <span data-start="1156.201" data-end="1164.49">There is a lot more issues on the servers than on the Node side, that the browsers just</span> <span data-start="1164.49" data-end="1169.4">don't have to deal with, so it is a lot, it is a very difficult technical problem.</span> <span data-start="1169.4" data-end="1173.44">Once we get there, I think by the time we get there, the browsers will be like, "What</span> <span data-start="1173.44" data-end="1174.9">took you so long?"</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1174.9" data-end="1179.289">We will be able to ensure pretty good interrupt, but, yeah.</span> <span data-start="1179.289" data-end="1185"Audience member: Yeah, from the browser side, we're trying to do as much as we can to iron out the bugs</span> <span data-start="1185" data-end="1190.62">in the underlying infrastructure, so that when Node is able to tackle it, we can say,</span> <span data-start="1190.62" data-end="1193.04">"Okay, it's ready for you."</span> <span data-start="1193.04" data-end="1195.86">Again it's just this multi-year process.</span> <span data-start="1195.86" data-end="1200.79">First we had module syntax and how module for the browser.</span> <span data-start="1200.79" data-end="1203.61">Semantics are bolt-proof until you have them working in two environments.</span> <span data-start="1203.61" data-end="1207.549">It's not a great interface.</span> <span data-start="1207.549" data-end="1210.02">It's tough.</span> <span data-start="1210.02" data-end="1216.64"Audience member: A big challenge here also is that Ecma 262 only defines the semantics for models</span> <span data-start="1216.64" data-end="1218.7">but not for loading.</span> <span data-start="1218.7" data-end="1223.47">There are different constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1223.47" data-end="1228.66">So the browser can't block the main thread while it's loading everything, so you have</span> <span data-start="1228.66" data-end="1233.289">only like this asynchronous load phase before asynchronous execute operation, whereas the</span> <span data-start="1233.289" data-end="1240.46">way Require works is synchronous execution through the whole tree when it's the loading.</span> <span data-start="1240.46" data-end="1247.96">This isn't — we can reconcile this, but it is just — it breaks my brain and many people's</span> <span data-start="1247.96" data-end="1248.96">brains.</span> <span data-start="1248.96" data-end="1254.76">It takes a lot of time to find a way to do it that allows both the code in the browser</span> <span data-start="1254.76" data-end="1256.73">and in Node to run similarly.</span> <span data-start="1256.73" data-end="1261.6">What we want to avoid is a case where you need to start worrying is, is it running in</span> <span data-start="1261.6" data-end="1264.47">Node or in a browser?</span> <span data-start="1264.47" data-end="1267.98"Audience member: I published a couple of articles of this on Medium.</span> </p>
