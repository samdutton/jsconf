data-end="221.47">actually by design</span> <span data-start="221.47" data-end="223.54">this is still kind of beta so it's</span> <span data-start="223.54" data-end="225.1">missing some features but

<span data-start="231.01" data-end="232.93">got a list of names and you add just a</span> <span data-start="232.93" data-end="234.31">name and half-free clear you want to</span> <span

data-start="239.29" data-end="241.12">then on the home page each week it's</span> <span data-start="241.12" data-end="242.53">going to create a queue of people for me</span> <span data-start="242.53" data-end="243.61">to reach out to you know the sort of</span> <span data-start="243.61" data-end="245.2">interspersed set throughout the week and</span> <span data-start="245.2" data-end="247.18">it does it using a variety of pieces of</span> <span data-start="247.18" data-end="249.13">information you know how often I reach</span> <span data-start="249.13" data-end="250.48">out to someone when I last reached out</span> <span data-start="250.48" data-end="252.4">to them and a few other heuristics going</span> <span data-start="252.4" data-end="254.739">into it and so it's time to reach out to</span> <span data-start="254.739" data-end="256.81">someone it gives me a notification that</span> <span data-start="256.81" data-end="259.72">looks like this now if you start looking</span> <span data-start="259.72" data-end="260.83">at this this is actually kind of</span> <span data-start="260.83" data-end="262.36">different than a typical notification</span> <span data-start="262.36" data-end="264.55">even that may not be quite obvious the</span> <span data-start="264.55" data-end="266.05">biggest thing is compared to a calendar</span> <span data-start="266.05" data-end="268.6">there is no snooze or dismiss by design</span> <span data-start="268.6" data-end="271.45">so what I learned with a calendar is the</span> <span data-start="271.45" data-end="273.37">way it interacts with my anxiety and I</span> <span data-start="273.37" data-end="275.41">think a lot of people's anxiety is we</span> <span data-start="275.41" data-end="277.06">get a notification especially a calendar</span> <span data-start="277.06" data-end="278.32">notification and there's this</span> <span data-start="278.32" data-end="280.93">that we have to do it right then it's</span> <span data-start="280.93" data-end="282.64">like you must do this thing at this</span> <span data-start="282.64" data-end="283.96">moment I'm gonna keep bothering you</span> <span data-start="283.96" data-end="284.86">until you do</span> <span data-start="284.86" data-end="287.17">and that really spikes anxiety as it</span> <span data-start="287.17" data-end="288.73">turns out like that is a UI pattern that</span> <span data-start="288.73" data-end="292.12">is bad for anxiety and now if you have a</span> <span data-start="292.12" data-end="293.08">meeting you have to get two at a time</span> <span data-start="293.08" data-end="294.76">that's just the nature of it but I like</span> <span data-start="294.76" data-end="296.05">reaching out to someone it doesn't</span> <span data-start="296.05" data-end="297.52">matter if I do it now versus a half hour</span> <span data-start="297.52" data-end="298.84">from now it's just matters that I reach</span> <span data-start="298.84" data-end="301.78">out to that person so I changed this so</span> <span data-start="301.78" data-end="303.76">that there is no snooze and dismiss and</span> <span data-start="303.76" data-end="306.49">it's kind of an asynchronous UI pattern</span> <span data-start="306.49" data-end="309.37">this pops up for like 15 seconds and</span> <span data-start="309.37" data-end="310.63">then goes away on its own</span> <span data-start="310.63" data-end="312.7">so it's like an auto snooze and that's</span> <span data-start="312.7" data-end="314.38">intentionally a very short period of</span> <span data-start="314.38" data-end="316.15">time so that actually can't respond to</span> <span data-start="316.15" data-end="317.77">it in that period of time the idea is it</span> <span data-start="317.77" data-end="319.87">pops up it gets the idea in my head like</span> <span data-start="319.87" data-end="321.07">oh yeah I need to reach out to this</span> <span data-start="321.07" data-end="322.39">person then goes away and this</span> <span data-start="322.39" data-end="324.16">eventually I'll get around to it you</span> <span data-start="324.16" data-end="325.66">know when I have a few minutes but it's</span> <span data-start="325.66" data-end="327.52">there in my brain already it's kind of</span> <span data-start="327.52" data-end="328.96">taking up space and I remember to do it</span> <span data-start="328.96" data-end="331.06">and so whenever I do reach out to them I</span> <span data-start="331.06" data-end="332.38">actually have to wait for this to pop up</span> <span data-start="332.38" data-end="334.18">again and then that's when I hit respond</span> <span data-start="334.18" data-end="335.83">and then it will move on to the next</span> <span data-start="335.83" data-end="338.41">person sometimes there can be anxiety</span> <span data-start="338.41" data-end="340">around reaching out to a specific person</span> <span data-start="340" data-end="341.65">maybe I have to have a really difficult</span> <span data-start="341.65" data-end="343.27">conversation with them or it's been a</span> <span data-start="343.27" data-end="344.56">long time since I reached out to them</span> <span data-start="344.56" data-end="346.39">and I'm feeling anxious about the fact</span> <span data-start="346.39" data-end="347.92">that I haven't reached out to them so</span> <span data-start="347.92" data-end="349.24">sometimes just saying like okay I'm not</span> <span data-start="349.24" data-end="350.29">gonna do this person right now I'll</span> <span data-start="350.29" data-end="351.67">reach out to someone else first that can</span> <span data-start="351.67" data-end="353.65">kind of help to just like ease the</span> <span data-start="353.65" data-end="355.21">anxiety and feel me it give me a little</span> <span data-start="355.21" data-end="357.4">more prep to do it again so that's how</span> <span data-start="357.4" data-end="358.9">that works you know remix in this</span> <span data-start="358.9" data-end="361">notification pattern has helped a lot</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="362.53">and like this is still beta stage like</span> <span data-start="362.53" data-end="364.92">this is not a particularly good</span> <span data-start="364.92" data-end="367.15">mechanism actually you know it can be a</span> <span data-start="367.15" data-end="369.25">lot better but it's already better than</span> <span data-start="369.25" data-end="371.35">what we have and I don't say this</span> <span data-start="371.35" data-end="372.7">because like I have some insight it I'm</span> <span data-start="372.7" data-end="374.38">actually a pretty bad UI UX designer</span> <span data-start="374.38" data-end="375.43">it's just that I don't think anyone's</span> <span data-start="375.43" data-end="378.34">ever tried to create a UI that works</span> <span data-start="378.34" data-end="380.35">with people's anxiety and and a little</span> <span data-start="380.35" data-end="381.7">bit I've been using this so far it has</span> <span data-start="381.7" data-end="383.11">made a difference so I think there's</span> <span data-start="383.11" data-end="387.01">something to it and so I implemented</span> <span
