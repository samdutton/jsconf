data-start="198.2" data-end="201.2">you want to do in this talk so p5.js is</span> <span data-start="201.2" data-end="203.48">actually an offshoot of a java library</span> <span data-start="203.48" data-end="205.22">called processing which was created at</span> <span data-start="205.22" data-end="208.01">the MIT Media Lab and the intention of</span> </p>

data-start="235.34" data-end="238.55">the same task for example here are three</span> <span data-start="238.55" data-end="240.86">ways to draw the same circle in three</span> <span data-start="240.86" data-end="245.42">different frameworks so p5 fabric and</span> <span data-start="245.42" data-end="247.7">easel all rely on the canvas API and</span> <span data-start="247.7" data-end="250.52">what's similar in all these code</span> <span data-start="250.52" data-end="251.96">examples is that it allows the</span> <span data-start="251.96" data-end="254.57">programmer to draw an ellipse or draw a</span> <span data-start="254.57" data-end="256.85">circle define the horizontal position</span> <span data-start="256.85" data-end="259.489">the vertical position as well as the</span> <span data-start="259.489" data-end="261.92">horizontal or vertical radius and also</span> <span data-start="261.92" data-end="264.8">there's a method to fill this circle</span> <span data-start="264.8" data-end="270.5">with color</span> <span data-start="270.51" data-end="274.35">so in 1996 interview Damien Hirst's</span> <span data-start="274.35" data-end="276.96">let's go back to you this day me and her</span> <span data-start="276.96" data-end="278.79">sort of described his series of spot</span> <span data-start="278.79" data-end="281.1">paintings as a sculpture about infinity</span> <span data-start="281.1" data-end="283.53">and on his website he lists about 90</span> <span data-start="283.53" data-end="287.76">spot paintings red from 1992 to to sorry</span> <span data-start="287.76" data-end="288.72">yeah yeah</span> <span data-start="288.72" data-end="293.61">1992 to 2012 so about 4 per year and</span> <span data-start="293.61" data-end="295.47">we're gonna do many we're gonna drink</span> <span data-start="295.47" data-end="297.63">procedurally generate many many spot</span> <span data-start="297.63" data-end="309.469">paintings in just a couple of minutes</span> <span data-start="309.479" data-end="313.379">one two three four and we just generated</span> <span data-start="313.379" data-end="314.999">four spot paintings in less than a</span> <span data-start="314.999" data-end="318.089">minute so let's see what's happening in</span> <span data-start="318.089" data-end="320.759">their code so p5 requires a setup</span> <span data-start="320.759" data-end="323.4">function and this setup function runs at</span> <span data-start="323.4" data-end="325.979">the beginning of code execution so in</span> <span data-start="325.979" data-end="327.749">this setup function we're creating a</span> <span data-start="327.749" data-end="330.719">canvas element 800 pixels wide 500</span> <span data-start="330.719" data-end="332.909">pixels tall and we're setting the</span> <span data-start="332.909" data-end="334.83">background of our blank canvas to white</span> <span data-start="334.83" data-end="339.3">and then we have no loop this so we have</span> <span data-start="339.3" data-end="341.129">a draw function and this draw function</span> <span data-start="341.129" data-end="343.139">is being passed as a

<span data-start="347.879" data-end="350.099">basically tells p5 to run this block</span> <span data-start="350.099" data-end="352.58">only once and not to keep doing it so</span> <span data-start="352.58" data-end="355.11">here you'll notice two nested for loops</span> <span data-start="355.11" data-end="357.629">the first for loop draws spot paintings</span> <span data-start="357.629" data-end="359.999">across the canvas while the second for</span> <span data-start="359.999" data-end="362.37">loops are the second for loop draw spots</span> <span data-start="362.37" data-end="364.589">down the canvas we have a color function</span> <span data-start="364.589" data-end="367.08">no stroke another and our familiar</span> <span data-start="367.08" data-end="372.33">ellipse function so a color function</span> <span data-start="372.33" data-end="376.469">basically fills the preceding shape that</span> <span data-start="376.469" data-end="377.819">is a shape to find after the color</span> <span data-start="377.819" data-end="383.31">function is called with color so I just</span> <span data-start="383.31" data-end="384.839">demonstrated that javascript is an</span> <span data-start="384.839" data-end="386.699">artistic medium that can do procedural</span> <span data-start="386.699" data-end="388.589">generation and the procedure we're</span> <span data-start="388.589" data-end="392.3">executing is the following three lines</span> <span data-start="392.3" data-end="394.68">now I
