<p><span data-start="64.22" data-end="67.03">I can manipulate that to my advantage so</span> <span data-start="67.03" data-end="70.64">what do you see here this is a game I</span> <span data-start="70.64" data-end="72.35">actually made myself kind of a</span> <span data-start="72.35" data-end="75.56">proof-of-concept thing I made this back</span> <span data-start="75.56" data-end="79.28">when this candy box thing went why were</span> <span data-start="79.28" data-end="81.47">probably you know that game where you</span> <span data-start="81.47" data-end="83.18">get candy and you can eat all the candy</span> <span data-start="83.18" data-end="84.32">and then you get a sword and you get</span> <span data-start="84.32" data-end="86.27">quests and the Frog comes and you can</span> <span data-start="86.27" data-end="88.97">answer all the questions and so what do</span> <span data-start="88.97" data-end="90.32">you have to do here it's a very simple</span> <span data-start="90.32" data-end="92.51">game the goal is to become a millionaire</span> <span data-start="92.51" data-end="94.7">and you have 20 gold and you can mine</span> <span data-start="94.7" data-end="97.94">gold so it's a classic clicker game and</span> <span data-start="97.94" data-end="99.38">it's also an idol game because you can</span> <span data-start="99.38" data-end="102.56">use your goal gold to buy a miner</span> <span data-start="102.56" data-end="104.54">so here's Pete he's just working in the</span> <span data-start="104.54" data-end="107.96">mind and every 5 gold or so he puts his</span> <span data-start="107.96" data-end="110.9">gold into my pocket and he's working and</span> <span data-start="110.9" data-end="112.729">he has an efficiency and I can use my</span> <span data-start="112.729" data-end="114.71">goal to upgrade Pete or I can use my</span> <span data-start="114.71" data-end="115.07">gold</span> <span data-start="115.07" data-end="117.59">- hi another miner so if I don't want to</span> <span data-start="117.59" data-end="120.02">wait and so Peter is has mined all the</span> <span data-start="120.02" data-end="122.72">gold I just click here very rapidly and</span> <span data-start="122.72" data-end="125.57">now I buy a second miner and click again</span> <span data-start="125.57" data-end="127.46">again ok that's a hundred that takes too</span> <span data-start="127.46" data-end="129.53">much time now I'm already bored and I</span> <span data-start="129.53" data-end="132.14">want the game to progress faster so what</span> <span data-start="132.14" data-end="132.53">do I do</span> <span data-start="132.53" data-end="136.01">first thing is I check the sources so</span> <span data-start="136.01" data-end="138.29">there's a JavaScript folder and there's</span> <span data-start="138.29" data-end="141.26">an index.html that's the easiest way to</span> <span data-start="141.26" data-end="144.079">start just go there and check for any</span> <span data-start="144.079" data-end="146.569">scripts so there's one script check</span> <span data-start="146.569" data-end="148.54">loading required yes</span> <span data-start="148.54" data-end="150.939">and data — loading the edges so I might</span> <span data-start="150.939" data-end="160.12">want to check out the fjs not to game.js</span> <span data-start="160.12" data-end="166.03">where's the FJ jeaious asd there's no HS</span> <span data-start="166.03" data-end="169.15">so maybe it's the game J's maybe I don't</span> <span data-start="169.15" data-end="171.549">know my code as well so I checked the</span> <span data-start="171.549" data-end="173.709">code in a browser code and I can set</span> <span data-start="173.709" data-end="175.629">some breakpoints of course that would be</span> <span data-start="175.629" data-end="179.65">the easiest approach or I can check if</span> <span data-start="179.65" data-end="181.9">there's something like access to the</span> <span data-start="181.9" data-end="183.4">window object when a game object to</span> <span data-start="183.4" data-end="186.45">store this is obviously on purpose yeah</span> <span data-start="186.45" data-end="188.799">but the much more easier approaches I</span> <span data-start="188.799" data-end="190.239">know I can click this button to get some</span> <span data-start="190.239" data-end="193.209">gold so why don't I just inspect it and</span> <span data-start="193.209" data-end="195.19">see if it has an ID or it has an ID and</span> <span data-start="195.19" data-end="198.879">just take that and hopefully jQuery is</span> <span data-start="198.879" data-end="202.72">installed and looks like it is I have to</span> <span data-start="202.72" data-end="204.819">code with one hand now that's a little</span> <span data-start="204.819" data-end="208.599">bit difficult like that okay I get it</span> <span data-start="208.599" data-end="213.43">and I can run the click function did it</span> <span data-start="213.43" data-end="213.97">work</span> <span data-start="213.97" data-end="216.48">and it looks like it works okay now the</span> <span data-start="216.48" data-end="221.889">tricky stuff set interval and then I</span> <span data-start="221.889" data-end="225.78">pass in a function and then I take the</span> <span data-start="225.78" data-end="230.41">button like that and and I do click and</span> <span data-start="230.41" data-end="232.48">because I don't want to wait that long</span> <span data-start="232.48" data-end="239.44">ah there's the syntax error I just don't</span> <span data-start="239.44" data-end="241.389">pass any value into the set interval</span> <span data-start="241.389" data-end="243.22">function with Mason on really fast and</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="244.959">now I get all the goals I want and I can</span> <span data-start="244.959" data-end="248.799">buy all the — I need and now I just have</span> <span data-start="248.799" data-end="253.18">to wait okay I actually came depending</span> <span data-start="253.18" data-end="254.889">on my memory on my local machine I can</span> <span data-start="254.889" data-end="258.6">run this couple times more</span> <span data-start="258.6" data-end="260.94">and those increases Madchester and now</span> <span data-start="260.94" data-end="262.98">apparently I got all the minor so now I</span> <span data-start="262.98" data-end="264.66">can work on the efficiency so they are</span> <span data-start="264.66" data-end="267.6">better at mining but still now we would</span> <span data-start="267.6" data-end="269.85">wait like ten minutes to get all them 1</span> <span data-start="269.85" data-end="271.89">million and actually tested it when you</span> <span data-start="271.89" data-end="273.66">only have the — and you don't cheat and</span> <span data-start="273.66" data-end="275.37">you have all the — and no efficiency</span> <span data-start="275.37" data-end="278.31">upgrade it takes like 24 hours for them</span> <span data-start="278.31" data-end="280.05">to mine all the 1 million but that's</span> <span data-start="280.05" data-end="283.8">obviously too much time so what can we</span> <span data-start="283.8" data-end="286.29">do we know we have to become a</span> <span data-start="286.29" data-end="286.74">millionaire</span> <span data-start="286.74" data-end="289.56">and we already check the source and so</span> <span data-start="289.56" data-end="291.33">that oh there's the PETA object in the</span> <span data-start="291.33" data-end="293.99">window so you might want to inspect that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="293.99" data-end="296.91">Pete so it looks like a backbone view</span> <span data-start="296.91" data-end="299.97">because it obviously is and what do I</span> <span data-start="299.97" data-end="301.62">have you have an event lock I don't care</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="303.3">for that I have improvements or whatever</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.3" data-end="304.89">I never saw that actually that's a</span> <span data-start="304.89" data-end="306.87">feature I put in and then put it out</span> <span data-start="306.87" data-end="309.84">again so we don't care for that I have</span> <span data-start="309.84" data-end="312.24">miners which is an area where all my -</span> <span data-start="312.24" data-end="313.62">restored but I don't care for them</span> <span data-start="313.62" data-end="315.72">because they're too slow and their stats</span> <span data-start="315.72" data-end="318.81">Oh instead looks very nice so I have a</span> <span data-start="318.81" data-end="320.91">back size probably the size of the</span> <span data-start="320.91" data-end="322.83">miners and when they put their gold into</span> <span data-start="322.83" data-end="325.2">my storage don't care much for that and</span> </p>
