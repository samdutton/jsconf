<span data-start="1164.81" data-end="1166.79">you expose and then slowly increase the</span> <span data-start="1166.79" data-end="1170.51">exposure if you need overtime testing as</span> <span

data-start="1173.93" data-end="1176.81">a driver so in the start I was using</span> <span data-start="1176.81" data-end="1178.64">simple integration tests you know take a</span> <span

data-start="1182.96" data-end="1186.08">and then i moved to like the NJ units</span> <span data-start="1186.08" data-end="1189.26">clone and units and I'll after a while</span> <span data-start="1189.26" data-end="1192.77">this reality kind of hit me the thing is</span> <span data-start="1192.77" data-end="1195.47">like my testing is not a linear thing</span> <span data-start="1195.47" data-end="1199.04">it's a grid so I have to test against</span> <span data-start="1199.04" data-end="1201.98">notes you're 80 10 whatever the next</span> <span data-start="1201.98" data-end="1204.05">version is and there's like several</span> <span data-start="1204.05" data-end="1205.82">different versions the Mongo each of</span> <span data-start="1205.82"

data-end="1219.37">right so what I did was like at the end</span> <span data-start="1219.37" data-end="1221.2">throw out and units because you didn't</span> <span data-start="1221.2" data-end="1223.39">work anymore and then slowly working on</span> <span data-start="1223.39" data-end="1225.57">like a new test framework just</span> <span data-start="1225.57" data-end="1228.34">specifically for integration testing so</span> <span data-start="1228.34" data-end="1231.46">the main core of the idea is to split</span> <span data-start="1231.46" data-end="1233.53">the configuration of what you're testing</span> <span data-start="1233.53" data-end="1235.87">away from what actually is the test and</span> <span data-start="1235.87" data-end="1240.25">also be able to specify tags for the</span> <span data-start="1240.25" data-end="1241.99">test so that you're able to say this tag</span> <span data-start="1241.99" data-end="1244.99">needs to have the server you know</span> <span data-start="1244.99" data-end="1247.24">support at least version 22 for example</span> <span data-start="1247.24" data-end="1250">and only run it on 122 is pressing so</span> <span data-start="1250" data-end="1251.62">that you can split up your tests and run</span> <span data-start="1251.62" data-end="1253.54">them in the grip right so you want to</span> <span data-start="1253.54" data-end="1255.22">run against multiple things you need to</span> <span data-start="1255.22" data-end="1257.59">be able to write a test with the least</span> <span data-start="1257.59" data-end="1259.09">possible amount of pain but still be</span> <span data-start="1259.09" data-end="1261.82">able to give the runner some sort of</span> <span

data-start="1269.14" data-end="1270.94">other thing was like some things are</span> <span data-start="1270.94" data-end="1273.01">really painful like sample I replica</span> <span data-start="1273.01" data-end="1274.72">said like when you bring down a server</span> <span data-start="1274.72" data-end="1277.419">it takes a while for it to stabilize and</span> <span data-start="1277.419" data-end="1279.37">bring it back up so running a lot of</span> <span data-start="1279.37" data-end="1281.44">tests was incredibly slow all right so</span> <span data-start="1281.44" data-end="1283.39">paralyzing the test was also important</span> <span data-start="1283.39" data-end="1286.12">not paralyzing as in running a multiple</span> <span data-start="1286.12" data-end="1288.22">servers out there just being able to run</span> <span data-start="1288.22" data-end="1289.63">them in parallel using multiple</span> <span data-start="1289.63" data-end="1292.36">processes on on the machine for example</span> <span data-start="1292.36" data-end="1294.79">so that's also an ongoing thing but we</span> <span data-start="1294.79" data-end="1296.65">all know for example I want them as</span> <span data-start="1296.65" data-end="1298.35">painful things over a long period</span> <span data-start="1298.35" data-end="1301.65">project is that your test code grows</span> <span data-start="1301.65" data-end="1304.299">uncontrollably because you never prune</span> <span data-start="1304.299" data-end="1306.22">your tests ever how many here actually</span> <span data-start="1306.22" data-end="1307.87">going back when we factor the tests and</span> <span data-start="1307.87"
