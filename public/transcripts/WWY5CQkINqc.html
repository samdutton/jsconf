<p><span data-start="67.86" data-end="70.83">JavaScript itself and you use the the</span> <span data-start="70.83" data-end="72.78">typical you know like a new date get</span> <span data-start="72.78" data-end="74.49">time so getting the current timestamp</span> <span data-start="74.49" data-end="76.89">and then doing some sort of diff in</span> <span data-start="76.89" data-end="81.06">between two times that's one way to as</span> <span data-start="81.06" data-end="83.7">our to measure performance but the</span> <span data-start="83.7" data-end="88.77">problem is that it's it isn't</span> <span data-start="88.77" data-end="90.479">fine-grained enough that you're</span> <span data-start="90.479" data-end="92.549">measuring at best in a millisecond range</span> <span data-start="92.549" data-end="94.59">but the thing is is that it can still be</span> <span data-start="94.59" data-end="97.71">very useful for some general analysis so</span> <span data-start="97.71" data-end="99.36">one of the things that did is I created</span> <span data-start="99.36" data-end="102.21">a plug-in called a stack profiler for</span> <span data-start="102.21" data-end="104.759">jquery one advantage to jquery is that</span> <span data-start="104.759" data-end="107.909">it has a very flat api that has</span> <span data-start="107.909" data-end="109.649">essentially one namespace and there's</span> <span data-start="109.649" data-end="111.81">tons of methods that exist within it but</span> <span data-start="111.81" data-end="113.88">that makes it very easy to analyze in</span> <span

data-end="120.6">github a homepage and I stuck the</span> <span data-start="120.6" data-end="122.67">profile or inside of it and what it does</span> <span data-start="122.67" data-end="124.59">is it goes through an analyte and it</span> <span data-start="124.59" data-end="128.129">clicks every single a jquery call that</span> <span data-start="128.129" data-end="130.14">occurs within the website so in this</span> <span data-start="130.14" data-end="132.48">case you can see that</span> <span data-start="132.48" data-end="135.84">let me see here there's a number of</span> <span data-start="135.84" data-end="137.129">methods a I called but there's one down</span> <span data-start="137.129" data-end="139.08">there the end called out face box so</span> <span data-start="139.08" data-end="141.239">it's the face box jquery plugin that's</span> <span data-start="141.239" data-end="143.18">getting pulled in and that's taking up</span> <span data-start="143.18" data-end="146.25">17.6 percent of the execution time on</span> <span data-start="146.25" data-end="148.799">page load so simply the fact that they</span> <span data-start="148.799" data-end="150.989">are including facebox slows down their</span> <span data-start="150.989" data-end="154.53">load by almost twenty percent and so</span> <span data-start="154.53" data-end="156.569">this tool is i think is especially</span> <span data-start="156.569" data-end="158.579">interesting since then you can use it to</span> <span data-start="158.579" data-end="160.049">start to dig in and get a better picture</span> <span data-start="160.049" data-end="161.819">of where all the resources are going</span> <span data-start="161.819"

get time analysis now the problem</span> <span data-start="170.579" data-end="174.47">is though is that timers in javascript</span> <span data-start="174.47" data-end="178.29">the reported time is not very accurate I</span> <span data-start="178.29" data-end="179.22">mean if you think about it you're</span> <span data-start="179.22" data-end="181.5">measuring the performance of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="181.5" data-end="183.45">from within JavaScript itself and that</span> <span data-start="183.45" data-end="186.75">is just you know there's so much room</span> <span data-start="186.75" data-end="191.18">there for for bugs to occur and so</span> <span data-start="191.18" data-end="193.59">something that starts to occur is so</span> <span data-start="193.59" data-end="195.18">what we have here let me zoom in a</span> <span data-start="195.18" data-end="198.239">little bit this is on OSX and we have</span> <span data-start="198.239" data-end="201.72">four

time</span> <span data-start="211.319" data-end="213.12">is being reported out here these are</span> <span data-start="213.12" data-end="215.31">report in times of how long each the</span> <span

of result and the compared against</span> <span data-start="236.099" data-end="239.25">what you get on Windows so this is a</span> <span data-start="239.25" data-end="241.65">very similar result or

data-end="446.729">one feature that I added to it was the</span> <span data-start="446.729" data-end="448.979">ability to get profile data now what</span> <span data-start="448.979" data-end="451.32">this means is that in Firebug you get</span> <span data-start="451.32" data-end="453.99">these dumps in these in these little</span> <span data-start="453.99" data-end="456.33">tables so whenever you profile a piece</span> <span data-start="456.33" data-end="458.699">of JavaScript code you end up with this</span> <span data-start="458.699" data-end="460.53">table that you can sort and search</span> <span data-start="460.53" data-end="463.289">through but that isn't very useful in</span> <span data-start="463.289" data-end="464.49">and of itself I mean you could read the</span> <span data-start="464.49" data-end="466.349">results and interpret them but it would</span> <span data-start="466.349" data-end="468.539">be better to be able to programmatically</span> <span data-start="468.539" data-end="471.479">interpret those results so what I did</span> <span data-start="471.479" data-end="473.759">was I added a method called get profile</span> <span data-start="473.759" data-end="476.31">another it takes that table of data and</span> <span data-start="476.31" data-end="479.099">dumps it as a just a JSON data structure</span> <span data-start="479.099" data-end="481.169">and now you can use that structure and</span> <span data-start="481.169" data-end="483.12">so you have things here like iam time</span> <span

data-end="490.05">that you can use that to create other</span> <span data-start="490.05" data-end="493.53">things this case and went through a</span> <span data-start="493.53"

the case of jQuery methods act</span> <span data-start="503.07" data-end="505.05">against a set of elements so in this</span> <span data-start="505.05" data-end="509.159">case add class is acting against 98</span> <span data-start="509.159" data-end="510.69">different elements i created a test page</span> <span data-start="510.69" data-end="514.95">with 98 elements on it and so that way</span> <span data-start="514.95" data-end="517.77">when you call add class it ends up</span> <span data-start="517.77" data-end="521.159">calling 542 functions somewhere in</span> <span data-start="521.159" data-end="524.67">either in jquery or elsewhere and so</span> <span data-start="524.67" data-end="528.66">that means that for every single element</span> <span data-start="528.66"

function calls</span> <span data-start="533.279" data-end="538.249">so this call it sort of a big o notation</span> <span data-start="538.249" data-end="540.92">going back to computer science and that</span> <span data-start="540.92" data-end="544.23">for every single time you are performing</span> <span data-start="544.23" data-end="547.199">action how many you know at what rate</span> <span data-start="547.199" data-end="550.47">does it um a rape at what rate doesn't</span> <span data-start="550.47" data-end="553.949">scale so 6n isn't that bad it could</span> <span data-start="553.949" data-end="555.87">definitely be improved I would say so</span> <span data-start="555.87" data-end="557.37">because six functions for every single</span> <span data-start="557.37"

data-end="564.42">method and that is 2n plus N squared and</span> <span data-start="564.42" data-end="567.029">that is not good at all so that means</span> <span data-start="567.029"

data-end="578.279">is that that is something that did not</span> <span data-start="578.279" data-end="581.009">show up in my normal profiling when you</span> <span data-start="581.009" data-end="582.149">look at normal profiling you're like</span> <span data-start="582.149" data-end="583.709">okay the time seems pretty reasonable</span> <span data-start="583.709" data-end="586.11">you know it doesn't seem you know that</span> <span data-start="586.11" data-end="589.019">slow but once you you pull it out in</span> <span data-start="589.019" data-end="590.759">this way it becomes very obvious where</span> <span data-start="590.759" data-end="594.48">the problem is so in this case I went</span> <span data-start="594.48" data-end="595.8">through and started to reduce complexity</span> <span data-start="595.8" data-end="597.629">so I knew right away that remove had to</span> <span data-start="597.629" data-end="600.12">be improved so I've worked to improve</span> <span data-start="600.12" data-end="602.61">remove and as it turned out empty use</span> <span data-start="602.61" data-end="607.8">remove and HTML used empty so whenever I</span> <span data-start="607.8" data-end="609.899">ended the improvement in this case i</span> <span data-start="609.899" data-end="613.29">went from N squared 2 just 3 n 4 remove</span> <span data-start="613.29" data-end="615.6">method all these other methods benefited</span> <span data-start="615.6" data-end="617.069">and they started the scale much much</span> <span data-start="617.069" data-end="618.66">better and they perform much better and</span> <span data-start="618.66" data-end="621.269">so in this case these are improvements</span> <span data-start="621.269" data-end="622.769">that are becoming in the next version of</span> <span data-start="622.769" data-end="624.959">jQuery so I think this is important</span> <span data-start="624.959" data-end="627.3">because nowhere in these results do you</span> <span data-start="627.3" data-end="629.97">see time there's no milliseconds being</span> <span data-start="629.97" data-end="632.129">measured and I think this is important</span> <span data-start="632.129" data-end="633.779">because in the case of jQuery a lot of</span> <span data-start="633.779" data-end="636.269">the methods and jQuery are very specific</span> <span data-start="636.269" data-end="637.92">to the jQuery style of coding and they</span> <span data-start="637.92" data-end="639.6">can't really be compared from one</span> <span data-start="639.6" data-end="641.85">framework to another so comparing them</span> <span data-start="641.85" data-end="643.92">would be just Ingenuus and when the fact</span> <span data-start="643.92" data-end="645.569">jquery just needs to be compared to</span> <span data-start="645.569" data-end="648.089">itself in a very real way but i mean</span> <span data-start="648.089" data-end="650.309">this isn't specific to jquery this is I</span> <span data-start="650.309" data-end="652.29">think very a very general problem and</span> <span data-start="652.29" data-end="653.49">that if you want to know how to make</span> <span data-start="653.49" data-end="655.379">your code better you need to see where</span> <span data-start="655.379" data-end="658.439">not only words performing bad but also</span> <span data-start="658.439" data-end="663.179">when it's scaling poorly okay so any</span> <span data-start="663.179" data-end="664.259">questions real quick before I go on and</span> <span data-start="664.259" data-end="671.11">talk about games</span> <span data-start="671.12" data-end="674.94">okay so another thing that I've been</span> <span data-start="674.94" data-end="678.029">interested in lately is constructing</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="678.029" data-end="681.99">JavaScript games and as it turns out I</span> <span data-start="681.99" data-end="685.23">found to be much harder than I</span> <span data-start="685.23" data-end="688.23">anticipated for a number of reasons now</span> <span data-start="688.23" data-end="690.3">I think browser based games are</span> <span data-start="690.3" data-end="694.769">especially interesting because users can</span> <span data-start="694.769" data-end="696.54">all they have to do is type in a URL or</span> <span data-start="696.54" data-end="698.129">click a link and they can begin playing</span> <span data-start="698.129" data-end="701.25">instantly and it makes it really easy to</span> <span data-start="701.25" data-end="703.68">play at work and so lots of people you</span> <span data-start="703.68" data-end="705.269">know they'll be playing games during</span> <span data-start="705.269" data-end="707.009">work and just open it keeping a tab when</span> <span data-start="707.009" data-end="708.42">you know whatever and I think that's</span> <span data-start="708.42" data-end="712.17">great I love casual gaming so one of the</span> <span data-start="712.17" data-end="714.899">big questions is is why not flash you</span> <span data-start="714.899" data-end="717.389">know why because there's so many browser</span> <span data-start="717.389" data-end="718.709">based games that are developed a flash</span> <span data-start="718.709" data-end="721.529">and I think there's a couple reasons one</span> <span data-start="721.529" data-end="723.75">is that the the technology that using</span> <span data-start="723.75" data-end="726.12">javascript is becoming quite quite</span> <span data-start="726.12" data-end="727.74">portable and that not only if you</span> <span data-start="727.74" data-end="729.75">develop it as a browser game you can</span> <span data-start="729.75" data-end="732.269">then make it a desktop game using you</span> <span data-start="732.269" data-end="734.67">know either titanium or air or a</span> <span data-start="734.67" data-end="736.769">technology like that but it can also</span> <span data-start="736.769" data-end="739.05">translate well to mobile devices you</span> <span data-start="739.05" data-end="743.06">know on iphone pre other mobile devices</span> <span data-start="743.06" data-end="745.8">it'll work on the wii it'll also work on</span> <span data-start="745.8" data-end="749.25">a constrained devices like the oil pc so</span> <span data-start="749.25" data-end="751.11">i mean javascript is very very portable</span> <span data-start="751.11" data-end="753.06">while at the same time it's inherently</span> <span data-start="753.06" data-end="756.63">you know it's an open technology so all</span> <span data-start="756.63" data-end="758.189">this you know interest me a lot you know</span> <span data-start="758.189" data-end="763.079">the ultra portability so i think that</span> <span data-start="763.079" data-end="764.85">any game i mean this this isn't</span> <span data-start="764.85" data-end="767.49">necessarily just JavaScript but i think</span> <span data-start="767.49" data-end="770.04">a good browser based game should be a</span> <span data-start="770.04" data-end="773.399">multiplayer and can't be casually</span> <span data-start="773.399" data-end="775.86">cheated it works well everywhere and</span> <span data-start="775.86" data-end="779.43">it's addictive now the one of the the</span> <span data-start="779.43" data-end="780.99">major problems is that you know</span> <span data-start="780.99" data-end="784.319">javascript itself is you know anyone can</span> <span data-start="784.319" data-end="786.899">view this source yeah and it doesn't</span> <span data-start="786.899" data-end="789.24">even have to be in terribly technically</span> <span data-start="789.24" data-end="790.699">competent to be able to view this source</span> <span data-start="790.699" data-end="793.649">and in fact anyone who has Firebug</span> <span data-start="793.649" data-end="795.839">installed just you know go and change</span> <span data-start="795.839" data-end="797.45">score to 1000 and then</span> <span data-start="797.45" data-end="800.21">yes a they won so I mean JavaScript</span> <span data-start="800.21" data-end="805.58">games are just you know hard I said but</span> <span data-start="805.58" data-end="808.66">going back here so the III think</span> <span data-start="808.66" data-end="810.74">multiplayer is important because it</span> <span data-start="810.74" data-end="812.54">helps to make games really addictive and</span> <span data-start="812.54" data-end="815.06">that the people no longer feel like</span> <span data-start="815.06" data-end="816.92">they're alone and they want to keep</span> <span data-start="816.92" data-end="819.44">playing more and more so I break down</span> <span data-start="819.44" data-end="821.18">browser based games in three different</span> <span data-start="821.18" data-end="823.73">styles strategy games intelligence games</span> <span data-start="823.73" data-end="827.66">and accuracy games and a show how they</span> <span data-start="827.66" data-end="830.39">work well in JavaScript or not strategy</span> <span data-start="830.39" data-end="833.72">games they inherently they require</span> <span data-start="833.72" data-end="835.43">strategy then created to think and to</span> <span data-start="835.43" data-end="838.43">plan ahead and in that way it makes it</span> <span data-start="838.43" data-end="840.8">really hard to cheat so even if someone</span> <span data-start="840.8" data-end="842.6">was sitting there you know tinkering</span> <span data-start="842.6" data-end="844.64">with Firebug or writing a bar or</span> <span data-start="844.64" data-end="846.14">something it's really hard to cheat a</span> <span data-start="846.14" data-end="847.73">strategy game since you have to be</span> <span data-start="847.73" data-end="850.19">writing like an AI in order to to beat</span> <span data-start="850.19" data-end="854.45">it and so then son of itself is good I</span> <span data-start="854.45" data-end="856.49">just well there's a couple games here I</span> <span data-start="856.49" data-end="858.56">wanted to point out this is one called</span> <span data-start="858.56" data-end="860.93">war fish it's sort of a risk like clone</span> <span data-start="860.93" data-end="862.61">has a little bit of JavaScript not too</span> <span data-start="862.61" data-end="865.01">much this is other one called now online</span> <span data-start="865.01" data-end="867.5">this one's more of a trading game yet up</span> <span data-start="867.5" data-end="869.63">trading with partners along the nile for</span> <span data-start="869.63" data-end="871.94">resources this one has more JavaScript I</span> <span data-start="871.94" data-end="873.56">think they use prototype and rails</span> <span data-start="873.56" data-end="877.31">remember correctly so both of those are</span> <span data-start="877.31" data-end="879.35">very much strategy games but the thing</span> <span data-start="879.35" data-end="880.76">with sarah g games that they are very</span> <span data-start="880.76" data-end="883.97">much server-side heavy games and that</span> <span data-start="883.97" data-end="886.67">the vast majority of the logic is taking</span> <span data-start="886.67" data-end="889.91">place on the server and so that way it's</span> <span data-start="889.91" data-end="891.68">it's pretty hard to cheat since the only</span> <span data-start="891.68" data-end="893.06">way to cheetah is develop some sort of</span> <span data-start="893.06" data-end="897.14">intelligence to play against it and but</span> <span data-start="897.14" data-end="898.97">at the same time it's not very open you</span> <span data-start="898.97" data-end="900.17">know people can't read it and learn from</span> <span data-start="900.17" data-end="902.21">it and you know try to understand how</span> <span data-start="902.21" data-end="905.12">the game works so the second type of</span> <span data-start="905.12"

data-start="2217.53" data-end="2219.03">been looking at is the concept of</span> <span data-start="2219.03" data-end="2221.88">distributed testing so being able to</span> <span data-start="2221.88" data-end="2224.099">take a test suite and distribute it out</span> <span data-start="2224.099" data-end="2227.609">to a number of computers and have them</span> <span data-start="2227.609" data-end="2228.9">run the tests and then return the</span> <span data-start="2228.9" data-end="2232.44">results so in this way I call this</span> <span data-start="2232.44" data-end="2235.38">project test warm and the structure is</span> <span data-start="2235.38" data-end="2237.66">is relatively simple there's there's the</span> <span data-start="2237.66" data-end="2241.02">core hub server and all the clients come</span> <span data-start="2241.02" data-end="2243.089">they connect to the server they've asked</span> <span data-start="2243.089" data-end="2244.74">for new tests and they run the tests we</span> <span data-start="2244.74" data-end="2248.4">turn the results and one thing I like</span> <span data-start="2248.4" data-end="2249.81">about this in particular is that it can</span> <span data-start="2249.81" data-end="2252.24">even be run in mobile browsers so you</span> <span data-start="2252.24" data-end="2254.79">can load up a mobile device and open it</span> <span data-start="2254.79" data-end="2257.369">there one thing we've been looking at is</span> <span data-start="2257.369" data-end="2259.89">a so for example nokia is using jquery</span> <span data-start="2259.89" data-end="2263.22">and so we were looking at the problem</span> <span data-start="2263.22" data-end="2265.94">you know how do we test against you know</span> <span data-start="2265.94" data-end="2269.07">physical nokia devices well make sure we</span> <span data-start="2269.07" data-end="2270.78">don't want to run in a simulator we want</span> <span data-start="2270.78" data-end="2272.28">to make sure that the code works on an</span> <span data-start="2272.28" data-end="2273.39">actual device because there's always</span> <span data-start="2273.39" data-end="2277.17">weird differences there so that we're</span> <span data-start="2277.17" data-end="2278.58">talking to nokia they're like well we</span> <span data-start="2278.58" data-end="2281.22">have tons of phones i mean we have more</span> <span data-start="2281.22" data-end="2282.66">phones than we could possibly want and</span> <span data-start="2282.66" data-end="2285.18">we're like well that's good so one of</span> <span data-start="2285.18" data-end="2286.53">the things we're going to do now is we</span> <span data-start="2286.53" data-end="2288.599">could just take like 10 phones connect</span> <span data-start="2288.599" data-end="2291.119">them all to test warm and have them all</span> <span data-start="2291.119" data-end="2292.83">just wanting the test suites that we can</span> <span data-start="2292.83" data-end="2294.57">push to them so this way that someone</span> <span data-start="2294.57" data-end="2295.8">doesn't have to sit there and physically</span> <span data-start="2295.8" data-end="2297.39">fiddle with the device and load the test</span> <span data-start="2297.39" data-end="2298.859">suite or whatever able to this all</span> <span data-start="2298.859" data-end="2302.339">happen automatically assume that if we</span> <span data-start="2302.339" data-end="2303.39">were really rich we'd have a whole bunch</span> <span data-start="2303.39" data-end="2304.98">of iPhones as well we can just run it I</span> <span data-start="2304.98" data-end="2305.4">guess</span> <span data-start="2305.4" data-end="2307.41">but for now maybe there's a simulator</span> <span data-start="2307.41" data-end="2310.26">will work so this is sort of the basic</span> <span data-start="2310.26" data-end="2312.45">structure and that you have the the core</span> <span data-start="2312.45" data-end="2314.94">test forum server the whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="2314.94" data-end="2316.38">clients connect to it from a whole bunch</span> <span data-start="2316.38" data-end="2318.12">of different browsers you push test</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2318.12" data-end="2319.86">Suites to it test Suites get set out to</span> <span data-start="2319.86" data-end="2321">the clients and then come back the</span> <span data-start="2321" data-end="2326.16">results come back let me I'm going to</span> <span data-start="2326.16" data-end="2327.99">try and do a live demo let's see how</span> <span data-start="2327.99" data-end="2334.02">this works so this is a the main page of</span> <span data-start="2334.02" data-end="2336.12">test form here let me just see it reload</span> <span data-start="2336.12" data-end="2339.84">and see how it looks so we can see here</span> <span data-start="2339.84" data-end="2342.06">these are the browsers so we have chrome</span> <span data-start="2342.06" data-end="2344.1">firefox internet explorer Opera Safari</span> <span data-start="2344.1" data-end="2346.74">and the little red number is how many</span> <span data-start="2346.74" data-end="2348.51">clients are Colonel connect it's only a</span> <span data-start="2348.51" data-end="2350.82">few clients right now some of them are</span> <span data-start="2350.82" data-end="2352.47">my clients here locally on this machine</span> <span data-start="2352.47" data-end="2354.75">summer on a machine back at home it just</span> <span data-start="2354.75" data-end="2357.11">kind of spread out at the moment and</span> <span data-start="2357.11" data-end="2359.37">this way so you can sort of see get a</span> <span data-start="2359.37" data-end="2362.22">picture of like how did the health of</span> <span data-start="2362.22" data-end="2365.85">the swarm at the moment so one of the</span> <span data-start="2365.85" data-end="2368.91">things i want to do here is this is the</span> <span data-start="2368.91" data-end="2371.82">page to submit a new job and that you</span> <span data-start="2371.82" data-end="2376.32">can a resolution you can name your job</span> <span data-start="2376.32" data-end="2379.02">and submit it say how many times you</span> <span data-start="2379.02" data-end="2381.12">want to run if you want to have multiple</span> <span data-start="2381.12" data-end="2383.73">run multiple times in this case and then</span> <span data-start="2383.73" data-end="2386.58">you can you can write out say list all</span> <span data-start="2386.58" data-end="2387.93">your tests feats that you want to run</span> <span data-start="2387.93" data-end="2390.15">one of the things that I did is I took</span> <span data-start="2390.15" data-end="2391.98">the jQuery test suite the jQuery Destry</span> <span data-start="2391.98" data-end="2394.11">is broken up with sub modules what I'm</span> <span data-start="2394.11" data-end="2395.88">doing is I'm running each sub module</span> <span data-start="2395.88" data-end="2398.49">individually and I'll show you why in a</span> <span data-start="2398.49" data-end="2401.75">second so I'm going to submit this to</span> <span data-start="2401.75" data-end="2407.19">test form and it presents me with this</span> <span data-start="2407.19" data-end="2409.11">page and we'll probably start to get</span> <span data-start="2409.11" data-end="2411.93">results here within a few seconds there</span> <span data-start="2411.93" data-end="2414.26">we go I you stick to the first on board</span> <span data-start="2414.26" data-end="2417.03">yellow means it's running so you can see</span> <span data-start="2417.03" data-end="2418.88">there's 2i you six instances connected</span> <span data-start="2418.88" data-end="2422.76">in this case operas 96 was the first one</span> <span data-start="2422.76" data-end="2426.18">to get something to pass and you see the</span> <span data-start="2426.18" data-end="2428.94">results to start to trickle in here so a</span> <span data-start="2428.94" data-end="2430.58">couple browsers haven't connected the</span> <span data-start="2430.58" data-end="2433.11">clients ping the server every 30 seconds</span> <span data-start="2433.11" data-end="2434.85">or so so the more clients that are</span> <span data-start="2434.85" data-end="2437.01">connected the more likely in</span> <span data-start="2437.01" data-end="2440.4">need to have this finish quickly so one</span> <span data-start="2440.4" data-end="2442.77">thing here is that a notice no fire box</span> <span data-start="2442.77" data-end="2444.48">three tests running that's because</span> <span data-start="2444.48" data-end="2447.3">there's no firefox 3 client connected so</span> <span data-start="2447.3" data-end="2448.41">i'll connect here I'll show you what</span> <span data-start="2448.41" data-end="2450.81">it's like to join the swarm I'll put in</span> <span data-start="2450.81" data-end="2453.48">my username and I'll say join it's very</span> <span data-start="2453.48" data-end="2455.58">crude right now you can see that it just</span> <span data-start="2455.58" data-end="2457.74">goes connects and it's literally running</span> <span data-start="2457.74" data-end="2461.94">an iframe it's nothing that fancy and it</span> <span data-start="2461.94" data-end="2463.47">takes results that runs it when it</span> <span data-start="2463.47" data-end="2465.45">completes it sends real results back to</span> <span

data-end="2479.79">all this in a trickle in and it doesn't</span> <span data-start="2479.79" data-end="2482.37">take that long maybe a minute or so and</span> <span data-start="2482.37" data-end="2483.93">this is like with like one client</span> <span data-start="2483.93" data-end="2486.81">connected of each if it was like 23 or</span> <span data-start="2486.81" data-end="2488.91">even let's say 100 clients connected</span> <span data-start="2488.91" data-end="2492.48">from an x 46 you know it said that you</span> <span data-start="2492.48" data-end="2494.19">things will finish within a matter of</span> <span data-start="2494.19" data-end="2498.81">seconds ah with these models different</span> <span data-start="2498.81" data-end="2501.69">browsers on when your games so someone</span> <span data-start="2501.69" data-end="2505.49">that comes when I say some surf playing</span> <span data-start="2505.49"

data-end="2515.49">well they probably wouldn't be the wiser</span> <span data-start="2515.49" data-end="2518.64">you know they want to know as long as</span> <span data-start="2518.64" data-end="2522.66">the test didn't uh you know like put up</span> <span data-start="2522.66" data-end="2524.99">an alert or something yeah I don't know</span> <span data-start="2524.99" data-end="2530.1">so in this case I left an error in that</span> <span data-start="2530.1" data-end="2532.47">there's one I knew this isn't happen</span> <span data-start="2532.47" data-end="2535.29">this is ok so a one there's two tests</span> <span data-start="2535.29" data-end="2538.59">failing in internet explorer you know</span> <span data-start="2538.59" data-end="2540.75">explorer 6 and the selector module so</span> <span data-start="2540.75" data-end="2542.67">for one of the things i did is is that</span> <span data-start="2542.67" data-end="2546.36">since i can't see the results um you</span> <span data-start="2546.36" data-end="2547.47">know I don't have a screenshot anything</span> <span data-start="2547.47" data-end="2549.87">was I I dumped all the results from all</span> <span data-start="2549.87" data-end="2553.14">these so I can go in and I can view the</span> <span data-start="2553.14" data-end="2558.69">internet explorer 6 results so this is</span> <span data-start="2558.69" data-end="2560.72">literally what was submitted back from</span> <span data-start="2560.72" data-end="2564.06">the client and this in explore 6 this is</span> <span data-start="2564.06" data-end="2565.47">running on a machine back at home in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2565.47" data-end="2568.63">Boston so this isn't running here</span> <span data-start="2568.63" data-end="2571.36">and I can go down and I can see up you</span> <span data-start="2571.36" data-end="2573.49">know there's the actual failure oh and I</span> <span data-start="2573.49" data-end="2575.2">can see the results and I can debug it</span> <span data-start="2575.2" data-end="2576.97">or what have you you know this is as</span> <span data-start="2576.97" data-end="2579.25">good as I could get back at home but I</span> <span data-start="2579.25" data-end="2580.9">don't I don't have to have access to the</span> <span data-start="2580.9" data-end="2583.72">IE six or seven machines in order to run</span> <span data-start="2583.72" data-end="2586.9">this so I think this is a pretty</span> <span data-start="2586.9" data-end="2588.49">incident I think this is a good first</span> <span data-start="2588.49" data-end="2593.56">step but the ultimate direction you want</span> <span data-start="2593.56" data-end="2597.49">to go in is it's just a house something</span> <span data-start="2597.49" data-end="2602.02">like this and this is sort of what I</span> <span data-start="2602.02" data-end="2603.64">call into the tender box this is</span> <span data-start="2603.64" data-end="2606.76">suddenly we have at Mozilla when</span> <span data-start="2606.76" data-end="2610.3">business this is commits by browser so</span> <span data-start="2610.3" data-end="2612.67">you see each individual commit and how</span> <span data-start="2612.67" data-end="2615.67">or if it changed the you know the tree</span> <span data-start="2615.67" data-end="2617.83">so in this case we can see that you know</span> <span data-start="2617.83" data-end="2620.11">at least in the last couple commits the</span> <span data-start="2620.11" data-end="2624.1">the tree is burning no Linga

<span data-start="2627.55" data-end="2630.04">browsers so in this this way you have</span> <span data-start="2630.04" data-end="2633.31">now have sort of a complete distributed</span> <span

data-end="2648.19">working a ok and that's ok to commit or</span> <span data-start="2648.19" data-end="2650.35">you can find out who broke what and go</span> <span data-start="2650.35" data-end="2652.24">and blame them or you know or what have</span> <span data-start="2652.24" data-end="2654.64">you so I think this is like the ultimate</span> <span data-start="2654.64" data-end="2660.16">you know good result of test one but the</span> <span data-start="2660.16" data-end="2663.19">thing is that ok well you're doing this</span> <span data-start="2663.19"

of</span> <span data-start="2683.49" data-end="2684.84">cases where this could be used there's</span> <span data-start="2684.84" data-end="2688.92">um okay they said there's before pre</span> <span

that that</span> <span data-start="4066.42" data-end="4068.55">happens already such a small percentage</span> <span data-start="4068.55" data-end="4070.2">but I see in the next going here it</span> <span data-start="4070.2" data-end="4073.11">feels like absolutely man where you</span> <span data-start="4073.11" data-end="4075.3">can't pop much for everything so then</span> <span data-start="4075.3" data-end="4078.06">you end up you make up track flexible if</span> <span data-start="4078.06" data-end="4081.42">you made it directly simple and you know</span> <span data-start="4081.42" data-end="4083.28">where I just wear your thought like</span> <span data-start="4083.28" data-end="4085.2">where do you think that's had that's</span> <span data-start="4085.2" data-end="4089.48">tricky I mean the problem is is that i</span> <span data-start="4089.48" data-end="4094.69">don't i don't think it's possible to</span> <span data-start="4094.7" data-end="4097.17">what okay so this is I mean essentially</span> <span data-start="4097.17" data-end="4098.94">you're trying to optimize for as many</span> <span data-start="4098.94" data-end="4101.819">use cases as possible and I think it's</span> <span data-start="4101.819" data-end="4103.83">important to optimize always optimized</span> <span data-start="4103.83" data-end="4106.68">for the most common use case both in the</span> <span data-start="4106.68" data-end="4108.75">design of your API but within the</span> <span data-start="4108.75" data-end="4110.819">performance of the API as well you know</span> <span data-start="4110.819" data-end="4115.95">if if you know let's say that the the</span> <span data-start="4115.95" data-end="4118.64">common case of setting an attribute is</span> <span data-start="4118.64" data-end="4121.53">um you know that should be faster than</span> <span data-start="4121.53" data-end="4123.9">some other use case that is not so</span> <span data-start="4123.9" data-end="4127.95">common so at the very least I think that</span> <span data-start="4127.95" data-end="4131.85">when optimizing you should always go for</span> <span data-start="4131.85" data-end="4135.12">the most common case but without</span> <span data-start="4135.12" data-end="4137.069">significantly degrading the performance</span> <span data-start="4137.069" data-end="4142.5">of the other cases yeah I don't know I</span> <span data-start="4142.5" data-end="4144.96">think when the problems that comes up</span> <span data-start="4144.96" data-end="4147.78">fairly often is is that you have an API</span> <span data-start="4147.78" data-end="4150.5">structure to meet a specific need and</span> <span data-start="4150.5" data-end="4153.87">then but something else you know loses</span> <span data-start="4153.87" data-end="4158.22">out like for example jquery has CSS</span> <span data-start="4158.22" data-end="4160.859">selector support and its generic and</span> <span data-start="4160.859" data-end="4163.799">designed to support any selector but at</span> <span data-start="4163.799" data-end="4166.38">that cost is some degra gate degradation</span> <span data-start="4166.38" data-end="4168.27">and that ego has to do some string</span> <span data-start="4168.27" data-end="4170.22">parsing and determine you know what</span> <span data-start="4170.22" data-end="4174.03">exactly the user inputted and when we</span> <span data-start="4174.03" data-end="4175.29">first implemented that there were some</span> <span data-start="4175.29" data-end="4178.08">cases that lost like for example just</span> <span data-start="4178.08" data-end="4180.21">getting an element by ID that case</span> <span data-start="4180.21" data-end="4182.49">should be fast you know and that was a</span> <span data-start="4182.49" data-end="4185.52">case that lost out and so what we did</span> <span data-start="4185.52" data-end="4187.319">wind up doing is we ended doing some</span> <span data-start="4187.319" data-end="4191.19">very specific code paths in jQuery just</span> <span data-start="4191.19" data-end="4193.38">to handle that one case so in that case</span> <span data-start="4193.38" data-end="4194.52">we because that was something that</span> <span data-start="4194.52" data-end="4196.13">people did so often that</span> <span data-start="4196.13" data-end="4199.699">how to make sure that it stayed fast and</span> <span data-start="4199.699" data-end="4202.429">at the same time the generic common CSS</span> <span data-start="4202.429" data-end="4204.05">selector API you know is still what it</span> <span data-start="4204.05" data-end="4206.63">is you know it we didn't affect that in</span> <span data-start="4206.63" data-end="4210.86">any way hope that answers yeah City Hall</span> <span data-start="4210.86" data-end="4215.27">forever I think we're pretty much out of</span> <span data-start="4215.27" data-end="4217.88">time here so feel free to stab me</span> <span data-start="4217.88" data-end="4220.76">afterwards and we can chat some more but</span> <span data-start="4220.76" data-end="4232.79">yeah so thanks for having me talk</span> </p>
