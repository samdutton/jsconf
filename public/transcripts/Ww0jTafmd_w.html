<p><span data-start="9.74" data-end="14.28">okay so my talk is called elements of</span> <span data-start="14.28" data-end="18.26">dance music um we're going to chat on</span> <span data-start="18.26" data-end="21.75">how to make people dance with music is</span> <span data-start="21.75" data-end="25.41">that another appropriate title so yeah</span> <span data-start="25.41" data-end="27.21">we're going to make music using only</span> <span data-start="27.21" data-end="31.08">maths no not a lot of sound samples no</span> <span data-start="31.08" data-end="34.73">nothing just like pure mathematics and</span> <span data-start="34.73" data-end="39.29">might even work we'll see how it goes so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="39.29" data-end="42.66">I'm Paul I work at Mozilla on the Web</span> <span data-start="42.66" data-end="45.809">Audio API implementation I also do the</span> <span data-start="45.809" data-end="49.86">spec work at the w3c so we end up like</span> <span data-start="49.86" data-end="52.62">we write this massive massive massive</span> <span data-start="52.62" data-end="56.37">massive document that ends up telling</span> <span data-start="56.37" data-end="58.559">you how exactly where would you EP I</span> <span data-start="58.559" data-end="64.049">should work and and when I'm not working</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="64.049" data-end="66.96">I actually just make music with like</span> <span data-start="66.96" data-end="69.6">normal people not with math and software</span> <span data-start="69.6" data-end="73.52">and everything like that so yeah alright</span> <span data-start="73.52" data-end="78.33">without further due let's talk about</span> <span data-start="78.33" data-end="81.869">what we have for today so we'll do a</span> <span data-start="81.869" data-end="84.27">brief introduction and try to define and</span> <span data-start="84.27" data-end="88.2">characterize why is music yes big task</span> <span data-start="88.2" data-end="90.42">so it's going to be scoped pretty gnarly</span> <span data-start="90.42" data-end="93.57">and then we'll chat a bit of a verte a</span> <span data-start="93.57" data-end="95.369">specific genre of music school acid</span> <span data-start="95.369" data-end="98.79">techno general i like very much and</span> <span data-start="98.79" data-end="100.14">maybe do a little bit of the</span> <span data-start="100.14" data-end="104.63">construction of an acid techno track so</span> <span data-start="104.63" data-end="107.43">yeah listen to a couple tunes we'll see</span> <span data-start="107.43" data-end="109.14">how it goes maybe you understand the</span> <span data-start="109.14" data-end="114.96">parts of it and then we will learn on</span> <span data-start="114.96" data-end="117.78">how to like how Web Audio actually works</span> <span data-start="117.78" data-end="124.229">and try to bend these to make do an</span> <span data-start="124.229" data-end="126.84">actual technotrack like to make sound to</span> <span data-start="126.84" data-end="128.64">make the drums to make the synthesizers</span> <span data-start="128.64" data-end="131.64">and to make the yeah the Sun we want and</span> <span data-start="131.64" data-end="133.41">then we my</span> <span data-start="133.41" data-end="136.65">it's even try to do it live in a text</span> <span data-start="136.65" data-end="138.42">editor and just like you know dry too</span> <span data-start="138.42" data-end="141.75">quick dirty technotrack like and then</span> <span data-start="141.75" data-end="144.6">five and write some more texts and six</span> <span data-start="144.6" data-end="147.51">in my work seven if we have a good tune</span> <span data-start="147.51" data-end="150.45">me out just get up and dance right all</span> <span data-start="150.45" data-end="154.77">right first what is music so it's a</span> <span data-start="154.77" data-end="157.41">simplistic a simple definition is not by</span> <span data-start="157.41" data-end="160.8">any mean like the one definition react</span> <span data-start="160.8" data-end="165.53">academicians use to me and for today</span> <span data-start="165.53" data-end="170.81">music is rhythm + melody + timber right</span> <span data-start="170.81" data-end="175.86">so rhythm can be characterized the</span> <span data-start="175.86" data-end="177.66">absence of presence of a sound at some</span> <span data-start="177.66" data-end="179.7">point in time and the duration of its</span> <span data-start="179.7" data-end="182.52">sound so for example we have a note HB</span> <span data-start="182.52" data-end="185.33">for a quarter beat and we're gonna have</span> <span data-start="185.33" data-end="190.86">140 beats per minute right melody is the</span> <span data-start="190.86" data-end="192.63">sex session of a sound that have a</span> <span data-start="192.63" data-end="196.05">height a pitch and they constitute like</span> <span data-start="196.05" data-end="198.45">a unity right so it's a tune you can</span> <span data-start="198.45" data-end="201.06">sing and you remember that's desa melody</span> <span data-start="201.06" data-end="203.88">and what is more important to me and for</span> <span data-start="203.88" data-end="205.92">us today is a chamber so it's the</span> <span data-start="205.92" data-end="208.68">entrancing sunny quality of the sound so</span> <span data-start="208.68" data-end="211.11">for example is it like a pure tone is it</span> <span data-start="211.11" data-end="213.36">pitched like can you can you determine</span> <span data-start="213.36" data-end="216.48">the height is it a metallic sound is it</span> <span data-start="216.48" data-end="218.85">like bold like a violin is it like a</span> <span data-start="218.85" data-end="220.53">vocal like someone is speaking or</span> <span data-start="220.53" data-end="225.18">singing so yeah today we're gonna focus</span> <span data-start="225.18" data-end="228.15">on on tamron like actually making sound</span> <span data-start="228.15" data-end="232.29">that sound nice and yeah the code is</span> <span data-start="232.29" data-end="234.39">already written to make it sound where</span> <span data-start="234.39" data-end="238.77">it's like when it should happen and and</span> <span data-start="238.77" data-end="242.61">the notes already 13 so yeah but yet</span> <span data-start="242.61" data-end="244.2">tember isn't what is important for us</span> <span data-start="244.2" data-end="248.37">today okay so now we can talk maybe</span> <span data-start="248.37" data-end="252.3">about a general music school acid techno</span> <span data-start="252.3" data-end="254.31">is going to be a focus for today so the</span> <span data-start="254.31" data-end="256.76">sound design that we're going to do</span> <span data-start="256.76" data-end="273.4">might sound like that</span> <span data-start="273.41" data-end="277.08">alright so say yes electronic music as</span> <span data-start="277.08" data-end="281.1">you as you can hear got creating Chicago</span> <span data-start="281.1" data-end="286.68">and Detroit in late 80s Early 90s so</span> <span data-start="286.68" data-end="291.389">yeah so in this I in this specific track</span> <span data-start="291.389" data-end="294.99">that I made quickly the other day you</span> <span data-start="294.99" data-end="297.6">can hear two machines so it roland</span> <span data-start="297.6" data-end="300.86">tb-303 which is an bass synthesizer</span> <span data-start="300.86" data-end="304.97">which is like the little tone very harsh</span> <span data-start="304.97" data-end="308.52">very fast and there is like a roland</span> <span data-start="308.52" data-end="310.47">tr-808 which is drum machine so it's got</span> <span data-start="310.47" data-end="314.55">the kick drum clap hi hats so if we</span> <span data-start="314.55" data-end="320.82">listen to it again ok so in here we've</span> <span data-start="320.82" data-end="325.05">got the kick drum right and then we have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="325.05" data-end="334.63">America's sound then we have some claps</span> <span data-start="334.64" data-end="339.24">right if we mix the drum together okay</span> <span data-start="339.24" data-end="347.71">cool then we've got a baseline</span> <span data-start="347.72" data-end="350.91">kinnear it changes i'll just play</span> <span data-start="350.91" data-end="357.61">you</span> <span data-start="357.62" data-end="359.82">and then if you mix everything and add</span> <span data-start="359.82" data-end="361.85">some delay and reverb like some effects</span> <span data-start="361.85" data-end="365.669">okay so that's the kind of the goal for</span> <span data-start="365.669" data-end="368.25">today so while we're doing it techno in</span> <span data-start="368.25" data-end="370.4">the first place it sounds good right</span> <span data-start="370.4" data-end="373.44">that's one thing it's also very simple</span> <span data-start="373.44" data-end="375.27">to code so i can explain you wear with</span> <span data-start="375.27" data-end="379.44">your concepts with that so the kick the</span> <span data-start="379.44" data-end="380.61">clap in the rad cast we're going to</span> <span data-start="380.61" data-end="384.06">we're going to synthesize are actually</span> <span data-start="384.06" data-end="386.19">going to be tr-808 simulation that's why</span> <span data-start="386.19" data-end="387.93">i was presenting this machine and the</span> <span data-start="387.93" data-end="390.21">baseline is going to be a tb-303 like</span> <span data-start="390.21" data-end="394.53">sound okay so without further ado let's</span> <span data-start="394.53" data-end="396.99">introduce the audio context and now from</span> <span data-start="396.99" data-end="399.06">no one's going to be all JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="399.06" data-end="401.46">some codes on the slide so please pay</span> <span data-start="401.46" data-end="404.91">attention is going to be worthwhile okay</span> <span data-start="404.91" data-end="409.44">so you've got this thing fire AC equals</span> <span data-start="409.44" data-end="413.729">new audio context and really when you</span> <span data-start="413.729" data-end="415.65">talk about where would your API there</span> <span data-start="415.65" data-end="417.21">are three main concepts you've gone know</span> <span data-start="417.21" data-end="418.919">your context you've got all your nodes</span> <span data-start="418.919" data-end="422.33">and you've got audio params right so</span> <span data-start="422.33" data-end="425.13">you've got a number of audio nodes like</span> <span data-start="425.13" data-end="426.479">a key I've seen this picture and you</span> <span data-start="426.479" data-end="428.55">connect them together using the Kinect</span> <span data-start="428.55" data-end="431.01">call so if you connect an oscillator</span> <span data-start="431.01" data-end="433.949">node to a gain node you will apply the</span> <span data-start="433.949" data-end="435.479">processing of the gain node from the</span> <span data-start="435.479" data-end="437.22">oscillator node and then if you connect</span> <span data-start="437.22" data-end="439.62">something to the destination node then</span> <span data-start="439.62" data-end="440.76">you will actually hear it in your</span> <span data-start="440.76" data-end="445.71">speakers which is what we need right so</span> <span data-start="445.71" data-end="448.08">what can you do with an audio context</span> <span data-start="448.08" data-end="450.78">you can you have the destination you</span> <span data-start="450.78" data-end="453.15">connect things to his destination you</span> <span data-start="453.15" data-end="455.34">have the current time so it's the time</span> <span data-start="455.34" data-end="458.13">of the audio context it's always going</span> <span data-start="458.13" data-end="461.43">forward you cannot really pose it it</span> <span data-start="461.43" data-end="463.02">cannot go backwards so it's always</span> <span data-start="463.02" data-end="465.69">progressing then you can create some of</span> <span data-start="465.69" data-end="467.639">your notes so for example an audio</span> <span data-start="467.639" data-end="469.71">buffer source node I can play another</span> <span data-start="469.71" data-end="473.19">buffer a gain node can change the volume</span> <span data-start="473.19" data-end="476.61">of its input an oscillator node can play</span> <span data-start="476.61" data-end="478.38">a simple wave form like a sine wave</span> <span data-start="478.38" data-end="481.169">square wave and things like that and a</span> <span data-start="481.169" data-end="483.21">biquad filter node can filter the sound</span> <span data-start="483.21" data-end="484.8">and alter its characteristics for</span> <span data-start="484.8" data-end="486.24">example removing the high</span> <span data-start="486.24" data-end="487.86">frequencies all the low frequencies or</span> <span data-start="487.86" data-end="489.599">something like that we will see more</span> <span data-start="489.599" data-end="493.319">example in a second what can you do when</span> <span data-start="493.319" data-end="495.06">you get an oscillator node so an</span> <span data-start="495.06" data-end="496.5">oscillator node can be connected to</span> <span data-start="496.5" data-end="499.349">another node you can also disconnect it</span> <span data-start="499.349" data-end="501.539">from the other nodes you can set the</span> <span data-start="501.539" data-end="503.009">frequency that is the height of the</span> <span data-start="503.009" data-end="506.009">sound you can slightly ditch you Nate to</span> <span data-start="506.009" data-end="508.05">make it more interesting you can change</span> <span data-start="508.05" data-end="509.88">this type for example whether it's a</span> <span data-start="509.88" data-end="513.51">sine wave square wave or so to what we</span> <span data-start="513.51" data-end="515.669">will see that in a second you can start</span> <span data-start="515.669" data-end="519.45">it at some specific time and then also</span> <span data-start="519.45" data-end="524.42">stop it at a specific time audio program</span> <span data-start="524.42" data-end="527.61">as you can see the frequency here and</span> <span data-start="527.61" data-end="530.67">the detune are both audio params right</span> <span data-start="530.67" data-end="532.47">so what can you do with an audio</span> <span data-start="532.47" data-end="534.99">parameter you can set the value here you</span> <span data-start="534.99" data-end="536.7">can set the value at a specific time so</span> <span data-start="536.7" data-end="540.48">you say set value at time for 10 at</span> <span data-start="540.48" data-end="542.85">exactly 10 seconds the value we jump to</span> <span data-start="542.85" data-end="545.25">for you can do an exponential ramp to</span> <span data-start="545.25" data-end="547.74">value at time so it will do a smooth</span> <span data-start="547.74" data-end="550.08">ramp from the current value to the next</span> <span data-start="550.08" data-end="552.36">value using an exponential curve you can</span> <span data-start="552.36" data-end="554.7">do the same with a linear ramp and you</span> <span data-start="554.7" data-end="556.649">can do a set target at time that will</span> <span data-start="556.649" data-end="562.529">gradually become goes to value from the</span> <span data-start="562.529" data-end="566.42">time time and with those with a constant</span> <span data-start="566.42" data-end="569.07">which is I explain it later with more</span> <span data-start="569.07" data-end="571.32">examples so it goes like that when you</span> <span data-start="571.32" data-end="573.39">do any do / am so for example here we do</span> <span data-start="573.39" data-end="578.22">set value at time 1 20 at 120 seconds it</span> <span data-start="578.22" data-end="579.93">jumps and then we do linear rom to</span> <span data-start="579.93" data-end="583.56">evaluate I'm 22 seconds at 0 it goes</span> <span data-start="583.56" data-end="586.32">down gradually like that and then we set</span> <span data-start="586.32" data-end="588.24">value at time again and then we do a</span> <span data-start="588.24" data-end="589.74">setter I get a timing decreases</span> <span data-start="589.74" data-end="594.779">exponentially like that okay so now we</span> <span data-start="594.779" data-end="597.839">will actually hear some sound ok so we</span> <span data-start="597.839" data-end="601.26">do an oscillator we create a gain node</span> <span data-start="601.26" data-end="603.899">we set it to a sine wave and we set it</span> <span data-start="603.899" data-end="606.649">to an a for which is 44 in Hertz and</span> <span data-start="606.649" data-end="610.11">then we will see two inputs so we will</span> <span data-start="610.11" data-end="611.61">change the frequency and we will change</span> <span data-start="611.61" data-end="613.649">the game then we connect everything</span> <span data-start="613.649" data-end="619">together and we start so it</span> <span data-start="619" data-end="625.15">change the frequency and we can change</span> <span data-start="625.15" data-end="629.92">the game all right so it's just a sine</span> <span data-start="629.92" data-end="635.29">wave ok now we can change and use</span> <span data-start="635.29" data-end="639.209">different type of wave</span> <span data-start="639.209" data-end="644.4">that's a square</span> <span data-start="644.41" data-end="647.97">and that's a triangle</span> <span data-start="647.97" data-end="650.59">and now we have a sawtooth</span> <span data-start="650.59" data-end="653.05">so it's different sounds pretty useful</span> <span data-start="653.05" data-end="656.62">all right now what can we do like this</span> <span data-start="656.62" data-end="658.36">pretty static not very interesting so we</span> <span data-start="658.36" data-end="661.9">can we can change things using the audio</span> <span data-start="661.9" data-end="664.24">param methods so for example if we take</span> <span data-start="664.24" data-end="666.49">a very low sine wave at a hundred Hertz</span> <span data-start="666.49" data-end="669.82">and then we set value at time at 120</span> <span data-start="669.82" data-end="673">which is no volume reduction and we set</span> <span data-start="673" data-end="675.67">a look at that time at 0 to 0 which is</span> <span data-start="675.67" data-end="683.18">silent it will do something like that</span> <span data-start="683.19" data-end="687.01">right can start to hear the start of a</span> <span data-start="687.01" data-end="690.43">kick drum maybe I one sec maybe you can</span> <span data-start="690.43" data-end="692.29">do a bit more so if you change the pitch</span> <span data-start="692.29" data-end="700.03">at the same time maybe yeah start</span> <span data-start="700.03" data-end="703.54">sketching like a kick drum okay we'll</span> <span data-start="703.54" data-end="708.4">see you later now we need a bass sound</span> <span data-start="708.4" data-end="710.83">right so what can we do we get like two</span> <span data-start="710.83" data-end="714.19">oscillators maybe to sawtooth set it to</span> <span data-start="714.19" data-end="716.98">the same frequency we're going to same</span> <span data-start="716.98"

value of the frequency and then we</span> <span data-start="724.57" data-end="725.8">connect everything together like the</span> <span data-start="725.8" data-end="738.67">usual okay</span> <span data-start="738.68" data-end="742.01">sounds better right yeah so yeah some</span> <span data-start="742.01" data-end="746.27">techniques we can we can learn</span> <span data-start="746.28" data-end="750.28">okay we need a bit more okay no need to</span> <span data-start="750.28" data-end="751.9">introduce a bit like a bit of a heavy</span> <span data-start="751.9" data-end="753.76">beasts like the Fourier transform your</span> <span data-start="753.76" data-end="756.88">friends so you can you can look at the</span> <span data-start="756.88" data-end="759.07">sound in the time domain where you see a</span> <span data-start="759.07" data-end="760.96">sine wave like looks like a sine wave</span> <span data-start="760.96" data-end="764.41">you all know we can also you see it in</span> <span data-start="764.41" data-end="767.35">the frequency domain where in the x-axis</span> <span data-start="767.35" data-end="768.91">you've got the frequency and in the</span> <span data-start="768.91" data-end="771.97">y-axis you've got the actual amplitude</span> <span data-start="771.97" data-end="782.8">and then if we change the frequency so</span> <span data-start="782.8" data-end="787.03">yeah and if you change this he changed</span> <span data-start="787.03" data-end="793.36">it to square the number of different</span> <span data-start="793.36" data-end="795.57">patterns here</span> <span data-start="795.57" data-end="798.18">right so this just thing we're all using</span> <span data-start="798.18" data-end="801.27">the next point so now which we can do is</span> <span data-start="801.27" data-end="805.14">to filter the bass the bass right so for</span> <span data-start="805.14" data-end="809.7">that we use a biquad filter and we'll</span> <span data-start="809.7" data-end="812.01">get a saw tooth and we'll debt unit like</span> <span data-start="812.01" data-end="815.88">previously and then set a pretty low</span> <span data-start="815.88" data-end="818.34">frequency value and then we will get a</span> <span data-start="818.34" data-end="820.98">low pass so what the low pass is it lets</span> <span data-start="820.98" data-end="823.8">through the bass sound and it cuts the</span> <span data-start="823.8" data-end="826.56">high frequencies and then we will change</span> <span data-start="826.56" data-end="828.6">various characteristics of the bike</span> <span data-start="828.6" data-end="831.45">words so the frequency which is is it</span> <span data-start="831.45" data-end="834.96">cutting the high frequency at a very</span> <span data-start="834.96" data-end="838.71">high sound or very low sound the queue</span> <span data-start="838.71" data-end="841.92">you'll see in a second so what can we do</span> <span data-start="841.92" data-end="848.33">with us ok so we have a base right and</span> <span data-start="848.33" data-end="856.86">the red line is the filter right</span> <span data-start="856.87" data-end="866.24">we can change the characteristic amounts</span> <span data-start="866.25" data-end="868.64">all right</span> <span data-start="868.64" data-end="875.389">so the QE is little notch</span> <span data-start="875.399" data-end="879.819">let's call the resonance filter of</span> <span data-start="879.819" data-end="882.549">course you can go get high pass which is</span> <span data-start="882.549" data-end="886.549">exactly do</span> <span data-start="886.559" data-end="889.899">he cuts the law and like the high</span> <span data-start="889.899" data-end="892.54">frequencies like a treble stays here</span> <span data-start="892.54" data-end="901.36">right and then you've got various other</span> <span data-start="901.36" data-end="904.149">stuff like a like a band pass that lets</span> <span data-start="904.149" data-end="906.179">through you're near specific frequency</span> <span data-start="906.179" data-end="912.91">but then we won't use it for now okay so</span> <span data-start="912.91" data-end="915.22">now what can we do like we go on and on</span> <span data-start="915.22" data-end="919.629">and on we create a buffer and then we</span> <span data-start="919.629" data-end="923.619">fill it with random noise not random so</span> <span data-start="923.619" data-end="925.689">it's noise between minus one and one</span> <span data-start="925.689" data-end="929.92">okay what's can Ladd to let me just drop</span> <span data-start="929.92" data-end="934.48">the balloon just noise it's gonna be</span> <span data-start="934.48" data-end="937.379">very useful to do or America's sound</span> <span data-start="937.379" data-end="940.98">just like yeah just random noise really</span> <span data-start="940.98" data-end="945.61">okay and then yeah for the clap I didn't</span> <span data-start="945.61" data-end="948.1">really feel like synthesizing a clump</span> <span data-start="948.1" data-end="950.709">because pretty hard so I'm using all the</span> <span data-start="950.709"

data-end="1077.32">minute which is normal for technology</span> <span data-start="1077.32" data-end="1079.96">and then we have a kick as we heard</span> <span data-start="1079.96"

data-end="1105.22">know what that is but like just just</span> <span data-start="1105.22" data-end="1108.67">know it's really then what we are doing</span> <span data-start="1108.67" data-end="1112.99">yeah we get s4 since we get to know do</span> <span data-start="1112.99" data-end="1115.33">contacts here we set the track so the</span> <span data-start="1115.33"

data-end="1137.65">like text Jewish nation so the clock</span> <span data-start="1137.65" data-end="1140.98">lets us know what time it is in the</span> <span data-start="1140.98" data-end="1143.71">track we count not in seconds but in</span> <span data-start="1143.71" data-end="1145.74">beats that's easier if you want to do</span> <span data-start="1145.74" data-end="1149.47">audio-visual synchronization yeah so we</span> <span data-start="1149.47" data-end="1151.72">start the track and then we have a</span> <span data-start="1151.72" data-end="1154.45">little scheduler here so the scheduler</span> <span data-start="1154.45" data-end="1157.12">is continuously looping in the track and</span> <span data-start="1157.12"

which and which instrument</span> <span data-start="1162.81" data-end="1165.23">has to play it so this is not very</span> <span data-start="1165.23" data-end="1167.67">complicated nor important topic for</span> <span data-start="1167.67" data-end="1171.51">today so let's just close it right so we</span> <span data-start="1171.51" data-end="1173.94">have four empty slots here we want to</span> <span data-start="1173.94" data-end="1176.52">kick drum whoops we want to kick drum we</span> <span data-start="1176.52" data-end="1179.49">want hi hats we want to clap and we want</span> <span data-start="1179.49" data-end="1182.61">to base right at the bottom is just the</span> <span data-start="1182.61" data-end="1185.25">initialization with the fetch and or new</span> <span data-start="1185.25" data-end="1186.57">audio context and everything so it's not</span> <span data-start="1186.57" data-end="1191.91">very important ok let's start trying to</span> <span data-start="1191.91" data-end="1196.17">make a kick drum right so it says boom</span> <span data-start="1196.17" data-end="1197.85">boom boom in the comment that's exactly</span> <span data-start="1197.85" data-end="1201.12">what's going to happen right so we're</span> <span data-start="1201.12" data-end="1204.33">going to get a first oscillator ok so we</span> <span data-start="1204.33" data-end="1209.4">do create oscillator and then what can</span> <span data-start="1209.4" data-end="1211.47">we do with an oscillator we can set the</span> <span data-start="1211.47" data-end="1218.07">type to a sine wave we can we also need</span> <span data-start="1218.07" data-end="1219.63">a gain node because we will need an</span> <span data-start="1219.63" data-end="1222.75">envelope so a kick is louder at the</span> <span data-start="1222.75" data-end="1224.61">beginning and quieter by the end so</span> <span data-start="1224.61" data-end="1228.26">let's gates let's get us a game node ok</span> <span data-start="1228.26" data-end="1233.19">create gain ok then of course we need to</span> <span data-start="1233.19" data-end="1237.69">connect the oscillator to the gain node</span> <span data-start="1237.69" data-end="1242.85">and the gain node to the actual</span> <span data-start="1242.85" data-end="1249.35">destination right we need to start the</span> <span data-start="1249.35" data-end="1252.51">oscillator in each function we get the</span> <span data-start="1252.51" data-end="1255.51">time T here so it's the time of which we</span> <span data-start="1255.51" data-end="1258.69">need to start the note and then we also</span> <span data-start="1258.69" data-end="1261">need to stop it at some point one second</span> <span data-start="1261" data-end="1262.32">is good is going to be shorter than one</span> <span data-start="1262.32" data-end="1263.61">second we need to stop it at some point</span> <span data-start="1263.61" data-end="1265.74">doesn't really matter and then we need</span> <span data-start="1265.74" data-end="1270.75">to decide like which curve we will get</span> <span data-start="1270.75" data-end="1275.64">to for our kick drum so let's start with</span> <span data-start="1275.64" data-end="1279.63">again so it's gonna it's going to start</span> <span data-start="1279.63" data-end="1283.17">at a full volume set value at time so</span> <span data-start="1283.17" data-end="1287.1">full volume is 120 and I was at T it's</span> <span data-start="1287.1" data-end="1288.66">at full volume so beginning of the kick</span> <span data-start="1288.66" data-end="1292.51">drum and then you will guard you leave</span> <span data-start="1292.51" data-end="1297.76">all target at time to 0 at time T as</span> <span data-start="1297.76" data-end="1302.62">well and the constant is how fast it</span> <span data-start="1302.62" data-end="1306.25">will go down so 0 dot one is pretty fast</span> <span data-start="1306.25" data-end="1309.58">but not too fast that's I guess it's</span> <span data-start="1309.58" data-end="1312.58">good then as we saw earlier we need to</span> <span data-start="1312.58" data-end="1315.97">set the we need to drop the frequency a</span> <span data-start="1315.97" data-end="1320.25">notch frequency okay set value at time</span> <span data-start="1320.25" data-end="1324.94">so a kick drum 120 Hertz is good I mean</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1324.94" data-end="1326.86">I'm just doing those values on the top</span> <span data-start="1326.86" data-end="1329.2">of my head really like I've kind of</span> <span data-start="1329.2" data-end="1331.6">listened to 808 kick sound and it</span> <span data-start="1331.6" data-end="1335.73">sounded good so I yeah I was alright and</span> <span data-start="1335.73" data-end="1340.8">then it'll it also drops to around 50 a</span> <span data-start="1340.8" data-end="1347.07">bit shorter okay so yeah maybe we can</span> <span data-start="1347.07" data-end="1352.69">try to hear do we hear something ok</span> <span data-start="1352.69" data-end="1362.51">let's Britta maybe you can make it a bit</span> <span data-start="1362.52" data-end="1367.12">yeah that's better so it's not that okay</span> <span data-start="1367.12" data-end="1370.45">um we can we can really make the kick</span> <span data-start="1370.45" data-end="1374.5">drum would be better if we do like a bit</span> <span data-start="1374.5" data-end="1378.64">more of an attack sound so I'm just</span> <span data-start="1378.64" data-end="1381.34">typing this real quick what we want is a</span> <span data-start="1381.34" data-end="1384.04">is a sound of the beater on the on the</span> <span data-start="1384.04" data-end="1385.51">kick drum right so it's going to be full</span> <span data-start="1385.51" data-end="1390.22">of high frequencies and yeah I'll see</span> <span data-start="1390.22" data-end="1396.55">how it goes so hmm just like doing</span> <span data-start="1396.55" data-end="1401.999">something real quick here</span> <span data-start="1402.009" data-end="1406.369">a second sound is exactly the same calls</span> <span data-start="1406.369" data-end="1415.7">a very much shorter though um what can</span> <span data-start="1415.7" data-end="1417.889">we do what do you need yeah oh and we</span> <span data-start="1417.889" data-end="1419.799">need to connect everything together</span> <span data-start="1419.799" data-end="1426.59">oscillator 2 with gain too oops into ok</span> <span data-start="1426.59" data-end="1430.279">does that sound better no it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1430.279" data-end="1441.35">what have I forgotten oh yeah so that's</span> <span data-start="1441.35" data-end="1445.519">a bit of a better kick right ok alright</span> <span data-start="1445.519" data-end="1447.019">that's good we've got a kick but we've</span> <span data-start="1447.019" data-end="1448.669">got a number of more instruments to go</span> <span data-start="1448.669" data-end="1453.82">right so let's start with some high hats</span> <span data-start="1453.82" data-end="1457.19">so for the high hats i canna sound like</span> <span data-start="1457.19" data-end="1461.059">a noise bursts but we need to remove the</span> <span data-start="1461.059" data-end="1463.129">low-frequency content because we it</span> <span data-start="1463.129" data-end="1465.019">doesn't have a real bass sound of high</span> <span data-start="1465.019" data-end="1468.799">hat not really so let's see we need to</span> <span data-start="1468.799" data-end="1472.279">play back a noise buffer so for that we</span> <span data-start="1472.279" data-end="1475.119">use the audio buffer source node thing</span> <span data-start="1475.119" data-end="1480.85">source ok and then we set its buffer to</span> <span

data-end="1492.19">buffer is just a buffer that contains</span> <span data-start="1492.19" data-end="1495.98">random values between minus 1 and 1 so</span> <span data-start="1495.98" data-end="1498.22">yeah it's just playing that box not very</span> <span data-start="1498.22" data-end="1501.74">complicated or anything and then of</span> <span data-start="1501.74" data-end="1504.159">course we always need a gain node</span> <span data-start="1504.159" data-end="1507.82">because percussions have like a</span> <span data-start="1507.82" data-end="1510.649">different amplitude during the of the</span> <span data-start="1510.649" data-end="1514.809">over the course of the sound creates gay</span> <span data-start="1514.809" data-end="1519.999">ok then we will need a high-pass filter</span> <span data-start="1519.999" data-end="1529.249">hpf create biquad filter ok and we will</span> <span data-start="1529.249" data-end="1534.409">set it too high pass so the high pass as</span> <span data-start="1534.409" data-end="1535.52">it I</span> <span data-start="1535.52" data-end="1538.1">name suggests it lets through the high</span> <span data-start="1538.1" data-end="1540.5">frequency let them pass but it cuts it</span> <span data-start="1540.5" data-end="1543.14">cuts the low frequency right and we set</span> <span data-start="1543.14" data-end="1546.56">it to a frequency of randomly chosen</span> <span data-start="1546.56" data-end="1554.84">five thousand Hertz as usual we we</span> <span data-start="1554.84" data-end="1560">started at full volume at time T and oh</span> <span data-start="1560" data-end="1566.03">it's called gain and then it drops in</span> <span data-start="1566.03" data-end="1570.89">volume to 0 at time zero it's fairly</span> <span data-start="1570.89" data-end="1572.6">short so 0.02 is going to be a very</span> <span data-start="1572.6" data-end="1574.94">short sound then we need to connect</span> <span data-start="1574.94" data-end="1577.67">everything together so source connect</span> <span data-start="1577.67" data-end="1585.62">gain connect I pass filter connect these</span> <span data-start="1585.62" data-end="1588.89">dots sink and then we need to start it</span> <span data-start="1588.89" data-end="1593.84">and then stop it oh no no it will stop</span> <span data-start="1593.84" data-end="1595.31">whenever whenever it reach the end of</span> <span data-start="1595.31" data-end="1598.1">the buffer automatically okay so it does</span> <span data-start="1598.1" data-end="1604.55">that sound alright oh my season yeah so</span> <span data-start="1604.55" data-end="1611.79">that's a little symbol the Americas okay</span> <span data-start="1611.8" data-end="1617.12">okay cool ah ok we go now we need we</span> <span data-start="1617.12" data-end="1619.91">need a clap sound okay so clap is just</span> <span data-start="1619.91" data-end="1622.61">playing back the buffer so and we do</span> <span data-start="1622.61" data-end="1626.57">like virus source equals this AC create</span> <span data-start="1626.57" data-end="1629.47">before Souls exactly like before and</span> <span data-start="1629.47" data-end="1633.23">then we actually don't want it full</span> <span data-start="1633.23" data-end="1635.99">volume we want we want a bit not very</span> <span data-start="1635.99" data-end="1638.33">loud so we all create a gain node for</span> <span data-start="1638.33" data-end="1641.99">that as well you always have a ton of</span> <span data-start="1641.99" data-end="1643.48">game knows where you where would you</span> <span data-start="1643.48" data-end="1647.6">like a ton create gain okay and then we</span> <span data-start="1647.6" data-end="1649.88">connect the source to the game oops no</span> <span data-start="1649.88" data-end="1654.89">connect to the game and then connect the</span> <span data-start="1654.89" data-end="1660.14">game to the sink okay and then we need</span> <span data-start="1660.14" data-end="1664.04">to source dot buffer equals the clap a</span> <span data-start="1664.04" data-end="1667.79">clap is something we just got using this</span> <span data-start="1667.79" data-end="1669.89">fetch thing here</span> <span data-start="1669.89" data-end="1675.02">um and it's the sound of a clap and then</span> <span data-start="1675.02" data-end="1678.32">we start it same thing is going to be</span> <span data-start="1678.32" data-end="1682.12">stopped it's going to stop automatically</span> <span data-start="1682.12" data-end="1697.61">so does it's all right okay okay okay</span> <span data-start="1697.61" data-end="1700.97">and now we need as it is written in your</span> <span data-start="1700.97" data-end="1702.92">strength here we need to drop the bass</span> <span data-start="1702.92" data-end="1707.6">okay so let's do this as we saw to</span> <span data-start="1707.6" data-end="1710.54">sawtooth together slightly detuned sound</span> <span data-start="1710.54" data-end="1714.2">good so you're going to give it a go so</span> <span data-start="1714.2" data-end="1718.73">we need to create two oscillators then</span> <span data-start="1718.73" data-end="1722.09">we create a gain node always great to</span> <span data-start="1722.09" data-end="1730.04">gain node O'Kane okay and then we'll</span> <span data-start="1730.04" data-end="1733.21">need a filter as filters I'll call</span> <span data-start="1733.21" data-end="1740.99">create by quiet ok so we connect all</span> <span data-start="1740.99" data-end="1752.89">this little world together last two okay</span> <span data-start="1752.9" data-end="1756.24">then what can we do we need so as you</span> <span data-start="1756.24" data-end="1758.19">can see here we've got the actual notes</span> <span data-start="1758.19" data-end="1760.47">we need to play passage to us bio</span> <span data-start="1760.47" data-end="1764.52">scheduler isn't it nice so we need to</span> <span data-start="1764.52" data-end="1766.64">set the frequency of the nodes okay so</span> <span data-start="1766.64" data-end="1770.49">oscillator dot frequency dot set value</span> <span data-start="1770.49" data-end="1774.45">at time then we've got a little helper</span> <span data-start="1774.45" data-end="1777.48">at the top so from a note to a frequency</span> <span data-start="1777.48" data-end="1780.27">it's this barbaric formula that you can</span> <span data-start="1780.27" data-end="1785.07">find on Wikipedia so not to frack oh</span> <span data-start="1785.07" data-end="1790.98">it's tea and then same so I follow first</span> <span data-start="1790.98" data-end="1796.65">and the second one then we did tune one</span> <span data-start="1796.65" data-end="1800.43">oscillator like we saw in the slide</span> <span data-start="1800.43" data-end="1806.72">before and then set the two to sawtooth</span> <span data-start="1806.72" data-end="1811.01">so tooth because like in the original</span> <span data-start="1811.01" data-end="1813.87">303 you could choose between so 2000</span> <span data-start="1813.87" data-end="1815.61">square but i think i prefer the so to</span> <span data-start="1815.61" data-end="1820.07">sound so let's let's go with it and then</span> <span data-start="1820.07" data-end="1823.41">give it a little envelope so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1823.41" data-end="1836.96">sound boring gain gain set target oops</span> <span data-start="1836.96" data-end="1840.6">mm-hmm fairly short as short as the kick</span> <span data-start="1840.6" data-end="1842.4">because the kick was also zero point</span> <span data-start="1842.4" data-end="1847.38">wine in a constant then we will set some</span> <span data-start="1847.38" data-end="1852.63">value on the filter so fairly aggressive</span> <span data-start="1852.63" data-end="1858.89">resonance and then we will automate the</span> <span data-start="1858.89" data-end="1861.51">filter as well so the filter cutoff</span> <span data-start="1861.51" data-end="1863.67">frequency will change over the course of</span> <span data-start="1863.67" data-end="1866.16">the notes so the Sun will not get very I</span> <span data-start="1866.16" data-end="1869.19">will not be boring because boring sound</span> <span data-start="1869.19" data-end="1871.08">you just want to like shut it off and</span> <span data-start="1871.08" data-end="1875.01">really don't want to listen to it mmm so</span> <span data-start="1875.01" data-end="1876.96">let's start at three hundred again just</span> <span data-start="1876.96" data-end="1880.84">picking the value randomly</span> <span data-start="1880.85" data-end="1887">yeah and going up to 3,000 fairly short</span> <span data-start="1887" data-end="1891.79">again and the filter will let the bass</span> <span data-start="1891.79" data-end="1894.35">through and we'll cut off the high</span> <span data-start="1894.35" data-end="1897.11">frequency right so for that will use a</span> <span data-start="1897.11" data-end="1901.12">low pass because let lets the low pass</span> <span data-start="1901.12" data-end="1910.89">and then we start all that jars start t</span> <span data-start="1910.9" data-end="1917.41">stop at somewhere in the future t plus 1</span> <span data-start="1917.41" data-end="1923.24">okay is that gonna work I think it's</span> <span data-start="1923.24" data-end="1946.97">some licks okay I had for Burton to</span> <span data-start="1946.97" data-end="1949.3">connect it to the actual destination</span> <span data-start="1949.3" data-end="1954.86">yeah wasn't going to work okay let me</span> <span data-start="1954.86" data-end="1979.51">get this one back okay</span> <span data-start="1979.52" data-end="1984.57">alright so maybe we can try to make it a</span> <span data-start="1984.57" data-end="1988.5">little more interesting and can I'll</span> <span data-start="1988.5" data-end="1994.98">know I like 10 minutes okay what we can</span> <span data-start="1994.98" data-end="1998.04">do is to dynamically change the value of</span> <span data-start="1998.04" data-end="2006.5">the filter and so let's try that so</span> <span data-start="2006.5" data-end="2011.39">we'll put variable here prick equals and</span> <span data-start="2011.39" data-end="2016.46">then we'll drop a slider so if I are</span> <span data-start="2016.46" data-end="2023.08">equals document create element inputs</span> <span data-start="2023.08" data-end="2027.95">inputs these days with html5 can do</span> <span data-start="2027.95" data-end="2030.94">really crazy stuff input type range</span> <span data-start="2030.94" data-end="2037.37">input min on a thousand maybe and Max to</span> <span data-start="2037.37" data-end="2049.22">10,000 input step 1 then inputs on</span> <span data-start="2049.22" data-end="2059">inputs I'm going to go okay so we're</span> <span data-start="2059" data-end="2062.36">going to say Frank equals 0 dot target</span> <span data-start="2062.36" data-end="2066.889">what are you and so that will all change</span> <span data-start="2066.889" data-end="2070.399">the frequency of the filter of course I</span> <span data-start="2070.399" data-end="2077.76">need to do document appendchild oops</span> <span data-start="2077.77" data-end="2085.02">input no slider it's called I it's got</span> <span data-start="2085.03" data-end="2089.33">okay</span> <span data-start="2089.34" data-end="2092.179">is it working</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2092.179" data-end="2102.44">I lied saw one ah yeah good one okay is</span> <span data-start="2102.44" data-end="2140.839">that dropping a slider nothing is</span> <span data-start="2140.839" data-end="2143.93">starting to to work don't do only</span> <span data-start="2143.93" data-end="2148.16">something else um yeah I think I'm</span> <span data-start="2148.16" data-end="2150.319">pretty much done uh-oh can take</span> <span data-start="2150.319" data-end="2154.46">questions long yep Wow thank you Paul</span> <span data-start="2154.46" data-end="2160.46">big round of Gloucester so this is how</span> <span data-start="2160.46" data-end="2163.67">we learn how to make sounds and music</span> <span data-start="2163.67" data-end="2165.68">eventually I would love to have some</span> <span data-start="2165.68" data-end="2169.97">questions hi that's awesome I got a real</span> <span data-start="2169.97" data-end="2172.549">light away I got one question about the</span> <span data-start="2172.549" data-end="2174.849">way you're constructing the sounds yep</span> <span data-start="2174.849" data-end="2176.99">every time you trigger a sound you</span> <span data-start="2176.99" data-end="2178.91">you're constructing the whole thing is</span> <span data-start="2178.91" data-end="2179.99">there a reason you're doing that as</span> <span data-start="2179.99" data-end="2182.359">opposed to making a once and then doing</span> <span data-start="2182.359" data-end="2185.54">a start and stop each time so I've got</span> <span data-start="2185.54" data-end="2187.309">two answers for you the first answer</span> <span data-start="2187.309" data-end="2191">would be yes you could create your note</span> <span data-start="2191" data-end="2193.43">once and seek a gain node in front of it</span> <span data-start="2193.43" data-end="2196.94">and mute it the second answer is you</span> <span data-start="2196.94" data-end="2199.94">cannot restart a note once it started</span> <span data-start="2199.94" data-end="2202.64">and stopped you gots garbage collected</span> <span data-start="2202.64" data-end="2204.88">right so it's kind of like a</span> <span data-start="2204.88" data-end="2208.01">fire-and-forget kind of model the nodes</span> <span data-start="2208.01" data-end="2210.23">are extremely cheap to create and are</span> <span data-start="2210.23" data-end="2212.39">extremely cheap to destroy so that's it</span> <span data-start="2212.39" data-end="2215.48">simplifies the model so you don't have</span> <span data-start="2215.48" data-end="2216.98">to keep track of how many voices you</span> <span data-start="2216.98" data-end="2220.49">have and things like that so yeah two</span> <span data-start="2220.49" data-end="2223.549">models either create all the nodes in at</span> <span data-start="2223.549" data-end="2225.319">each time like I'm doing</span> <span data-start="2225.319" data-end="2229.249">here because it's a bit more simple the</span> <span data-start="2229.249" data-end="2232.19">second yeah you can just stick a game</span> <span data-start="2232.19" data-end="2234.349">note and sticking again now in front of</span> <span data-start="2234.349" data-end="2236.569">it is much more like the old analog</span> <span data-start="2236.569" data-end="2238.999">analog way of doing things so when you</span> <span data-start="2238.999" data-end="2241.67">have a voltage controlled amplifier as</span> <span data-start="2241.67" data-end="2244.579">it's called vca so we have two way of</span> <span data-start="2244.579" data-end="2246.529">doing things I picked one for this talk</span> <span data-start="2246.529" data-end="2255.41">really hello what is between this and</span> <span data-start="2255.41" data-end="2256.759">doing something like the cerrado</span> <span data-start="2256.759" data-end="2260.15">software in a browser hard work and</span> <span data-start="2260.15" data-end="2267.529">tears so serato for the people who know</span> <span data-start="2267.529" data-end="2270.049">we don't know about it is a thing where</span> <span data-start="2270.049" data-end="2273.199">you put like kind of fake vinyls and and</span> <span data-start="2273.199" data-end="2277.279">you can play mp3's and the vinyl yeah</span> <span data-start="2277.279" data-end="2278.779">you know the orientation the speed of</span> <span data-start="2278.779" data-end="2281.059">the vinyl on your turntable so you can</span> <span data-start="2281.059" data-end="2283.339">actually scratch with your mp3's right</span> <span data-start="2283.339" data-end="2287.66">so that's the idea about it so no it's</span> <span data-start="2287.66" data-end="2289.599">like I think is very much possible</span> <span data-start="2289.599" data-end="2293.269">people have done turntable applications</span> <span data-start="2293.269" data-end="2296.029">on the web before so if we if you</span> <span data-start="2296.029" data-end="2297.769">haven't even hit me up afterwards I can</span> <span data-start="2297.769" data-end="2300.38">give you some names is yeah it's kind of</span> <span data-start="2300.38" data-end="2302.809">working pretty nicely but yeah I mean</span> <span data-start="2302.809" data-end="2305.719">just work you need you need to do it</span> <span data-start="2305.719" data-end="2308.69">basically I'm making sense maybe you can</span> <span data-start="2308.69" data-end="2313.789">make the next era so on the web so the</span> <span data-start="2313.789"
