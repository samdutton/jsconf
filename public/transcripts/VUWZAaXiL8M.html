<p><span data-start="46.42" data-end="49.469">And this is probably not news to any of you all.</span> <span data-start="49.469" data-end="57.89">So my name is Amelia Abreu, and like Charlie graciously introduced me I am a design researcher,</span> <span data-start="57.89" data-end="61.97">and I've always been obsessed with categories.</span> <span data-start="61.97" data-end="69.84">I'm a Cuban American from Texas, who has lived in the northwest for most of my adult life,</span> <span data-start="69.84" data-end="75.42">so it's hard sometimes to answer the question, "Where are you from?"</span> <span data-start="75.42" data-end="82.51">And I would like to start out with a point that categories and distinctions matter and</span> <span data-start="82.51" data-end="92.78">this is probably not news to JS devs, after all language without classes, like requires</span> <span data-start="92.78" data-end="94.7">imposed classifications.</span> <span data-start="94.7" data-end="103.21">Yes, so today I'm going to talk about distinction and classification, why these little things</span> <span data-start="103.21" data-end="108.99">matter, share some of my notes and observations from working on development and security tools</span> <span data-start="108.99" data-end="114.91">over the past few years and make an argument that there's a lot at stake here and that</span> <span data-start="114.91" data-end="120.96">we can do better and we need to do better, from a useability standpoint I always say</span> <span data-start="120.96" data-end="134.469">that usability like security is best bigged in early on and as full stack JS reaches more</span> <span data-start="134.469" data-end="138.629">and more momentum, it's more important to think about this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="138.629" data-end="141.109">So who am I and why am I talking about this?</span> <span data-start="141.109" data-end="145.459">I'm a design researcher and I will speak a little bit about how I hate the word "user".</span> <span data-start="145.459" data-end="153.859">I would never describe anyone I respected as a user, but the term user experience seems</span> <span data-start="153.859" data-end="162.319">to have stuck to this area, and over the past few years I've been working more on security</span> <span data-start="162.319" data-end="168.79">and engineering tools, and as a result I've interviewed a lot of developers and worked</span> <span data-start="168.79" data-end="176.799">with a lot more, and I often find that my relationship to the Deaf community is a little</span> <span data-start="176.799" data-end="191.099">bit anthropological and prior to this I worked in Seattle and before that I was a librarian</span> <span data-start="191.099" data-end="197.449">and my first career was as a music writer, and when I look back on these various threads,</span> <span data-start="197.449" data-end="205.389">the thing that these all have in common is that they all involve listening to people</span> <span data-start="205.389" data-end="209.979">talk about complex and technical subjects.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="209.979" data-end="217.38">And this ongoing interaction with classification and systems.</span> <span data-start="217.38" data-end="224.819">I also want to note that something that has shaped me is that I am a child of the 1980s</span> <span data-start="224.819" data-end="226.349">Texas hardware boom.</span> <span data-start="226.349" data-end="231.099">My grandfather worked for Texas Instruments, my mother was a mainframe operator and neither</span> <span data-start="231.099" data-end="240.51">of these were glamorous jobs but they definitely shaped my understanding of how — the pecking</span> <span data-start="240.51" data-end="247.159">order of hardware and software and obviously we are living in a much different round these</span> <span data-start="247.159" data-end="249.319">days.</span> <span data-start="249.319" data-end="262.8">So first I am going to talk about distinction, and taste classifies, and it classifies the</span> <span data-start="262.8" data-end="264.72">classifier.</span> <span data-start="264.72" data-end="275.51">So there was a study on thousands of folks and it was found that their interests reflected</span> <span data-start="275.51" data-end="284.31">not only economic status but also cultural status so if you like Petula Clarke that puts</span> <span data-start="284.31" data-end="291.54">you at a very middle brow status but if you like shopping at the flea market that puts</span> <span data-start="291.54" data-end="301.52">you in this square of artistic producers and cultural capital, and this is something that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="301.52" data-end="311.37">I think we can think about in less of a stratified way but in a way of thinking: okay, the way</span> <span data-start="311.37" data-end="317.139">that we work, the way that we are, aesthetics matter and they say a lot about us Bordieu</span> <span data-start="317.139" data-end="324.81">also will matched this to the foods that we like to eat and then a gastronomic magazine</span> <span data-start="324.81" data-end="336.469">classified this so where your pickles come from says a lot about you.</span> <span data-start="336.469" data-end="343.159">So in the past few years I have been working a lot on developer tools and the term developer</span> <span data-start="343.159" data-end="352.79">experience has come about, and I like it okay because the word user, or as Laurel says "that</span> <span data-start="352.79" data-end="360.27">demeaning little word user", is not something you would use to describe someone you respected.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="360.27" data-end="369.53">I would call a friend's bad boyfriend, "Oh, he is a user", so how do we bring more of</span> <span data-start="369.53" data-end="375.06">that sense that we are working with folks to build tools that they can use, tools that</span> <span data-start="375.06" data-end="381.129">they will integrate into their everyday lives and everyday work, and that as developers</span> <span data-start="381.129" data-end="393.629">we will be using whatever is at our disposal to build better things for the end user, or</span> <span data-start="393.629" data-end="395.199">for someone else down the line?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="395.199" data-end="398.03">There's not really a good nomenclature for that.</span> <span data-start="398.03" data-end="405.129">If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to bring them to me after the presentation.</span> <span data-start="405.129" data-end="409.22">Yes, so how does one do this?</span> <span data-start="409.22" data-end="414.5">I find that this is something that is often mysterious.</span> <span data-start="414.5" data-end="421.31">I work a lot with ethnographic interviews which means I will bring the team that I'm</span> <span data-start="421.31" data-end="426.099">working with into the field to go hang out with the people who will use the products</span> <span data-start="426.099" data-end="431.509">that they are building, and I always say that I'm going to write a book about doing user</span> <span data-start="431.509" data-end="436.43">research that is asking dumb questions over and over.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.43" data-end="444.789">I will often ask people what seem like very obvious questions and then just listen, and</span> <span data-start="444.789" data-end="458.379">that takes a lot of humility and also patience but when we do come to users with little expectation</span> <span data-start="458.379" data-end="464.68">and little assumption, that's where we can learn the most about work patterns, about</span> <span data-start="464.68" data-end="467.62">needs, about work-arounds.</span> <span data-start="467.62" data-end="475.689">Yesterday's presentation — it blows my mind, it's blanking me because I'm jet lagged but</span> <span data-start="475.689" data-end="483.129">there was a really great explanation about work-arounds in a presentation yesterday that</span> <span data-start="483.129" data-end="487.199">I loved.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.199" data-end="496.229">And for devs it's often hard to distinguish between what about the users of your product</span> <span data-start="496.229" data-end="501.65">are going to be different than you and your team and I always like to start with this</span> <span data-start="501.65" data-end="504.77">question: well, what text editor do you use?</span> <span data-start="504.77" data-end="513.74">Because if you are using Emacs you will have different keyboard shortcutting and different</span> <span data-start="513.74" data-end="518.68">usage patterns than say someone using VIM.</span> <span data-start="518.68" data-end="528.69">And this is often an issue when it comes to developer tools because they often come out</span> <span data-start="528.69" data-end="530.87">of a roll your own solution.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.87" data-end="537.199">I automate something in my job; I share it with my boss; I share it with my team.</span> <span data-start="537.199" data-end="545.18">We say, "Oh, let's bring this to the greater public".</span> <span data-start="545.18" data-end="552.62">This onion you see here, this comes from a framework called cognitive work analysis which</span> <span data-start="552.62" data-end="562.19">was developed in the 50s to understand how pilots and nuclear power plant operators related</span> <span data-start="562.19" data-end="569.18">to their dashboards and negotiated their work and I like to call this the Homer Simpson</span> <span data-start="569.18" data-end="575.57">doughnut because at the end of the day we are all Homer Simpson trying to make sense</span> <span data-start="575.57" data-end="581.81">of something that's often complex, and not really designed for us, and you can see here</span> <span data-start="581.81" data-end="590.2">this was using the Python DES to better understand how they used the tools.</span> <span data-start="590.2" data-end="599.97">So I often work with — I work with fairly conventional hardware companies and software</span> <span data-start="599.97" data-end="607.48">companies and the idea of full stack JS makes them very nervous.</span> <span data-start="607.48" data-end="615.769">It's like, "Oh, the inmates are running the asylum", and as folks of the Node Foundation</span> <span data-start="615.769" data-end="627.09">like to say all 500 Fortune companies are running Node however this does disrupt long</span> <span data-start="627.09" data-end="636.589">held beliefs about web devs in this hardware-centric hierarchy of things.</span> <span data-start="636.589" data-end="644.259">Oftentimes when I go into the field and interview JS devs the way that they work is different</span> <span data-start="644.259" data-end="648.35">than say some folks working "closer to the metal".</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="648.35" data-end="656.639">I will tell you a little bit about the differences that I've found and this is based on qualitative</span> <span data-start="656.639" data-end="657.639">research.</span> <span data-start="657.639" data-end="665.959">I do not have large scale demographics to support this but this is something that I</span> <span data-start="665.959" data-end="672.519">would urge you all to think about, is thinking about where can we get, you know, collecting</span> <span data-start="672.519" data-end="681.98">more demographics about the backgrounds of your fellow JS devs and quantifying how this</span> <span data-start="681.98" data-end="692.39">is a more diverse and less conventional community than we might have previously ascribed to</span> <span data-start="692.39" data-end="696.2">software or server side development.</span> <span data-start="696.2" data-end="703.149">That's a first insight and it's probably not news to anyone here, is that, because there</span> <span data-start="703.149" data-end="710.63">is no one standard way to become a JavaScript developer, oftentimes JS devs will acknowledge</span> <span data-start="710.63" data-end="717.43">this plurality and often I will interview folks who work in teams together and they</span> <span data-start="717.43" data-end="725.11">will say, "Yes, like I do things totally different to him", and this is something that I find</span> <span data-start="725.11" data-end="732.269">that JS devs are far more comfortable with than some of their counterparts.</span> <span data-start="732.269" data-end="733.44">This is a strength.</span> <span data-start="733.44" data-end="739.62">I would argue that this is something that we want to acknowledge and see as a strength.</span> <span data-start="739.62" data-end="744.279">I think it makes for better products, a more diverse user base.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="744.279" data-end="751.66">I've also found, and this is something that seems a little bit wishy-washy but I want</span> <span data-start="751.66" data-end="759.959">you to bear with me, I found that, since many JS devs came of age during desktop-centric</span> <span data-start="759.959" data-end="765.19">frameworks but have since moved into mobile and Internet of Things projects, they have</span> <span data-start="765.19" data-end="773.639">a better conception of code living in the wild and living in the physical realm, and</span> <span data-start="773.639" data-end="777.94">I also find that a lot of the JS devs that I interview have interests in the physical</span> <span data-start="777.94" data-end="785.079">realm, whether they are knitters or skateboarders or mountain bikers, and this is something</span> <span data-start="785.079" data-end="793.85">that is seen not as anathematic to making software but something that complements it</span> <span data-start="793.85" data-end="803.86">and this is once again pushing back on the more immaterial sensibilities of the tradition,</span> <span data-start="803.86" data-end="808.87">you know, neck beard security developers that I work with.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="808.87" data-end="812.199">That term is used with respect.</span> <span data-start="812.199" data-end="824.93">The last and maybe most quantifiable and most important finding that I've made over the</span> <span data-start="824.93" data-end="833.98">past few years is that JS devs oftentimes coming from front end work have a better idea</span> <span data-start="833.98" data-end="842.27">of advocating for the end user and they often speak with a desire to help others.</span> <span data-start="842.27" data-end="848.68">I was working on a Internet of Things security tool this last year and one of the devs said</span> <span data-start="848.68" data-end="854.4">to me I don't want to make an insecure baby surveillance device.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="854.4" data-end="865.529">And this was very self-aware, I thought, and also very aware of the impact that one's work</span> <span data-start="865.529" data-end="872.31">had in the world, but we are at a crossroads here.</span> <span data-start="872.31" data-end="880.019">Having a desire to help others is not the same as actually helping others, and I find</span> <span data-start="880.019" data-end="887.519">that notions of advocacy are all well and good but they are often — there's often a</span> <span data-start="887.519" data-end="890.72">conflict about how to actually put those into action.</span> <span data-start="890.72" data-end="898.42">I often say that doing what I do, I often come to the table when things are already</span> <span data-start="898.42" data-end="902.85">on fire.</span> <span data-start="902.85" data-end="910.879">And my goal in the work that I do is helping you all to smell the smoke, because here's</span> <span data-start="910.879" data-end="916.86">the thing: I am very sick of empathy as a corporate buzz word.</span> <span data-start="916.86" data-end="922.8">Empathy for me is Bill Clinton saying, "I feel your pain", it's a gratifying thing to</span> <span data-start="922.8" data-end="934.759">dispense of and it's often, you know, rewarding to hear it, if someone empathises with you,</span> <span data-start="934.759" data-end="939.23">but empathy without action is pretty meaningless.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="939.23" data-end="945.06">So how do we build advocacy?</span> <span data-start="945.06" data-end="951.529">If you haven't run across this scene from the group Indigenous Action I would really</span> <span data-start="951.529" data-end="960.91">encourage it and I find that we need to think about our user or end users and the folks</span> <span data-start="960.91" data-end="966.149">that we work with as accomplices, not allies.</span> <span data-start="966.149" data-end="974.389">We want to be with them while they use the products that we build, and that we need — and</span> <span data-start="974.389" data-end="979.069">that in order to do that we need to build trust and consent.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="979.069" data-end="981.24">No one is going to let us in.</span> <span data-start="981.24" data-end="986.87">No one is going to trust us until we build that trust, and we build that trust by walking</span> <span data-start="986.87" data-end="995.4">alongside them, by acknowledging those diverse viewpoints and building meaning into our data</span> <span data-start="995.4" data-end="999.399">gathering.</span> </p>
