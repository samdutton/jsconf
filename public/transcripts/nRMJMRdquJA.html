<p><span data-start="2.51" data-end="6.18">can you all hear me okay all right oh</span> <span data-start="6.18" data-end="8.34">cool so my name is Nora Casper again I'm</span> <span data-start="8.34" data-end="11.25">here from Washington DC and my talk is</span> <span data-start="11.25" data-end="12.719">called empathy as a service supporting</span> <span data-start="12.719" data-end="14.82">mental health in the tech workplace and</span> <span data-start="14.82" data-end="16.56">I'm actually gonna save most of my self</span> <span data-start="16.56" data-end="18.21">introduction for the second part of the</span> <span data-start="18.21" data-end="19.8">talk I first want to cover some of the</span> <span data-start="19.8" data-end="21.81">statistics and definitions and things</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="23.16">like that related to mental health and</span> <span data-start="23.16" data-end="24.39">mental illness to make sure that we're</span> <span data-start="24.39" data-end="26.64">all kind of on the same page here</span> <span data-start="26.64" data-end="28.529">then I'll go more into my own story and</span> <span data-start="28.529" data-end="30.96">why this is so important to me but then</span> <span data-start="30.96" data-end="32.369">the bulk of the talk is really going to</span> <span data-start="32.369" data-end="34.92">be focused on things all of us can do in</span> <span data-start="34.92" data-end="37.92">our own workplaces and our own lives</span> <span data-start="37.92" data-end="40.53">common sense action-oriented things that</span> <span data-start="40.53" data-end="41.91">we can all put into action to support</span> <span data-start="41.91" data-end="44.25">mental health better and then there's a</span> <span data-start="44.25" data-end="45.75">short section on the end on things that</span> <span data-start="45.75" data-end="47.879">we all have to do together or</span> <span data-start="47.879" data-end="49.829">essentially it's it's more difficult and</span> <span data-start="49.829" data-end="51.48">more aspirational but still needs to be</span> <span data-start="51.48" data-end="55.26">done so first what are we talking about</span> <span data-start="55.26" data-end="57.51">so if there's anything that I want you</span> <span data-start="57.51" data-end="60.03">all to walk away from here with it's</span> <span data-start="60.03" data-end="62.16">this statistic it's that one in five</span> <span data-start="62.16" data-end="64.049">adults are living with mental illness at</span> <span data-start="64.049" data-end="66.84">any given time that's a huge number in</span> <span data-start="66.84" data-end="68.22">fact it basically means that mental</span> <span data-start="68.22" data-end="69.36">illness is one of the most prevalent</span> <span data-start="69.36" data-end="71.46">chronic health conditions but if you</span> <span data-start="71.46" data-end="73.2">think about it we really don't ever talk</span> <span data-start="73.2" data-end="74.54">about it</span> <span data-start="74.54" data-end="76.83">and to be clear when I say mental</span> <span data-start="76.83" data-end="78.689">illness I'm talking about any one of</span> <span data-start="78.689" data-end="81.9">these when some of these may you may</span> <span data-start="81.9" data-end="83.25">have heard of before some of these you</span> <span data-start="83.25" data-end="85.47">may not have another thing is there's</span> <span data-start="85.47" data-end="87.27">this phenomenon called comorbidities</span> <span data-start="87.27" data-end="88.829">which means that when you have one of</span> <span data-start="88.829" data-end="90.63">these illnesses it also often makes you</span> <span data-start="90.63" data-end="93">more prone to develop another illness so</span> <span data-start="93" data-end="94.77">for example depression and anxiety often</span> <span data-start="94.77" data-end="96.99">go together depression and substance use</span> <span data-start="96.99" data-end="99.57">disorder ADHD and anxiety often go</span> <span data-start="99.57" data-end="103.02">together etc to that I wanted to kind of</span> <span data-start="103.02" data-end="105.45">point out specifically our autism</span> <span data-start="105.45" data-end="109.2">spectrum disorders and burnout so autism</span> <span data-start="109.2" data-end="111.21">spectrum disorders are kind of part of</span> <span data-start="111.21" data-end="114.06">this bigger umbrella term of mental</span> <span data-start="114.06" data-end="116.549">disorders but they're often accompanied</span> <span data-start="116.549" data-end="118.02">by other things like learning</span> <span data-start="118.02" data-end="119.82">disabilities sometimes also physical</span> <span data-start="119.82" data-end="123.78">health issues and so they often require</span> <span data-start="123.78" data-end="125.189">their own kinds of treatments and</span> <span data-start="125.189" data-end="127.59">interventions etc so organizations that</span> <span data-start="127.59" data-end="129.959">focus on activism around mental health</span> <span data-start="129.959" data-end="132.48">often focus either on some of the rest</span> <span data-start="132.48" data-end="133.75">of these like depression and</span> <span data-start="133.75" data-end="136.12">xiety or autism spectrum disorder</span> <span data-start="136.12" data-end="137.71">specifically just because there was</span> <span data-start="137.71" data-end="140.95">required more specialized treatments and</span> <span data-start="140.95" data-end="142.48">so I'm not going to talk too much about</span> <span data-start="142.48" data-end="145.03">autism spectrum disorders today because</span> <span data-start="145.03" data-end="146.53">the organization that I work with is</span> <span data-start="146.53" data-end="148.15">focused more on the other kinds of</span> <span data-start="148.15" data-end="149.59">mental illnesses but there's still quite</span> <span data-start="149.59" data-end="151.42">a bit of overlap and a lot of what I'm</span> <span data-start="151.42" data-end="152.65">going to talk about is still relevant</span> <span data-start="152.65" data-end="155.23">for autism as well and then obviously</span> <span data-start="155.23" data-end="156.55">we're gonna be talking a lot about the</span> <span data-start="156.55" data-end="158.83">workplace so I wanted to call out the</span> <span data-start="158.83" data-end="161.74">idea of burnout especially in the United</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="161.74" data-end="164.62">States were where I come from when the</span> <span data-start="164.62" data-end="166.3">idea of burnout was introduced in the</span> <span data-start="166.3" data-end="168.27">1970s there was quite a bit of pushback</span> <span data-start="168.27" data-end="170.86">people said you know that's silly the</span> <span data-start="170.86" data-end="172.3">whole idea that you can get sick from</span> <span data-start="172.3" data-end="174.94">working too much so I did some research</span> <span data-start="174.94" data-end="177.07">and looked into you know where are we at</span> <span data-start="177.07" data-end="179.35">in 2018 what does the research nowadays</span> <span data-start="179.35" data-end="181.3">say and most psychologists actually</span> <span data-start="181.3" data-end="182.83">agreed that burnout is actually</span> <span data-start="182.83" data-end="185.05">depression they did a lot of studies</span> <span data-start="185.05" data-end="186.64">that show that at the end of the day on</span> <span data-start="186.64" data-end="187.93">when they control for all kinds of</span> <span data-start="187.93" data-end="189.64">factors the symptoms are essentially the</span> <span data-start="189.64" data-end="192.55">same but it is essentially depression</span> <span data-start="192.55" data-end="194.14">with a very specific cause which is</span> <span data-start="194.14" data-end="195.97">prolonged stress from working too much</span> <span data-start="195.97" data-end="198.4">so it's fine to continue to refer to it</span> <span data-start="198.4" data-end="199.51">as burnout we don't have to say</span> <span data-start="199.51" data-end="202">depression necessarily but I just</span> <span data-start="202" data-end="203.799">figured since we're gonna be talking</span> <span data-start="203.799" data-end="205.33">about the workplace that's an important</span> <span data-start="205.33" data-end="208.06">thing to know about but a big problem</span> <span data-start="208.06" data-end="210.25">with mental illness is that there's</span> <span data-start="210.25" data-end="212.2">often kind of preconceived notions about</span> <span data-start="212.2" data-end="214">what that means so if I say mental</span> <span data-start="214" data-end="216.19">illness to a random stranger chances are</span> <span data-start="216.19" data-end="217.239">they're gonna think of something like</span> <span data-start="217.239" data-end="220.9">schizophrenia but in fact depression in</span> <span data-start="220.9" data-end="223.15">particular is one of the most common</span> <span data-start="223.15" data-end="225.04">mental illnesses and it's at least 13</span> <span data-start="225.04" data-end="227.22">times more prevalent than schizophrenia</span> <span data-start="227.22" data-end="229.959">another big problem is there's lots of</span> <span data-start="229.959" data-end="231.79">misunderstandings about things like the</span> <span data-start="231.79" data-end="235.45">symptoms of depression so we often</span> <span data-start="235.45" data-end="237.489">associated with things like feelings of</span> <span data-start="237.489" data-end="240.16">sadness emptiness loss of interest and</span> <span data-start="240.16" data-end="242.62">pleasure in normal activities and</span> <span data-start="242.62" data-end="245.019">tiredness and lack of energy but there's</span> <span data-start="245.019" data-end="246.79">actually a whole spectrum of emotions</span> <span data-start="246.79" data-end="248.5">that's possible when you're suffering</span> <span data-start="248.5" data-end="250.06">from depression so it can also include</span> <span data-start="250.06" data-end="251.86">things like angry outbursts and</span> <span data-start="251.86" data-end="253.9">irritability any kind of sleep</span> <span data-start="253.9" data-end="255.73">disturbances which can be insomnia or</span> <span data-start="255.73" data-end="258.34">sleeping too much any kind of changes in</span> <span data-start="258.34" data-end="260.019">appetite and anxiety agitation or</span> <span data-start="260.019" data-end="262.27">restlessness and in fact one thing that</span> <span data-start="262.27" data-end="264.01">they're finding recently is that when</span> <span data-start="264.01" data-end="265.51">women experience depression they're much</span> <span data-start="265.51" data-end="267.55">more likely to experience the</span> <span data-start="267.55" data-end="269.11">of sadness and emptiness and loss of</span> <span data-start="269.11" data-end="270.129">interest and pleasure in normal</span> <span data-start="270.129" data-end="272.199">activities whereas one men experience</span> <span data-start="272.199" data-end="273.46">depression they're much more likely to</span> <span data-start="273.46" data-end="275.74">have symptoms like the angry outbursts</span> <span data-start="275.74" data-end="277.36">and irritability and anxiety agitation</span> <span data-start="277.36" data-end="279.879">and restlessness and so because we don't</span> <span data-start="279.879" data-end="281.68">often associate those with depression</span> <span data-start="281.68" data-end="283.84">men are more likely to not even realize</span> <span data-start="283.84" data-end="286.5">that they're suffering from depression</span> <span data-start="286.5" data-end="288.789">another problem with the depression in</span> <span data-start="288.789" data-end="290.319">particular is that we tend to shame</span> <span data-start="290.319" data-end="292.449">people for feeling this way and a lot of</span> <span data-start="292.449" data-end="295.78">people with depression or often say that</span> <span data-start="295.78" data-end="297.22">they'll hear things like I can't believe</span> <span data-start="297.22" data-end="299.259">you are feeling sad when kids in Africa</span> <span data-start="299.259" data-end="302.319">are starving and there's a report to</span> <span data-start="302.319" data-end="303.52">this that does its rounds on the</span> <span data-start="303.52" data-end="304.87">internet every couple of months that I</span> <span data-start="304.87" data-end="306.25">think is really powerful that says</span> <span data-start="306.25" data-end="308.11">telling someone not to be sad because</span> <span data-start="308.11" data-end="309.49">others have it worse is like telling</span> <span data-start="309.49" data-end="310.78">people they can't be happy because</span> <span data-start="310.78" data-end="314.86">others have it better another really</span> <span data-start="314.86" data-end="317.229">great illustration of the stigma against</span> <span data-start="317.229" data-end="318.94">mental illness is from this webcomic</span> <span data-start="318.94" data-end="320.099">called robot hugs</span> <span data-start="320.099"

data-end="325.96">treated like mental illness so just in</span> <span data-start="325.96" data-end="327.43">case you can't read the captions I'll</span> <span data-start="327.43" data-end="329.62">read them out loud on the left it says I</span> <span data-start="329.62" data-end="331">get that you have food poisoning at all</span> <span data-start="331" data-end="332.319">but you have to at least make an effort</span> <span data-start="332.319" data-end="334.93">on the right you just need to change</span> <span data-start="334.93" data-end="336.19">your frame of mind then you'll feel</span> <span data-start="336.19" data-end="337.44">better</span> <span data-start="337.44" data-end="340.03">have you tried you know not having the</span> <span data-start="340.03" data-end="342.729">flu I don't think it's healthy that you</span> <span data-start="342.729" data-end="344.259">have to take medication every day just</span> <span data-start="344.259" data-end="344.889">to feel normal</span> <span data-start="344.889" data-end="346.569">don't you worry that it's changing you</span> <span data-start="346.569" data-end="349.93">from who you really are it's like you're</span> <span data-start="349.93" data-end="350.77">not even trying</span> <span data-start="350.77" data-end="353.229">and while lying in bed obviously isn't</span> <span data-start="353.229" data-end="354.699">helping you you need to try something</span> <span data-start="354.699" data-end="358.36">else and all of the stigma and all of</span> <span data-start="358.36" data-end="359.74">the shame is a really big problem</span> <span data-start="359.74" data-end="361.02">because even in high-income countries</span> <span data-start="361.02" data-end="363.87">like Iceland and the United States</span> <span data-start="363.87" data-end="365.8">anywhere from thirty five to fifty</span> <span data-start="365.8" data-end="367.539">percent of people with mental

<span data-start="372.729" data-end="374.83">with severe depression 15 percent of</span> <span data-start="374.83" data-end="378.55">people end up dying by suicide so when</span> <span

data-end="382.56">reason they don't is because of fear</span> <span data-start="382.56" data-end="385.18">things like fear of dismissal fear of</span> <span data-start="385.18"

<p><span data-start="901.74" data-end="903.23">I've had a couple of friends recently</span> <span data-start="903.23" data-end="905.79">who I've started working completely</span> <span data-start="905.79" data-end="907.62">remotely and it's always been</span> <span data-start="907.62" data-end="908.699">interesting because the first couple</span> <span data-start="908.699" data-end="910.17">months of this kind there's this kind of</span> <span data-start="910.17" data-end="912.149">honeymoon phase where like they're like</span> <span data-start="912.149" data-end="914.52">this is amazing how why have I not been</span> <span data-start="914.52" data-end="916.529">doing this my entire life I love working</span> <span data-start="916.529" data-end="919.14">in my pajamas this is great but then</span> <span data-start="919.14" data-end="921.24">after about two months that honeymoon</span> <span data-start="921.24" data-end="923.13">phase kind of wears off and the sense of</span> <span data-start="923.13" data-end="925.32">isolation sets in and they start</span> <span data-start="925.32" data-end="926.76">complaining that they're feeling lonely</span> <span data-start="926.76" data-end="928.05">they're missing the watercooler</span> <span data-start="928.05" data-end="930.24">conversations the connections with their</span> <span data-start="930.24" data-end="934.71">their colleagues etc and along those</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="934.71" data-end="936.75">Lions in general working remotely can</span> <span data-start="936.75" data-end="937.8">make it harder to build strong</span> <span data-start="937.8" data-end="939.03">relationships with your co-workers</span> <span data-start="939.03" data-end="941.01">especially if you're the only one who's</span> <span data-start="941.01" data-end="942.81">remote and everyone else is on site</span> <span data-start="942.81" data-end="944.85">together and even if you're not</span> <span data-start="944.85" data-end="946.2">struggling with mental illness but you</span> <span data-start="946.2" data-end="947.61">just want to be a good supportive</span> <span data-start="947.61" data-end="949.17">colleague it can make it harder to tell</span> <span data-start="949.17" data-end="951">if everyone's doing okay if you're</span> <span data-start="951" data-end="952.98">mostly just communicating by slack and</span> <span data-start="952.98" data-end="955.8">the occasional Skype call and it can</span> <span data-start="955.8" data-end="957.06">also make it challenging to maintain a</span> <span data-start="957.06" data-end="958.53">work-life balance especially if you're</span> <span data-start="958.53" data-end="960.36">truly working from home and your home is</span> <span data-start="960.36" data-end="962.52">your office I've heard from a lot of</span> <span data-start="962.52" data-end="964.02">people that they just have difficulty</span> <span data-start="964.02" data-end="965.52">saying okay it's five o'clock I'm not</span> <span data-start="965.52" data-end="967.35">gonna respond to work emails and slack</span> <span data-start="967.35" data-end="970.82">anymore so some of the solutions</span> <span data-start="970.82" data-end="973.44">co-working spaces I think are excellent</span> <span data-start="973.44" data-end="977.1">and really undervalued and I think one</span> <span data-start="977.1" data-end="978.48">of the biggest barriers to people trying</span> <span data-start="978.48" data-end="979.95">it out is that there is often an</span> <span data-start="979.95" data-end="981.96">initiation fee or a monthly fee that you</span> <span data-start="981.96" data-end="984.39">have to pay so a good solution for this</span> <span data-start="984.39" data-end="986.28">is to have the company at the very least</span> <span data-start="986.28" data-end="987.87">pay for the first month so that that</span> <span data-start="987.87" data-end="989.55">person will be more likely to try it and</span> <span data-start="989.55" data-end="991.65">see if it's for them and to be clear</span> <span data-start="991.65" data-end="992.88">this is not something that you have to</span> <span data-start="992.88" data-end="994.23">do every day I've heard from a lot of</span> <span data-start="994.23" data-end="995.73">people that even if they just go into a</span> <span data-start="995.73" data-end="998.07">co-working space once a week it's still</span> <span data-start="998.07" data-end="999.45">helpful and makes them feel less</span> <span data-start="999.45" data-end="1000.91">isolated</span> <span data-start="1000.91" data-end="1003.68">also make sure you occasionally fly in</span> <span data-start="1003.68" data-end="1005.39">remote employees or hold company-wide</span> <span data-start="1005.39" data-end="1006.8">off sites to make sure like everyone</span> <span data-start="1006.8" data-end="1008.48">feels like they're part of the team and</span> <span data-start="1008.48" data-end="1009.85">they're getting a chance to bond</span> <span data-start="1009.85" data-end="1012.98">and finally there's just so much</span> <span data-start="1012.98" data-end="1014.69">research happening around remote work</span> <span data-start="1014.69" data-end="1016.4">culture and how to make it better that</span> <span data-start="1016.4" data-end="1018.05">there's so many resources that you can</span> <span data-start="1018.05" data-end="1019.67">leverage there's whole conferences</span> <span data-start="1019.67" data-end="1022.13">around this now so just look into kind</span> <span data-start="1022.13" data-end="1023.69">of what the latest kind of state of the</span> <span data-start="1023.69" data-end="1025.94">art around remote work is try some</span> <span data-start="1025.94" data-end="1027.32">things with your team if you find that</span> <span data-start="1027.32" data-end="1029.69">you're still struggling and see if it</span> <span data-start="1029.69" data-end="1031.01">works for you and if not try something</span> <span data-start="1031.01" data-end="1032.51">else there's there's just so many things</span> <span data-start="1032.51" data-end="1036.95">to try so the first time that I was</span> <span data-start="1036.95" data-end="1038.48">going to give this talk one of the</span> <span data-start="1038.48" data-end="1039.86">things that surprised me the most was</span> <span data-start="1039.86" data-end="1041.959">someone came back and said so what about</span> <span data-start="1041.959" data-end="1043.58">open-plan offices what are you planning</span> <span data-start="1043.58" data-end="1045.89">to say about that and I actually had not</span> <span data-start="1045.89" data-end="1048.86">planned on saying anything at all but so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1048.86" data-end="1050.69">I figured okay this is a good question</span> <span data-start="1050.69" data-end="1053.36">so let me do some research so on the</span> <span data-start="1053.36" data-end="1055.31">positive side they are more conducive to</span> <span data-start="1055.31" data-end="1057.23">collaboration kratom creative</span> <span data-start="1057.23" data-end="1058.55">problem-solving between multiple</span> <span data-start="1058.55" data-end="1060.62">employees people having more organic</span> <span data-start="1060.62" data-end="1062.42">conversations that lead to solutions</span> <span data-start="1062.42" data-end="1063.56">that no one had thought of on their own</span> <span data-start="1063.56" data-end="1065.84">etc I used to think that that's why</span> <span data-start="1065.84" data-end="1067.4">everyone did it but it turns out that</span> <span data-start="1067.4" data-end="1068.39">it's actually</span> <span data-start="1068.39" data-end="1069.71">because it's just easier to construct</span> <span data-start="1069.71" data-end="1071.36">offices that way because of things like</span> <span data-start="1071.36" data-end="1075.59">building fire codes it could also can</span> <span data-start="1075.59" data-end="1077.33">increase a sense of team unity or</span> <span data-start="1077.33" data-end="1078.95">camaraderie but I really want to</span> <span data-start="1078.95" data-end="1080.33">emphasize the can here because if</span> <span data-start="1080.33" data-end="1081.8">there's already friction on the team</span> <span data-start="1081.8" data-end="1083.06">then it can actually increase it</span> <span data-start="1083.06" data-end="1086.6">resentment instead but on the negative</span> <span data-start="1086.6" data-end="1087.89">side the number one complaint about</span> <span data-start="1087.89" data-end="1089.9">open-plan offices is the noise and how</span> <span data-start="1089.9" data-end="1092.93">it reduces productivity from a mental</span> <span data-start="1092.93" data-end="1094.58">health perspective I think the biggest</span> <span data-start="1094.58" data-end="1096.8">concern is the lack of privacy when I</span> <span data-start="1096.8" data-end="1098.9">talked about remote work before when I</span> <span data-start="1098.9" data-end="1100.67">said you know working from home makes it</span> <span data-start="1100.67" data-end="1102.62">easier to duck out in the afternoon for</span> <span data-start="1102.62" data-end="1104.84">your like therapy appointments this is</span> <span data-start="1104.84" data-end="1106.4">kind of the exact opposite right you're</span> <span data-start="1106.4" data-end="1108.86">working very closely with everyone so if</span> <span data-start="1108.86" data-end="1110.18">you need to duck out for the therapy</span> <span data-start="1110.18" data-end="1111.44">appointment everyone's going to know</span> <span data-start="1111.44" data-end="1114.41">about it people also have cited an</span> <span data-start="1114.41" data-end="1116.51">increased sense of stress and there's</span> <span data-start="1116.51" data-end="1118.94">also increased peer pressure and this is</span> <span data-start="1118.94" data-end="1120.77">a problem for mental health because I</span> <span data-start="1120.77" data-end="1122.63">think it's quite off it happens quite</span> <span data-start="1122.63" data-end="1124.04">often to us as developers where</span> <span data-start="1124.04" data-end="1125.9">sometimes we just get stuck and we</span> <span data-start="1125.9" data-end="1127.4">realized that the absolute best thing</span> <span data-start="1127.4" data-end="1129.47">that we can do for ourselves is just to</span> <span data-start="1129.47" data-end="1131.21">take a break for maybe like 20 minutes</span> <span data-start="1131.21" data-end="1133.01">go take a walk around the block do</span> <span data-start="1133.01" data-end="1135.14">something completely different but what</span> <span data-start="1135.14" data-end="1137">often happens in open-plan offices is</span> <span data-start="1137" data-end="1138.44">you look around and everyone else has</span> <span data-start="1138.44" data-end="1139.94">bent over their desks and they look</span> <span data-start="1139.94" data-end="1142.07">productive and what happens in that case</span> <span data-start="1142.07" data-end="1143.72">is you talk yourself out of taking that</span> <span data-start="1143.72" data-end="1146">break and that's actually the worst</span> <span data-start="1146" data-end="1147.44">possible thing that you can do for</span> <span data-start="1147.44" data-end="1150.32">yourself in that moment and finally</span> <span data-start="1150.32" data-end="1152.6">open-plan offices are are also highly</span> <span data-start="1152.6" data-end="1154.13">conducive to the spread of physical</span> <span data-start="1154.13" data-end="1157.82">disease like the cold the flu etc so</span> <span data-start="1157.82" data-end="1159.95">again I'm focusing on pragmatic</span> <span data-start="1159.95" data-end="1161.54">solutions so I love to come up here and</span> <span data-start="1161.54" data-end="1163.07">say we should not have open-plan offices</span> <span data-start="1163.07" data-end="1165.29">anymore but I think the vast majority of</span> <span data-start="1165.29" data-end="1167.12">us are not in the position to make that</span> <span data-start="1167.12" data-end="1170.21">call so then the next easiest and best</span> <span data-start="1170.21" data-end="1172.22">thing to do is to make sure that</span> <span data-start="1172.22" data-end="1174.68">everyone is allowed to work remotely or</span> <span data-start="1174.68" data-end="1176.96">if they are already maybe increase the</span> <span data-start="1176.96" data-end="1178.1">number of days per week or per month</span> <span data-start="1178.1" data-end="1181.25">when they can do so also regardless</span> <span data-start="1181.25" data-end="1182.9">always urge your employees to work from</span> <span data-start="1182.9" data-end="1184.7">home when they're sick don't have them</span> <span data-start="1184.7" data-end="1186.11">bring the cold or the flu into the</span> <span data-start="1186.11" data-end="1189.35">office maybe try setting aside small</span> <span data-start="1189.35" data-end="1191.9">meeting spaces for quiet work I work in</span> <span data-start="1191.9" data-end="1194.24">a pretty big office and I think for</span> <span data-start="1194.24" data-end="1196.16">those of us with big offices one thing</span> <span data-start="1196.16" data-end="1197.51">that happens is there's always that one</span> <span data-start="1197.51" data-end="1198.98">conference room that's actually too</span> <span data-start="1198.98" data-end="1201.56">small to have a productive meeting in so</span> <span data-start="1201.56" data-end="1202.47">maybe just that</span> <span data-start="1202.47" data-end="1204.929">one aside for people to check out for</span> <span data-start="1204.929" data-end="1206.429">like an hour if they realize that they</span> <span data-start="1206.429" data-end="1208.26">just need a bit of quiet time in the</span> <span data-start="1208.26" data-end="1209.64">afternoon where they can get some</span> <span data-start="1209.64" data-end="1213.38">productive work done also have the</span> <span data-start="1213.38" data-end="1215.34">company provide noise cancelling</span> <span data-start="1215.34" data-end="1216.87">headphones this is often the easiest</span> <span data-start="1216.87" data-end="1218.76">solution that everyone turns to first</span> <span data-start="1218.76" data-end="1220.95">and it does work pretty effectively and</span> <span data-start="1220.95" data-end="1222.63">then finally encourage employees to</span> <span data-start="1222.63" data-end="1224.309">decorate their workspace and this might</span> <span data-start="1224.309" data-end="1226.01">sound on the surface like it has nothing</span> <span data-start="1226.01" data-end="1230.49">to do with improving offices and</span> <span data-start="1230.49" data-end="1232.47">productivity at all but the research has</span> <span data-start="1232.47" data-end="1234.95">actually says the out the opposite</span> <span data-start="1234.95" data-end="1237.809">there was a 2014 study done in Sweden</span> <span data-start="1237.809" data-end="1239.58">where they tested out different office</span> <span data-start="1239.58" data-end="1242.22">configurations and they had their the</span> <span data-start="1242.22" data-end="1243.69">people who worked in them basically rate</span> <span data-start="1243.69" data-end="1245.19">how these office configurations made</span> <span data-start="1245.19" data-end="1247.38">them feel and the one that was rated the</span> <span data-start="1247.38" data-end="1249.39">worst interestingly enough especially</span> <span data-start="1249.39" data-end="1252.27">among men was the open-plan Flex office</span> <span data-start="1252.27" data-end="1253.83">which is an open plan office where no</span> <span data-start="1253.83" data-end="1256.35">one has their own desk and there was a</span> <span data-start="1256.35" data-end="1258.27">2010 study done that was done in the UK</span> <span data-start="1258.27" data-end="1259.74">where they compared people who had</span> <span data-start="1259.74" data-end="1261.51">decorated and personalized the workspace</span> <span data-start="1261.51" data-end="1262.86">and people who hadn't and they found</span> <span data-start="1262.86" data-end="1264.39">that the people who had decorated their</span> <span data-start="1264.39" data-end="1265.98">workspaces were actually one-third more</span> <span data-start="1265.98" data-end="1268.38">productive so as silly as it sounds</span> <span data-start="1268.38" data-end="1272.49">these life hacks actually work and then</span> <span data-start="1272.49" data-end="1274.86">alcohol tech events so this is kind of a</span> <span data-start="1274.86" data-end="1277.38">controversial one but let me go through</span> <span data-start="1277.38" data-end="1278.85">the kind of positives and negatives</span> <span data-start="1278.85" data-end="1281.52">first so one or two drinks can make it</span> <span data-start="1281.52" data-end="1283.02">easier for some introverts and those</span> <span data-start="1283.02" data-end="1284.58">with social anxiety to socialize with</span> <span data-start="1284.58" data-end="1286.049">their peers and I'm guilty of this</span> <span data-start="1286.049" data-end="1289.2">myself and the next one is a bit of a</span> <span data-start="1289.2" data-end="1290.85">positive negative but if you don't offer</span> <span data-start="1290.85" data-end="1292.409">alcohol than those who want to drink</span> <span data-start="1292.409" data-end="1294.36">will go to a bar instead of staying to</span> <span data-start="1294.36"
