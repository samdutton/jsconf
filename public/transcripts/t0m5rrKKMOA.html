<p><span data-start="363.46" data-end="369.83">So, why do for kids let's start with something easy.</span> <span data-start="369.83" data-end="375.889">We all can describe to a child how is more or less, right?</span> <span data-start="375.889" data-end="379.24">We can even tell how it works.</span> <span data-start="379.24" data-end="383.88">But when you press a play button on a video, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="383.88" data-end="385.67">What would you tell that kid?</span> <span data-start="385.67" data-end="387.24">It's hard for many of us.</span> <span data-start="387.24" data-end="389.94">It's like something is missing in school.</span> <span data-start="389.94" data-end="394.009">So, let's fix this for our children by teaching coding to kids.</span> <span data-start="394.009" data-end="396.61">The whole world is talking like that.</span> <span data-start="396.61" data-end="402.199">It's like people are concerned about the future of our kids or that we fear that technology</span> <span data-start="402.199" data-end="403.509">leaves us behind.</span> <span data-start="403.509" data-end="406.85">But no matter what, the command is the same.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="406.85" data-end="408.449">Our kids should learn coding.</span> <span data-start="408.449" data-end="409.949">This is justified.</span> <span data-start="409.949" data-end="412.99">I'm biased in this question for obvious reasons.</span> <span data-start="412.99" data-end="417.66">So, let's step back and take a look at the bigger picture.</span> <span data-start="417.66" data-end="422.81">We start by looking at the mechanic and apply the whole coding discussion on to it.</span> <span data-start="422.81" data-end="424.83">And it goes like this.</span> <span data-start="424.83" data-end="428.8">It's sort of like an obsession with being an auto mechanic.</span> <span data-start="428.8" data-end="431.37">There's tons of cars and there's tons of driving.</span> <span data-start="431.37" data-end="437.37">But I think it's a little silly and go and say that everyone should really learn to be</span> <span data-start="437.37" data-end="443.23">an auto mechanic just because cars are so essential to the functioning of our society.</span> <span data-start="443.23" data-end="444.23">Yeah.</span> <span data-start="444.23" data-end="446.29">It would be silly, indeed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="446.29" data-end="448.19">But what do we do?</span> <span data-start="448.19" data-end="453.27">There's tons of technology and we go around and tell everybody how important coding is.</span> <span data-start="453.27" data-end="455.53">So, are we silly, then?</span> <span data-start="455.53" data-end="459.509">Or are we just talking about something else than coding?</span> <span data-start="459.509" data-end="463.289">What if the word "Coding" is born out of confusion?</span> <span data-start="463.289" data-end="466.69">The question is, what do people actually mean with coding?</span> <span data-start="466.69" data-end="474.13">In 1943 Konrad Zuse built the famous Plankalkul and together with it, the very first programming</span> <span data-start="474.13" data-end="475.13">language.</span> <span data-start="475.13" data-end="478.3">It looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="478.3" data-end="481.449">And the technology escalated pretty quickly.</span> <span data-start="481.449" data-end="487.46">With this, you hold the device that combines everything we learned in the past 70 years.</span> <span data-start="487.46" data-end="489.259">That's a lot of very complex.</span> <span data-start="489.259" data-end="492.949">It makes computer science not easy to talk about.</span> <span data-start="492.949" data-end="499.37">Coding on the other side is easy, take someone at the keyboard and watch that person give</span> <span data-start="499.37" data-end="501.33">commands to the computer.</span> <span data-start="501.33" data-end="504.58">That's coding and people understand it.</span> <span data-start="504.58" data-end="508.8">If coding is such an easy word, maybe that's why it's mixed up.</span> <span data-start="508.8" data-end="515.469">Let's try a theory, when people talk about coding, they actually mean technology.</span> <span data-start="515.469" data-end="517.99">And people demand our kids not to learn coding.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.99" data-end="521.769">They're saying our kids need to learn technology.</span> <span data-start="521.769" data-end="525.389">And the whole coding discussion suddenly makes sense.</span> <span data-start="525.389" data-end="527.329">It's not about coding anymore.</span> <span data-start="527.329" data-end="531.569">It's about exposure to technology, computer science and programming.</span> <span data-start="531.569" data-end="536.07">So, kids can understand the bigger picture and the connecting lines.</span> <span data-start="536.07" data-end="539.319">Most of the kids will never be a coder anyway.</span> <span data-start="539.319" data-end="544.01">Our children should learn that smartphones and technology are not magical.</span> <span data-start="544.01" data-end="549.509">That there are limitations, benefits and possibilities for using them.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="549.509" data-end="551.5">Teaching coding still makes sense.</span> <span data-start="551.5" data-end="554.249">It's only one part of understanding technology.</span> <span data-start="554.249" data-end="558.029">But you benefit in many ways when you learn to code.</span> <span data-start="558.029" data-end="563.989">As a coder, you make the transition from being a consumer to a producer who can tell stories</span> <span data-start="563.989" data-end="567.259">and create your own worlds in the computer.</span> <span data-start="567.259" data-end="568.769">Coding stretches your mind.</span> <span data-start="568.769" data-end="573.3">And it creates a thinking which is useful in depends.</span> <span data-start="573.3" data-end="580.17">The room for creativity is endless like painting and music, but often more accessible and affordable.</span> <span data-start="580.17" data-end="582.97">And speaking of affordable, coding gives you chances.</span> <span data-start="582.97" data-end="590.97">Computers are cheap nowadays, poor children can afford it.</span> <span data-start="590.97" data-end="593.429">Everybody can become a coder today.</span> <span data-start="593.429" data-end="598.92">So, I hope I've convinced you by now why teaching coding matters.</span> <span data-start="598.92" data-end="603.41">Let me show you some possibilities how to teach coding.</span> <span data-start="603.41" data-end="609.16">I will present you now a list of my favorite tools I love to use when teaching.</span> <span data-start="609.16" data-end="613.709">It's about tinkering, robots and actual coding.</span> </p>
