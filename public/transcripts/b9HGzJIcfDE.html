of my</span> <span data-start="36.769" data-end="38.93">open-source projects the most popular of</span> <span data-start="38.93" data-end="40.879">which our prism tablet and prefix-free</span> <span

data-end="49.699">anyone heard about them before quite a</span> <span data-start="49.699" data-end="52.61">few people thank you so when I started</span> <span data-start="52.61" data-end="55.46">designing this talk I wanted to make to</span> <span data-start="55.46" data-end="57.5">design a creature that goes along with</span> <span data-start="57.5" data-end="60.17">it I kind of personify border-radius</span> <span data-start="60.17" data-end="61.67">and I thought how would border-radius</span> <span data-start="61.67" data-end="63.92">look if it was a cartoon character or</span> <span data-start="63.92" data-end="65.93">something like that and I I thought it</span> <span data-start="65.93" data-end="67.72">would look something like these</span> <span data-start="67.72" data-end="70.99">characters and children's books that</span> <span data-start="70.99" data-end="73.25">everybody thinks they're uncool and</span> <span data-start="73.25" data-end="75.5">nobody talks to them and everybody makes</span> <span data-start="75.5" data-end="76.729">fun of them because you know they're not</span> <span data-start="76.729" data-end="79.13">cool but they end up saving the day and</span> <span data-start="79.13" data-end="83.17">being the hero so that's what I pictured</span> <span data-start="83.17" data-end="86.71">you might find it amusing but maybe not</span> <span data-start="86.71" data-end="90.439">so when you first meet it border-radius</span> <span data-start="90.439" data-end="93.2">looks kind of like this you may have</span> <span data-start="93.2" data-end="97.579">seen it before I guess you have so there</span> <span data-start="97.579" data-end="101.6">is one value it controls how curved the</span> <span data-start="101.6" data-end="103.759">corners are basically the radius of the</span> <span data-start="103.759" data-end="107.6">semicircle at those corners and if you</span> <span data-start="107.6" data-end="109.189">increase the value that radius increases</span> <span data-start="109.189" data-end="112.219">and if you decrease it it decreases as</span> <span data-start="112.219" data-end="115.369">well and you might have heard about how</span> <span data-start="115.369" data-end="117.02">great its browser support is you don't</span> <span data-start="117.02" data-end="118.869">even need to use prefixes anymore</span> <span data-start="118.869" data-end="121.159">although I and you didn't you never</span> <span data-start="121.159" data-end="123.049">needed to use prefixes in operand ie</span> <span data-start="123.049" data-end="124.759">although I've seen monstrosities like</span> <span data-start="124.759" data-end="126.77">that like Oh border radius or m/s border</span> <span data-start="126.77" data-end="130.039">radius but those things never existed so</span> <span data-start="130.039" data-end="132.56">yeah that's all there is to it to border</span> <span data-start="132.56" data-end="134.84">radius like there's nothing else to know</span> <span data-start="134.84" data-end="135.29">about it</span> <span data-start="135.29" data-end="137.69">so thanks for coming enjoy your lunch</span> <span data-start="137.69" data-end="139.82">bye bye</span> <span data-start="139.82" data-end="142.65">wait a second I think I had more things</span> <span data-start="142.65" data-end="146.88">to say yeah cuz like if if that's all</span> <span data-start="146.88" data-end="148.77">what Irenaeus is about why does it need</span> <span data-start="148.77" data-end="150.63">six pages of the specification to</span> <span data-start="150.63" data-end="153.44">describe it it seems pretty simple right</span> <span data-start="153.44" data-end="156.57">so one thing is that you can have</span> <span data-start="156.57" data-end="157.71">different radius per corner I'm sure</span> <span data-start="157.71" data-end="160.92">most of you have seen that before so you</span> <span data-start="160.92" data-end="163.14">can have two three or four lengths if</span> <span data-start="163.14" data-end="164.85">you have one it controls the radius</span> <span data-start="164.85" data-end="169.77">where all corners if you have two the</span> <span data-start="169.77" data-end="172.05">first one controls the radius of the top</span> <span data-start="172.05" data-end="174.84">left and bottom right corner and the</span> <span data-start="174.84" data-end="177.39">second one controls the radius of the</span> <span data-start="177.39" data-end="179.37">top right and bottom left corner like</span> <span data-start="179.37" data-end="183.75">this you can have a third length that</span> <span data-start="183.75" data-end="187.08">controls the bottom right corner and if</span> <span data-start="187.08" data-end="191.46">you have four of them each controls its</span> <span data-start="191.46" data-end="196.29">own corner separately and they go in</span> <span data-start="196.29" data-end="198.24">clockwise order like everything in CSS</span> <span data-start="198.24" data-end="200.19">everything that accepts multiple lengths</span> <span data-start="200.19" data-end="202.08">in CSS goes in clockwise order not just</span> <span data-start="202.08" data-end="208.14">border-radius so to summarise when you</span> <span data-start="208.14" data-end="209.64">have two lengths they each correspond to</span> <span data-start="209.64" data-end="212.55">a different longhand property and why do</span> <span data-start="212.55" data-end="216.03">you need to use long hands they're quite</span> <span data-start="216.03" data-end="217.62">useful in case where you have something</span> <span data-start="217.62" data-end="224.25">like this so you only want to set one</span> <span data-start="224.25" data-end="228.9">corner to be different but using the</span> <span data-start="228.9" data-end="230.52">shorthand requires you to repeat the</span> <span data-start="230.52" data-end="233.73">value three times so it's much bird but</span> <span data-start="233.73" data-end="236.88">much better to use just this and use the</span> <span data-start="236.88" data-end="243.47">long hand like butter bottom left radius</span> <span data-start="243.47" data-end="248.31">zero so don't repeat yourself anything</span> <span data-start="248.31" data-end="249.99">you anything you code in CSS you'll</span> <span data-start="249.99" data-end="251.67">eventually have to change it at some</span> <span data-start="251.67" data-end="253.98">point so make it easier for your future</span> <span data-start="253.98" data-end="258.48">self so this summarizes how it works</span> <span data-start="258.48" data-end="260.76">when you have two values it corresponds</span> <span data-start="260.76" data-end="264.15">to two declarations if you have three</span> <span data-start="264.15" data-end="266.67">values the first one corresponds to just</span> <span data-start="266.67" data-end="269.01">one corner at the top left and the third</span> <span data-start="269.01" data-end="270.78">one as well and the second one</span> <span data-start="270.78" data-end="272.889">corresponds to two corners</span> <span data-start="272.889" data-end="275.439">the bottom the top right and the bottom</span> <span data-start="275.439" data-end="278.86">left and when you have four values each</span> <span data-start="278.86" data-end="282.219">one just sets one corner so I'm sure</span> <span data-start="282.219" data-end="284.289">many of you have heard that you can set</span> <span data-start="284.289" data-end="285.849">different values for a different</span> <span data-start="285.849" data-end="287.709">coordinates before so this is where</span> <span data-start="287.709" data-end="289.419">things started to get interesting</span> <span data-start="289.419" data-end="291.429">here we have a typical water radius</span> <span data-start="291.429" data-end="294.099">declaration for which sets the top-left</span> <span data-start="294.099" data-end="296.469">corner at 900 pixels and all the other</span> <span data-start="296.469" data-end="300.879">corners at 90 pixels it could be it</span> <span data-start="300.879" data-end="303.039">could look like this but for brevity is</span> <span data-start="303.039" data-end="307.719">it's like this so the dimensions of this</span> <span data-start="307.719" data-end="312.069">box basically I can just spell them out</span> <span data-start="312.069"

our</span> <span data-start="566.709" data-end="569.23">height if we reduce it we see what</span> <span data-start="569.23" data-end="572.17">happens and if we increase it we can't</span> <span

data-end="581.079">create an ellipse and that's because we</span> <span data-start="581.079" data-end="583.42">can't create an ellipse with what we've</span> <span data-start="583.42" data-end="584.92">already seen we need to use border</span> <span data-start="584.92" data-end="587.17">radius in different way so you can add a</span> <span data-start="587.17"
