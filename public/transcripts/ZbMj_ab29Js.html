<p><span data-start="349.72" data-end="357.16">In the interest of time, I'm going to hone in on the grammar, the innermost circle.</span> <span data-start="357.16" data-end="361.59">What is so special about this regular grammar?</span> <span data-start="361.59" data-end="367.8">In the process of converting a non terminal string into a terminal string, regular grammars</span> <span data-start="367.8" data-end="371.17">have no knowledge of the string's past states.</span> <span data-start="371.17" data-end="378.68">Once the regular grammar converts one non terminal symbol into a terminal symbol, the</span> <span data-start="378.68" data-end="385.74">grammar essentially forgets what the previous state of the string was.</span> <span data-start="385.74" data-end="391.59">We care about regular grammars because they are regular expressions.</span> <span data-start="391.59" data-end="398.75">I mentioned a slide ago that regular grammars retain no information about intermediate steps</span> <span data-start="398.75" data-end="402.33">in converting an input string into an output string.</span> <span data-start="402.33" data-end="408.28">So, what does that tells about the regular expression?</span> <span data-start="408.28" data-end="413.84">The forgetfulness of regular grammars implies that translations in one part of a string</span> <span data-start="413.84" data-end="419.34">do not impact how non terminals are translated in future steps.</span> <span data-start="419.34" data-end="424.43">This means that there's no coordination between the different parts of the string in creating</span> <span data-start="424.43" data-end="427.36">the output string.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.36" data-end="433.81">This gives us some insight into why programmers first brought regular expressions into code.</span> <span data-start="433.81" data-end="439.51">Because regular expressions convert input string to output string piece by piece, they're</span> <span data-start="439.51" data-end="442.59">wonderful at pattern matching.</span> <span data-start="442.59" data-end="448.13">In programming, regular expressions convert a pattern into the set of strings that match</span> <span data-start="448.13" data-end="450.21">that pattern.</span> <span data-start="450.21" data-end="455.34">So, in JavaScript, this is what the match method does.</span> <span data-start="455.34" data-end="460.01">It takes in a pattern, let's say it's called regX, like up here.</span> <span data-start="460.01" data-end="463.12">And this pattern is a regular expression.</span> <span data-start="463.12" data-end="469.96">And then match will find all sub strings of a string, which I've called S. And then match</span> <span data-start="469.96" data-end="475.27">sorry, it will find all sub strings that match that pattern within the string S.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="475.27" data-end="484.46">So, the linguistic origin of this programming concept that we know, regular expressions,</span> <span data-start="484.46" data-end="487.8">is starting to make a bit more sense now.</span> <span data-start="487.8" data-end="489.77">One question remains.</span> <span data-start="489.77" data-end="495.17">How else do regular expressions in programming relate to those that we've seen?</span> <span data-start="495.17" data-end="497.77">Linguistics thus far?</span> <span data-start="497.77" data-end="505.73">Well, I'll walk you through the similarities before their paths fork.</span> <span data-start="505.73" data-end="512.27">Regular expressions of linguistics and programming use the same three grammatical operations.</span> <span data-start="512.27" data-end="518.2">These operations are alternation, repetition and concatenation.</span> <span data-start="518.2" data-end="526.74">I'll talk you through what these three rules look like using both words and then some examples.</span> <span data-start="526.74" data-end="531.78">Alternation effectively gives us this logical or.</span> <span data-start="531.78" data-end="541.83">And I'm going to tell you a great story, a true story, about the 1920s when a lot of</span> <span data-start="541.83" data-end="546.42">Greeks were emigrating from Greece to the United States.</span> <span data-start="546.42" data-end="550.01">My family was one of those set of Greek people.</span> <span data-start="550.01" data-end="555.7">Given that my forebears didn't speak English, it was up to the immigration officials to</span> <span data-start="555.7" data-end="561.58">determine how their Greek surnames would be spelled using the alphabet that we use in</span> <span data-start="561.58" data-end="563.43">English.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="563.43" data-end="571.63">So, some of my relatives ended up with the surname Kafkes spelled with e s.</span> <span data-start="571.63" data-end="575.98">And then others ended up with the last name Kafkis spelled with i s.</span> <span data-start="575.98" data-end="585.24">Unless your family reunions turn into something like these cats, which are really aggressive,</span> <span data-start="585.24" data-end="595.15">don't want that to happen, I can use it to create spellings of the last name both ways,</span> <span data-start="595.15" data-end="600">pleasing everyone.</span> <span data-start="600" data-end="604.77">Now we're going to move on to repetition.</span> <span data-start="604.77" data-end="610.49">Repetition allows us to match an expression zero or more times.</span> <span data-start="610.49" data-end="614.65">Let's look at some bit strings in order to see repetition in action.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="614.65" data-end="616.45">All right.</span> <span data-start="616.45" data-end="622.38">So, I have this pattern right here and it is 01 star.</span> <span data-start="622.38" data-end="629.48">What 01 star will match is 0 plus followed by any number of 1s.</span> <span data-start="629.48" data-end="636.779">The star is a meta character, basically a short hand character and symbolizes one of</span> <span data-start="636.779" data-end="640.76">the many forms of repetition that you can use in JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="640.76" data-end="643.839">All right.</span> <span data-start="643.839" data-end="647.01">On to concatenation.</span> <span data-start="647.01" data-end="651.63">Concatenation joins expressions together in order to create new patterns.</span> <span data-start="651.63" data-end="659.01">I think that concatenation is pretty useful when we're trying to see how matching different</span> <span data-start="659.01" data-end="663.52">conjugations and tenses of English verbs look.</span> <span data-start="663.52" data-end="668.12">So, we have this regular expression right here.</span> <span data-start="668.12" data-end="669.12">It's call.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="669.12" data-end="673.98">Call will match many forms of its infinitive to call.</span> <span data-start="673.98" data-end="680.01">So, it will match call, calls, called, calling, all sorts of things.</span> <span data-start="680.01" data-end="687.711">But as soon as we add another letter, or another pattern, to that regular expression, only</span> <span data-start="687.711" data-end="689.71">calls will be matched.</span> <span data-start="689.71" data-end="691.79">So, yeah.</span> <span data-start="691.79" data-end="697.399">Now that we've talked through these examples of the rules that both engineers and linguists</span> <span data-start="697.399" data-end="704.83">use in terms of regular expressions, it's time to does how regular expressions in code</span> <span data-start="704.83" data-end="713.29">and JavaScript in particular differ from their linguistic predecessor.</span> <span data-start="713.29" data-end="717.72">Regular expressions in programming languages have two major add ons.</span> <span data-start="717.72" data-end="720.8">These are back references and quantifiers.</span> <span data-start="720.8" data-end="729.12">Once again, I'll talk you through these differences with some examples along the way.</span> <span data-start="729.12" data-end="738.13">Back references allow regular expressions to store these small patterns, or sub patterns.</span> <span data-start="738.13" data-end="742.8">Back references can be used to match all the laughing messages that you send your friends.</span> <span data-start="742.8" data-end="743.97">And I'll show you how.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="743.97" data-end="750.09">So, take, for example, the humble word "Ha."</span> <span data-start="750.09" data-end="755.73">The pattern above denotes" Ha" as a sub pattern using those parentheses.</span> <span data-start="755.73" data-end="761.35">And then references it using the backslash one short hand symbol.</span> <span data-start="761.35" data-end="766.31">This meta character tells us to match for the sub pattern again.</span> <span data-start="766.31" data-end="773.55">Then the star the end matches the second "Ha" repeated zero or more times.</span> <span data-start="773.55" data-end="781.04">So, to put it more simply, this pattern that I've written here matches the string" Ha"</span> <span data-start="781.04" data-end="783.49">repeated over and over again.</span> <span data-start="783.49" data-end="784.49">One or more times.</span> <span data-start="784.49" data-end="790.56">I mean, you can test it out if you want, but it might just look like this right now.</span> <span data-start="790.56" data-end="792.589">A little bit of forced laughter.</span> <span data-start="792.589" data-end="794.87">But yeah.</span> <span data-start="794.87" data-end="796.55">Cool.</span> <span data-start="796.55" data-end="802.55">So, some of you might notice something a bit more disturbing about back references.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="802.55" data-end="807.43">And it is that they go against the purpose of regular grammars as it's spelled out in</span> <span data-start="807.43" data-end="809.58">linguistics.</span> <span data-start="809.58" data-end="815.01">As a reminder, the purpose of regular grammars is not to obtain information about previous</span> <span data-start="815.01" data-end="818.75">states or previous places in the string.</span> <span data-start="818.75" data-end="825.24">So, despite the performance hit that this violation will cause, programmers enjoy having</span> <span data-start="825.24" data-end="831">a way to match repeated sub strings.</span> <span data-start="831" data-end="833.37">On to quantifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="833.37" data-end="837.81">Quantifiers alter the greediness of the regular expression matching.</span> <span data-start="837.81" data-end="840.18">What does greediness mean here?</span> <span data-start="840.18" data-end="851.1">Well, greediness is measured by the question, how much of that one thing do you want?</span> <span data-start="851.1" data-end="857.18">Let's look at the star, plus sign and question mark quantifiers for some examples in code.</span> <span data-start="857.18" data-end="859.41">All right.</span> <span data-start="859.41" data-end="863.89">We saw this example a bit earlier when I was discussing repetition.</span> <span data-start="863.89" data-end="872.81">If you'll remember, the pattern 01 star matches 0 and then 0 followed by any number of 1s.</span> <span data-start="872.81" data-end="878.89">The star quantifier matches the expression to which it is applied, which is the 1 here</span> <span data-start="878.89" data-end="880.81">zero or more times.</span> <span data-start="880.81" data-end="886.55">So, I can contrast this with the plus sign quantifier.</span> <span data-start="886.55" data-end="892.04">The plus sign quantifier matches the expression to which it is applied one or more times.</span> <span data-start="892.04" data-end="898.45">So, this means that from the previous slide we had zero as a possible match.</span> <span data-start="898.45" data-end="902.279">Whereas now we do not.</span> </p>
