<p><span data-start="24.4" data-end="29.4">Hi everyone, I'm Stefani this is Johannes we're both really happy to be here</span> <span data-start="29.4" data-end="33.79">today and more happy to see two awesome talks with still</span> <span data-start="33.79" data-end="37.3">enough energy for a third talk, also talking about</span> <span data-start="37.3" data-end="45.01">offline. So today we'd like to share our experience building an off line verification for our</span> <span data-start="45.01" data-end="53.61">clients. And this guy his name is Lucas, he's also a colleague of us, and a former project</span> <span data-start="53.61" data-end="59.32">member and we pack\h‑‑ we captured his priceless face when our client came to ask</span> <span data-start="59.32" data-end="66.93">us if we could build an offline verification. So we're all developers, and of course as</span> <span data-start="66.93" data-end="71.78">a developer when you hear about offline you think about oh, my gosh there's going to be</span> <span data-start="71.78" data-end="78.18">data conflicts how do we synchronize them, still data upgradeability and how do we even</span> <span data-start="78.18" data-end="85.189">test this? But, of course, we don't want to be overly dramatic, we like to solve some</span> <span data-start="85.189" data-end="91.32">challenges and we headed out there to have a look at the HTML5 storage technologies and</span> <span data-start="91.32" data-end="96.11">see what's out there for us, and then we thought maybe it's not a developer's nightmare maybe</span> <span data-start="96.11" data-end="103.32">it's a nice little challenge to solve. So before we step into talking about what we</span> <span data-start="103.32" data-end="109.46">did for our clients, we'd like to explore a bit what offline actually means for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="109.46" data-end="115.01">So for us offline is way more than the T‑Rex in a Chrome browser, it's not just having</span> <span data-start="115.01" data-end="121.12">no connection at all, it's also have a very poor internet connection, imagine going on</span> <span data-start="121.12" data-end="127.71">the tube and being connected via GPRS or just walking around and losing con flexion to one</span> <span data-start="127.71" data-end="133.12">router and have a little very short connection loses until you're connected to the next router</span> <span data-start="133.12" data-end="139.739">again. So when we talk about offline, that's all these scenarios that should cover all</span> <span data-start="139.739" data-end="145.599">these scenarios. And then you might ask yourself why? Why do we need to build anoffline capable</span> <span data-start="145.599" data-end="151.42">web application if we is have desktop applications or just have most of the time connections.</span> <span data-start="151.42" data-end="158.299">It was not just one client it was two that came and asked if we could build an offline</span> <span data-start="158.299" data-end="163.569">capable\h‑‑ that was the two case studies that we'd like to talk about today and share</span> <span data-start="163.569" data-end="170.409">experiences, so first of all it was M Morrison in the UK and they came to our colleagues</span> <span data-start="170.409" data-end="180.379">and they want God from paper base ordering to telebase ordering, the store managers had</span> <span data-start="180.379" data-end="185.409">a big bunch of papers walking around the store and checking how many products were still</span> <span data-start="185.409" data-end="191.45">in stock and they would update and place orders based on how many they had in stock, for that</span> <span data-start="191.45" data-end="197.689">they wanted to use tablets now. They didn't want to commit to a technology at first which</span> <span data-start="197.689" data-end="205.989">is why they wanted to build a HTML5 application. Why did they need offline. Super market is</span> <span data-start="205.989" data-end="213.159">not the best way to ensure WiFi connection, it's very big and they have very small connection</span> <span data-start="213.159" data-end="219.159">drops while walking around and losing connection to one router, and second of all they have</span> <span data-start="219.159" data-end="224.059">big metal shelves, which is also not very helpful with internet connection, and third</span> <span data-start="224.059" data-end="228.959">they also had that very big walk‑in freezers where they keep all the dairy products milk</span> <span data-start="228.959" data-end="235.76">and cheese. They're very good at keeping the cold in and good at keeping the WiFi out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="235.76" data-end="241.389">They needed something and it was more about robustness of their software while placing</span> <span data-start="241.389" data-end="247.419">orders in the store. And the second project we'd like to talk about today, that's the</span> <span data-start="247.419" data-end="255.199">project, the both of us are working on right now. It's about a big retail client in Germany</span> <span data-start="255.199" data-end="261.53">and they have that product the travel product testers, so what they do they specified the</span> <span data-start="261.53" data-end="268.46">products that they want to build and then usually one of a couple of their employees</span> <span data-start="268.46" data-end="274.919">take the specification and in the system with them and they go right to the manufacturer's</span> <span data-start="274.919" data-end="281.699">site and take products that they want to sell right off the production line, sample products,</span> <span data-start="281.699" data-end="288.659">they take pictures of them and see if they would fit what they specify in the the documentation</span> <span data-start="288.659" data-end="292.99">before. So they take pictures and notes and say if their products should be sold later</span> <span data-start="292.99" data-end="300.55">on and bought. For that, usually, they don't have WiFi connection at all in those manufacture</span> <span data-start="300.55" data-end="306.65">halls so they travel, they take the documents with them, they don't have\h‑‑ maybe don't</span> <span data-start="306.65" data-end="310.949">have internet connection for about two weeks, go back home and want to synchronize those</span> <span data-start="310.949" data-end="315.46">documents with the colleagues that have been working on at this time. So that's a the two</span> <span data-start="315.46" data-end="321.289">scenarios that we're going to talk about today and how we solve this. And you might ask yourself</span> <span data-start="321.289" data-end="328.4">how did we do this? Yeah, that's very nice question and we tried to put this into three</span> <span data-start="328.4" data-end="333.24">different steps that we wanted to\h‑‑ that we needed to solve in order to make our</span> <span data-start="333.24" data-end="339.289">application work offline. How do you get your client available offline? How do you install</span> <span data-start="339.289" data-end="344.43">your software in the browser? Then the data available offline, of course, and we already</span> <span data-start="344.43" data-end="353.009">heard a bit about this in Patricia's talk. And also data changes, how do we handle those</span> <span data-start="353.009" data-end="360.05">synchronization conflicts. Okay, so, let's start with getting the client</span> <span data-start="360.05" data-end="364.78">off line so client off line means getting your whole application off line, the whole</span> <span data-start="364.78" data-end="370.83">web application, all the CSS, all the images all the JavaScript and all the HTML, and there</span> <span data-start="370.83" data-end="377.84">are two technologies how to do that and the older one and a little bit the simpler one</span> <span data-start="377.84" data-end="383.139">application cache. Application cache works like this, you specify a manifest file in</span> <span data-start="383.139" data-end="391.319">your main HTML file. And this file says to my web application, I need this JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="391.319" data-end="397.219">these HTML files, this CSS files and then your browser will detect that, install that</span> <span data-start="397.219" data-end="405.9">into a separate form of cache and the next time your user will go to this very page and</span> <span data-start="405.9" data-end="409.629">independently if you're offline online it'll serve off of that cache rather than off the</span> <span data-start="409.629" data-end="416.28">internet. This works really fine if you're building a single page application, but it</span> <span data-start="416.28" data-end="420.919">has a lot of caveats when you're building a multi‑page application, also it's not</span> <span data-start="420.919" data-end="427.81">very flexible. There's one way it's working, and if this way is working for you, like it's</span> <span data-start="427.81" data-end="434.139">actually working for us, use application cache. If not there's a little bit more sophisticated</span> <span data-start="434.139" data-end="441.83">thing and this is called Service Worker. It's created buy a guy from Google named Jake Archibald.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="441.83" data-end="446.9">This is somewhat like a programmable cache. So you have this supervisors worker and it's</span> <span data-start="446.9" data-end="455.599">JavaScript file and it works in the background of any tab which is going to your domain so</span> <span data-start="455.599" data-end="460.729">independent of how many tabs are open it's just one Service Worker. And this Service</span> <span data-start="460.729" data-end="466.77">Worker is able to interject HTTP codes coming from your App. If you do a request, you will</span> <span data-start="466.77" data-end="471.169">go through the Service Worker and the Service Worker might go to the internet, if there's</span> <span data-start="471.169" data-end="477.479">internet, and just get all the stuff for you, and then, it can also put it into the cache.</span> <span data-start="477.479" data-end="482.939">The thing is, you program the thing yourself. So you can reroute stuff, you can read out</span> <span data-start="482.939" data-end="486.949">of the cache, you can invalidate the cache you're doing all of this yourself, rather</span> <span data-start="486.949" data-end="491.689">than the automatic model, which is the model you have with application cache. Depending</span> <span data-start="491.689" data-end="498.249">on what your needs are, chose one of them, application cache is a bit older, it's supported</span> <span data-start="498.249" data-end="505.449">on most modern browsers, Service Worker is only kind of ready in Chrome. So make your</span> <span data-start="505.449" data-end="512.86">choice and find something. Whoo we're already one third through, now</span> <span data-start="512.86" data-end="518.789">you may want to know how to get the data available offline. And, actually our colleague from</span> <span data-start="518.789" data-end="524.68">the UK, the Morrisson example they use web storage to store the data offline. There are</span> <span data-start="524.68" data-end="530.44">two version of web storage, local storage and web storage, very icy to use and very</span> <span data-start="530.44" data-end="536.99">nice. A big break through was when they thought in terms of\h‑‑ when they thought about</span> <span data-start="536.99" data-end="542.5">their updates in terms of commands, they knew I want to update this product with a quantity,</span> <span data-start="542.5" data-end="548.88">a product ID and I need to store nit a queue in case I get\h‑‑ in case I lose connection</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="548.88" data-end="554.69">I still have that available. For them they used local storage and it worked very fine.</span> <span data-start="554.69" data-end="561.26">In our project, we couldn't use local storage, basically for three reasons. First of all,</span> <span data-start="561.26" data-end="566.7">we're developing for Chrome only and in Chrome the local storage has only 5 MB and that was</span> <span data-start="566.7" data-end="574.62">simply not enough. Our users specification, big documents with tables text and images</span> <span data-start="574.62" data-end="581.14">in them. For us that was simply not enough space. And second of all, as you might have</span> <span data-start="581.14" data-end="588.03">guessed in next DB\h‑‑ I believe decked DB, we wanted queries, we wanted to know give</span> <span data-start="588.03" data-end="594.24">me some specification that has been written in that from date X to date Y so we wanted</span> <span data-start="594.24" data-end="602.09">to place those queries and that was also possible within index DB. Another thing was that actually</span> <span data-start="602.09" data-end="607.15">at the beginning we didn't use index DB we used local storage at a certain point our</span> <span data-start="607.15" data-end="612.97">data got messed up and we asked ourselves why. Until we released how our users use their</span> <span data-start="612.97" data-end="617.55">application, they opened our application in multiple tabs and working in them at the same</span> <span data-start="617.55" data-end="625.28">time. And then, they were all writing for the same storage and our data got messed up.</span> <span data-start="625.28" data-end="630.16">Therefore, we wanted something that gives us locking transaction, which index DB gives</span> <span data-start="630.16" data-end="637.67">us. Because with this scenario our single threaded JavaScript suddenly became multi‑threaded.</span> <span data-start="637.67" data-end="645.42">Yes, that's how we used it. And another interesting point, as we found, was migration, that was</span> <span data-start="645.42" data-end="650.92">something that we didn't really tackle from the beginning, and at some point we had to,</span> <span data-start="650.92" data-end="658.62">of course, index DB is Schemaless and we're running Java on the back end, there's no other</span> <span data-start="658.62" data-end="664.87">reason than the client wants it. They're both scheme maless, but we're having a Schema that</span> <span data-start="664.87" data-end="671.47">lives in our application, and we need to clean that up from time to time. So if we have migration</span> <span data-start="671.47" data-end="678.02">going on, of course migration number 42, first of all what we do when our context starts</span> <span data-start="678.02" data-end="686.47">we do my grate all the data on our Mongodb, as soon as the client connects, for us, with</span> <span data-start="686.47" data-end="691.31">application cache, we do have a new version then and ship them all an application code,</span> <span data-start="691.31" data-end="697.41">with this application we ship migrationjs file so the client can migrate it's own data</span> <span data-start="697.41" data-end="705.17">in the index DB. But one more interesting point is that we actually didn't want to write</span> <span data-start="705.17" data-end="710.73">the same migration code in JavaScript and Java, we wanted to share that kind of that</span> <span data-start="710.73" data-end="715.66">piece of business logic so therefore we used something called Naser. You may know it by</span> <span data-start="715.66" data-end="723">rhino, and that's a Java engine that lets you execute JavaScript in the back end, that</span> <span data-start="723" data-end="731.12">worked really fine for us. That was okay to set up and now works since we started doing</span> <span data-start="731.12" data-end="739.32">migrations. Yeah. Okay, finally how do you handle data changes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="739.32" data-end="745.31">Data changes can come in two different flavors, and interesting enough you can both solve</span> <span data-start="745.31" data-end="755.08">them with a gang of 4 pattern. Done for on the radio. One of them is the command pattern,</span> <span data-start="755.08" data-end="760.36">and the other one is the mow men toe pattern. And if you're lucky you can use the command</span> <span data-start="760.36" data-end="767.92">pattern, and that's what the people at Morrissons could use. So, how did they do it? Actually,</span> <span data-start="767.92" data-end="774.41">when someone is walking around the super market, they will, like, detect, oh, there's not enough</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="774.41" data-end="781.24">Museli at that place, I need to update that order so I get more Muslie. So they update</span> <span data-start="781.24" data-end="787.24">the order and they press a button, and by pressing that button they do an action. And</span> <span data-start="787.24" data-end="793.97">this action can be captured into an object. Which is then called the update order command.</span> <span data-start="793.97" data-end="799">So when you have those objects with an action you can get a sequence of the actions the</span> <span data-start="799" data-end="806.19">user does and you simply store them in a local storage. Or in "the" local storage in this</span> <span data-start="806.19" data-end="811.5">form. They just put them into local storage, when ever Annette connection is available,</span> <span data-start="811.5" data-end="817.31">they send the command over the wire and the server had a message processor where they</span> <span data-start="817.31" data-end="823.1">store the data into the database. It's not really relevant how the message processor</span> <span data-start="823.1" data-end="827.64">looks like, so either you apply the commands to your data and then you have like the end</span> <span data-start="827.64" data-end="832.24">state in your database or you store even the commands and you do events sourcing and only</span> <span data-start="832.24" data-end="838.37">apply the commands on read, but whatever you do, that's a pretty clean way to do synchronizations,</span> <span data-start="838.37" data-end="845.29">so when ever you have the chance in an application where you have distinct commands to do synchronization,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="845.29" data-end="850.37">I would try to use commands for that because it's pretty clean, the user has an idea if</span> <span data-start="850.37" data-end="855.32">a command fails because if you say hey, I couldn't update that order because there was</span> <span data-start="855.32" data-end="860.11">already someone else who update the order, they have a connection to the conflict. But</span> <span data-start="860.11" data-end="876.31">unfortunately, our users are writing documents, so our changes look rather like this. So our</span> <span data-start="876.31" data-end="883.07">users are not programmers so they don't know <div>es, there's really a hard way, they just</span> <span data-start="883.07" data-end="892.38">type ahead and every change done to the documents is like a letter typed. So this is simply</span> <span data-start="892.38" data-end="897.98">impossible to do with commands because the only type of command you would have is updated</span> <span data-start="897.98" data-end="901.61">document, update the document, update the document. So this is not something you can</span> <span data-start="901.61" data-end="910.35">work with. So how do you do that? You create kind of your chain sets, you do that by a</span> <span data-start="910.35" data-end="915.91">pattern called momento which works like I have a state of my document () and I remember</span> <span data-start="915.91" data-end="921.61">that (Momento) and five seconds later there's a new state of my document and I remember</span> <span data-start="921.61" data-end="927.5">that. And these states can be transferred. So, for us it's five second, it can be any</span> <span data-start="927.5" data-end="934.63">number. You have to chose what is fitting for you. How does that work? So first of all</span> <span data-start="934.63" data-end="942.13">the user types and when ever he types we're having an Angular application you can do it</span> <span data-start="942.13" data-end="947.06">with everything, it goes through a JavaScript component called Repository. This Repository</span> <span data-start="947.06" data-end="955.22">immediately writes into the indexDB so every key stroke the user dozeneds up in indexDB</span> <span data-start="955.22" data-end="962.88">like in one document like in the sequence of documents. And then Repository says, Hey</span> <span data-start="962.88" data-end="968.03">something change in the the database with this document and it tells this information</span> <span data-start="968.03" data-end="972.59">to another component also written in JavaScript called the queue, you can name it whatever</span> <span data-start="972.59" data-end="981.26">you want, we call it the queue. And this creates itself something in the indexDB which is like</span> <span data-start="981.26" data-end="987.8">saving the changes or documented the changes done to your database. And in this case, you</span> <span data-start="987.8" data-end="993.85">have an item, with the UID and it's in stage queued, it's waiting to be synchronized the</span> <span data-start="993.85" data-end="1000.35">changes in this together are waiting to be synchronized. We wait for five seconds after</span> <span data-start="1000.35" data-end="1006.95">these five seconds it will start sinking that document. So it will change the stage to insink,</span> <span data-start="1006.95" data-end="1012.1">so it knows this document is currently sinked, I should not sink it again, if the sinking</span> <span data-start="1012.1" data-end="1017.69">process takes longer than five seconds. And it tells the document Repository go ahead</span> <span data-start="1017.69" data-end="1021.16">and save that to the internet, because the queue doesn't know about the internet the</span> <span data-start="1021.16" data-end="1027.98">queue just knows about changes. And what happened is because sometimes the internet is slow</span> <span data-start="1027.98" data-end="1032.419">the user is still typing, there are still changes while on the other end someone is</span> <span data-start="1032.419" data-end="1039.049">sinking so it's just queuing it again. So it's queued and insink at the same time, and</span> <span data-start="1039.049" data-end="1046.549">the changes currently done will be synced with the five second cycle. That's all interestmenting,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1046.549" data-end="1054.02">I said five seconds. Five seconds is actually not that easy to detect if you have a business</span> <span data-start="1054.02" data-end="1059.15">application where users write documents and usually they have more than one document open.</span> <span data-start="1059.15" data-end="1066.47">More than one document means more than one engine accessing the database. And you don't</span> <span data-start="1066.47" data-end="1072.66">want to sync on all the that tabs you have, we were thinking how to do that, Service Worker</span> <span data-start="1072.66" data-end="1078.34">would be a good way to do it because you only have one per tab, another way to do it is</span> <span data-start="1078.34" data-end="1082.68">share web workers, because share web workers are like web workers just between all the</span> <span data-start="1082.68" data-end="1089.68">tabs. So we have a timer in our shared web worker which at random choses one tab and</span> <span data-start="1089.68" data-end="1097.03">you do the sync every five seconds the same it's just random. The other thing and Stefie</span> <span data-start="1097.03" data-end="1104.49">had nit the beginning on one of the slides, when are we actually off line? So don't go</span> <span data-start="1104.49" data-end="1109.38">for the navigator.offline property on your browser, because in Chrome it just tells you</span> <span data-start="1109.38" data-end="1114.64">you're connected to any internet that's not helping you. Are you connected to "the" internet</span> <span data-start="1114.64" data-end="1120.78">as a whole, but our servers down, that's alsooffline. Offline is when you can't connect to your</span> <span data-start="1120.78" data-end="1125.29">own back end, that's the definition we chose, and the users want to know when they're off</span> <span data-start="1125.29" data-end="1131.01">line, because it's important if their data is synced or not T shared web worker pings</span> <span data-start="1131.01" data-end="1136.51">our server, hey, are you still there, and the server responds, yes, yes, all the time</span> <span data-start="1136.51" data-end="1143.87">or not. The web worker will tell all the tabs, hey, you're offline or your online so the</span> <span data-start="1143.87" data-end="1149.77">user knows in every tab the state of the application and if it's currently thinking or not.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1149.77" data-end="1157.76">Yeah, let me quickly check the type. Yep. (Laughs) nice. So yeah, what is it now? Is</span> <span data-start="1157.76" data-end="1162.74">this building an offline capable verification a developer's nightmare or a nice little challenge</span> <span data-start="1162.74" data-end="1172.14">to solve. As a good consultant, I'm going to tell you that depends. But I can\h‑‑</span> <span data-start="1172.14" data-end="1176.17">we'd like to share you some questions that we asked ourselves that helped us to determine</span> <span data-start="1176.17" data-end="1181.48">what technology would fit best for our cases. And how we determined what it would be worth</span> <span data-start="1181.48" data-end="1187.71">spending time on or not. First of all it's the size of the data, for example the Morrison</span> <span data-start="1187.71" data-end="1193.27">example the local storage was enough for them. It's way easier to use something synchronous</span> <span data-start="1193.27" data-end="1201.21">than having to tale with the whole DB API, so the size of data matters, also the structure</span> <span data-start="1201.21" data-end="1208.84">of data we were really lucky that our data didn't have much dependencies, but if you</span> <span data-start="1208.84" data-end="1214.21">have a lot of dependencies in your data you might want to change to a different storage</span> <span data-start="1214.21" data-end="1218.77">technology. And it also makes sense that your storage technologies kind of matches, so we</span> <span data-start="1218.77" data-end="1224.6">used index DB and MongoDB it worked really well together, if you have to use relational</span> <span data-start="1224.6" data-end="1230.36">database you might want to think something else. There's something called web SQL, which</span> <span data-start="1230.36" data-end="1236.38">is deprecated and I don't have much experience in it, but that's maybe something you want</span> <span data-start="1236.38" data-end="1242.73">to consider. Another one is a potential for data conflicts, in both cases we're really</span> <span data-start="1242.73" data-end="1248.809">lucky our clients said data conflicts are not something that should occur often. Socially</span> <span data-start="1248.809" data-end="1256.01">the store managers update the products in the store only on their own, so there's no</span> <span data-start="1256.01" data-end="1260.98">two people standing in the same aisle and updating stuff. Also one person should work</span> <span data-start="1260.98" data-end="1267.66">on a document even though it can happen that two people work on the same one, but we should</span> <span data-start="1267.66" data-end="1275.18">only be able to detect the conflict and not have a sophisticated conflict resolution.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1275.18" data-end="1279.97">Which you could do here. We're on a level, we saw that we could show sophisticated <div></span> <span data-start="1279.97" data-end="1286.559">or even do auto personalling, browser support is a big one, our application was only supposed</span> <span data-start="1286.559" data-end="1294.84">to run in Chrome, so we were really lucky. That's not always the case, but there's some</span> <span data-start="1294.84" data-end="1300.24">technologies that are just not, not working or supported by old browsers. And the very</span> <span data-start="1300.24" data-end="1306.5">obvious one, but a very one that you should remember is the amount of functionality to</span> <span data-start="1306.5" data-end="1310.74">work offline. For both applications, not the full application worked offline, only the</span> <span data-start="1310.74" data-end="1318.42">core functionality that they really needed was working offline. Another thing is we're</span> <span data-start="1318.42" data-end="1325.12">now\h‑‑ we're now having users for about a year and there's some more challenges. We</span> <span data-start="1325.12" data-end="1328.96">only talked about the challenges that we had while implementing the software but not really</span> <span data-start="1328.96" data-end="1335.809">what happened when we went live in production. So there's still two challenges that are need</span> <span data-start="1335.809" data-end="1341.79">to be solved and one of them is the storage management. Our data's way too large to put</span> <span data-start="1341.79" data-end="1349.98">it all on the client side, so what to we do? What do we do when the our indexDB is full.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1349.98" data-end="1356.97">We already heard in Patricia's talk she had a slide where she visualized how Chrome manages</span> <span data-start="1356.97" data-end="1364.66">your storage so you get half of the available\h‑‑ oh she had a third of the available memory</span> <span data-start="1364.66" data-end="1369.94">that you have on your machine and therefore every application gets maximum of 20\hpercent.</span> <span data-start="1369.94" data-end="1375.22">So what does our user do when they travel for two weeks? Of course they sit in an airplane</span> <span data-start="1375.22" data-end="1380.39">for a very long time so they don't load a bunch of Dr.\hWho episodes and then there</span> <span data-start="1380.39" data-end="1384.77">machine is full, their available hard drive shrinks and therefore they don't have much</span> <span data-start="1384.77" data-end="1390.67">space to have those documents available offline. So this is still a challenge that we're trying</span> <span data-start="1390.67" data-end="1398.19">to solve. How do we make it easy for the users to decide when they want to have the documents</span> <span data-start="1398.19" data-end="1405.79">available offline and when can they be deleted and not just randomly let them delete by Chrome.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1405.79" data-end="1412.51">Another thing is local data versus non‑local data. Our users, as we saw before, have duplication</span> <span data-start="1412.51" data-end="1418.85">open in multiple tabs, so what they do is they start writing a document then switch</span> <span data-start="1418.85" data-end="1425.809">to another document and to another tab and want to search for what they just added immediately.</span> <span data-start="1425.809" data-end="1432.14">But as Johannes said before we have that five seconds delay until it synchronize was the</span> <span data-start="1432.14" data-end="1438.58">back end and a third is only place in the the back end. So it's kind of awkward for</span> <span data-start="1438.58" data-end="1444.1">them that they have to wait five seconds until they can search for what they just entered.</span> <span data-start="1444.1" data-end="1449.34">So, what we're thinking of right now is having actually a search that searches not only the</span> <span data-start="1449.34" data-end="1455.58">back end but also locally and then Americans those results together to give our users a</span> </p>
