data-end="1049.45">how libraries used to work in the back</span> <span data-start="1049.45" data-end="1052.81">in the days so let's do this instead and</span> <span data-start="1052.81" data-end="1055.06">i think i'll have to visit a different</span> <span data-start="1055.06" data-end="1057.34">file and reload this one yeah so now you</span> <span data-start="1057.34" data-end="1059.32">can see it has an exports if you</span> <span data-start="1059.32" data-end="1061.269">in here and further down it then puts</span> <span data-start="1061.269" data-end="1063.519">that exports on the window and and so</span> <span data-start="1063.519" data-end="1065.19">you can basically use it like this and</span> <span data-start="1065.19" data-end="1067.149">there's another really cool thing and</span> <span data-start="1067.149" data-end="1069.82">it's brand-new and it's called another</span> <span data-start="1069.82" data-end="1071.169">cool flex called nodejs</span> <span data-start="1071.169" data-end="1074.71">the nodejs flag turns this whole thing</span> <span data-start="1074.71" data-end="1083.44">into a a nodejs definition so that you</span> <span data-start="1083.44" data-end="1085.87">can just just use modular exports so you</span> <span data-start="1085.87" data-end="1089.5">can require the thing pretty cool it</span> <span data-start="1089.5" data-end="1092.23">runs a node I think I my example is</span> <span data-start="1092.23" data-end="1094.389">gonna be doesn't that I my examples</span> <span data-start="1094.389" data-end="1097.12">gonna be in in in the browser though we</span> <span data-start="1097.12" data-end="1098.86">can try out runs in node afterwards I'm</span> <span data-start="1098.86" data-end="1101.19">pretty sure it I don't know does it</span> <span data-start="1101.19" data-end="1104.889">anyway once no it gets were missing this</span> <span data-start="1104.889" data-end="1109">port it might I'm a browser person I</span> <span data-start="1109" data-end="1110.2">don't really know about it but this is</span> <span data-start="1110.2" data-end="1113.919">really nice I thought let's do no</span> <span data-start="1113.919" data-end="1121.179">modules then cool so now we we have hash</span> <span data-start="1121.179" data-end="1123.009">it out yes and we have defined in our</span> <span data-start="1123.009" data-end="1124.299">root directory and I showed you what it</span> <span data-start="1124.299" data-end="1125.649">contains and now we want to get the</span> <span data-start="1125.649" data-end="1127.539">stuff that's in there right so we want</span> <span data-start="1127.539" data-end="1130.45">to go into our app yes and now we have</span> <span data-start="1130.45" data-end="1132.7">to do a little bit of extra magic again</span> <span data-start="1132.7" data-end="1136.84">so we do an important this global I show</span> <span data-start="1136.84" data-end="1138.97">you how we have a global window object</span> <span data-start="1138.97" data-end="1140.83">now that contains hash so we're just</span> <span data-start="1140.83" data-end="1148.12">going to do it was a equals was fine Jen</span> <span data-start="1148.12" data-end="1150.789">which is how we import our hash function</span> <span data-start="1150.789" data-end="1155.47">and then this is a bit annoying still</span> <span data-start="1155.47" data-end="1157.629">but people are working on it we call as</span> <span data-start="1157.629" data-end="1160.21">and bind Jen on the wisemen file that we</span> <span data-start="1160.21" data-end="1164.559">have in this case hash or bheegi bheegi</span> <span data-start="1164.559" data-end="1168.84">azam and that will asynchronously</span> <span data-start="1168.84" data-end="1171.97">initiate the whole last thing and fetch</span> <span data-start="1171.97" data-end="1174.7">it and load it in whatever so this thing</span> <span data-start="1174.7" data-end="1177.039">returns a promise in this case it works</span> <span data-start="1177.039" data-end="1178.96">because my button is also a</span> <span data-start="1178.96" data-end="1180.789">synchronously listening for user input</span> <span data-start="1180.789" data-end="1182.049">so this thing's got definitely gonna</span> <span data-start="1182.049" data-end="1183.309">finish before my user clicks on</span> <span data-start="1183.309" data-end="1187.149">calculate when you have an app that does</span> <span data-start="1187.149" data-end="1189.309">stuff that is supposed to run wasm</span> <span data-start="1189.309" data-end="1192.1">before like it like instantly</span> <span data-start="1192.1" data-end="1193.09">synchronously</span> <span data-start="1193.09" data-end="1195.94">you need to you know await this or do</span> <span data-start="1195.94" data-end="1200.65">promise and do then run my or something</span> <span data-start="1200.65" data-end="1202.33">like this in this case I'm just gonna</span> <span data-start="1202.33" data-end="1203.47">it's gonna be fine</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1203.47" data-end="1207.37">I hope let's do a yeah it's finally do</span> <span data-start="1207.37" data-end="1214.09">some demo hash input value and now we</span> <span data-start="1214.09" data-end="1219.1">can see I hope that we have Oh hasn't</span> <span data-start="1219.1" data-end="1220.36">been Jen's not defined can anyone guess</span> <span data-start="1220.36" data-end="1223.99">why so the sorry that was pretty quick</span> <span data-start="1223.99" data-end="1227.56">the errors here there is wasn't binding</span> <span data-start="1227.56" data-end="1228.46">is not defined</span> <span data-start="1228.46" data-end="1232.45">do you have time also the problem is</span> <span data-start="1232.45" data-end="1237.09">that we did not put it in our HTML file</span> <span data-start="1237.09" data-end="1241.6">so half of Dolce s is a script that you</span> <span data-start="1241.6" data-end="1245.2">need to put in your in your includes or</span> <span data-start="1245.2" data-end="1247.27">just bundle it somehow and get it on</span> <span data-start="1247.27" data-end="1250.54">your window global now to run</span> </p>

data-start="1259.96" data-end="1263.95">cool but it's not a hash yet so now I</span> <span data-start="1263.95" data-end="1265.78">hope the even cooler stuff starts where</span> <span data-start="1265.78" data-end="1268.15">we just include a Russ module just like</span> <span data-start="1268.15" data-end="1268.93">that and compiler</span> <span data-start="1268.93" data-end="1272.44">2002 and run so what are we gonna use</span> <span data-start="1272.44" data-end="1274.75">we're gonna use a I just you know look</span> <span data-start="1274.75" data-end="1276.07">this up in advance of course we can use</span> <span data-start="1276.07" data-end="1280.03">a crate arrest module called chat to I I</span> <span data-start="1280.03"
