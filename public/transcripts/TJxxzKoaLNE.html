data-end="643.09">columns and they can even be nested so</span> <span data-start="643.09" data-end="644.74">you can have a frame set inside of a</span> <span data-start="644.74"

says that the column in this</span> <span data-start="652.36" data-end="654.76">case will take up the remainder of the</span> <span data-start="654.76" data-end="657.34">space which is actually pretty fancy for</span> <span data-start="657.34" data-end="658.48">20 years</span> <span data-start="658.48" data-end="660.91">ago right that it could just be fluid</span> <span data-start="660.91" data-end="663.4">that way and of course there's visual</span> <span data-start="663.4" data-end="666.73">styling that's mixed up in the markup as</span> <span data-start="666.73" data-end="671.2">well so frames by default had borders</span> <span data-start="671.2" data-end="674.17">around them so you could add frame</span> <span data-start="674.17" data-end="677.41">border zero to turn off the frames that</span> <span data-start="677.41" data-end="682.09">way but if you left on the borders the</span> <span data-start="682.09" data-end="684.07">border the borders could be dragged and</span> <span data-start="684.07" data-end="686.32">resized so you could turn off that</span> <span data-start="686.32" data-end="688.57">attribute with the no resize attribute</span> <span data-start="688.57" data-end="692.2">there to prevent resizing and and then</span> <span data-start="692.2" data-end="694.15">last but not least we have this</span> <span data-start="694.15" data-end="697.09">this name attribute they're like what</span> <span data-start="697.09" data-end="699.04">exactly is the name attribute for it's</span> <span data-start="699.04"

data-start="722.95" data-end="726.13">inside of the nav we were able to say</span> <span data-start="726.13" data-end="728.23">when I click on something that the</span> <span data-start="728.23" data-end="730.84">content would actually change so we're</span> <span data-start="730.84" data-end="732.85">always all used to saying you know</span> <span data-start="732.85" data-end="735.55">target

<span data-start="742.45" data-end="744.04">there were other reasons to use the</span> <span data-start="744.04" data-end="746.08">target attribute and that was the target</span> <span data-start="746.08" data-end="748.6">other frames in order to update their</span> <span data-start="748.6" data-end="750.91">content so in this case when you click</span> <span data-start="750.91" data-end="753.25">on the link the main content would</span> <span data-start="753.25" data-end="755.94">update with whatever link we had and</span> <span data-start="755.94" data-end="760.18">also for some reason the Allies weren't</span> <span data-start="760.18" data-end="761.86">closed then either maybe that's</span> <span data-start="761.86" data-end="763.48">something we did or something I did I</span> <span data-start="763.48" data-end="766.54">don't know but Li tags were just open</span> <span data-start="766.54" data-end="771.25">and by the way frame set was deprecated</span> <span data-start="771.25" data-end="774.16">in html5 so it's not something we can</span> <span data-start="774.16" data-end="776.83">use anymore but all the browser still</span> <span data-start="776.83" data-end="779.86">seem to support it so I guess you could</span> <span data-start="779.86" data-end="784.15">go off in and go old-school now but if</span> <span data-start="784.15" data-end="785.53">you've been able if you've been keeping</span> <span data-start="785.53" data-end="787.54">up with everything going on in CSS land</span> <span data-start="787.54" data-end="789.91">right what I just described sounds very</span> <span data-start="789.91" data-end="792.76">similar to CSS grid which Rachel showed</span> <span data-start="792.76" data-end="795.73">us earlier and we can basically</span> <span data-start="795.73" data-end="798.43">accomplish the same thing with frame</span> <span data-start="798.43" data-end="801.37">sets as we can with CSS grid with this</span> <span data-start="801.37" data-end="803.95">code here so I'm not going to go through</span> <span data-start="803.95" data-end="805.45">the code that's not really the purpose</span> <span data-start="805.45" data-end="807.79">of this but you know notice how the the</span> <span data-start="807.79" data-end="810.34">main tag is actually above the nav tag</span> <span data-start="810.34" data-end="813.85">so that's for SEO purposes of course so</span> <span data-start="813.85" data-end="815.86">that the main content which is more</span> <span data-start="815.86" data-end="818.17">important can show up first but then the</span> <span data-start="818.17" data-end="820.06">grid layout allows us to put things</span> <span data-start="820.06" data-end="822.88">wherever we want whether it's small</span> <span data-start="822.88" data-end="824.62">screen large screen so that it can</span> <span data-start="824.62" data-end="829.15">display the way that we like it okay but</span> <span data-start="829.15" data-end="831.85">you know what CSS grid it's way way way</span> <span data-start="831.85" data-end="834.07">too modern for us so let's go let's go</span> <span data-start="834.07" data-end="835.33">back to decades</span> <span data-start="835.33" data-end="838.87">again okay so let's say we have this</span> <span data-start="838.87" data-end="841.06">schedule right that's the schedule for</span> <span data-start="841.06" data-end="844.81">the CSS coffee you to 2019 schedule</span> <span data-start="844.81" data-end="847.96">today and like all we want to do is just</span> <span data-start="847.96" data-end="851.17">indent the name of the speaker 40 pixels</span> <span data-start="851.17" data-end="854.29">in from the left so naturally we would</span> <span data-start="854.29" data-end="857.2">use some CSS selector like margin left</span> <span data-start="857.2" data-end="859.87">40 pixels or padding left 40 pixels or</span> <span data-start="859.87" data-end="861.94">whatever the case may be we have so much</span> <span data-start="861.94" data-end="864.49">at CSS at our disposal to be able to</span> <span data-start="864.49" data-end="866.35">make it happen so it's simple enough</span> <span data-start="866.35" data-end="866.62">right</span> <span data-start="866.62" data-end="869.38">or maybe we would use bootstrap of grid</span> <span data-start="869.38" data-end="871.39">system and we would burn a left column</span> <span data-start="871.39" data-end="873.37">or something sophisticated like that but</span> <span data-start="873.37" data-end="877.27">we would leverage CSS but what do you do</span> <span data-start="877.27" data-end="881.05">what do you use when CSS doesn't exist</span> <span data-start="881.05" data-end="883.81">yet or at the very least you're not sure</span> <span data-start="883.81" data-end="885.76">that CSS is going to exist in all the</span> <span data-start="885.76" data-end="889.03">browsers where your sites gonna be well</span> <span data-start="889.03" data-end="893.68">you would use a 1x1 gif and also known</span> <span data-start="893.68" data-end="895.15">as a spacer gif</span> <span data-start="895.15" data-end="898.84">yes and I say gif not Jeff okay so if</span> <span data-start="898.84" data-end="902.35">you say jiff too bad but what it was it</span> <span data-start="902.35" data-end="904.57">was like it was this hundred percent</span> <span data-start="904.57" data-end="908.2">transparent see-through image okay and</span> <span data-start="908.2" data-end="909.79">it was teeny in size because it is</span> <span data-start="909.79" data-end="913.51">actually 1x1 pixels and we used it to</span> <span data-start="913.51" data-end="916.51">create our pixel perfect spacing and our</span> <span data-start="916.51" data-end="919.69">pixel perfect layouts before CSS existed</span> <span data-start="919.69" data-end="922.63">so it could work in the horizontal or</span> <span data-start="922.63" data-end="924.82">vertical direction you would just take</span> <span data-start="924.82" data-end="925.18">the</span> <span data-start="925.18" data-end="927.49">give it a whiff or give it a height or</span> <span data-start="927.49" data-end="929.53">give it both and you're able to space</span> <span data-start="929.53" data-end="931.84">things and give things margins and</span> <span data-start="931.84" data-end="935.11">padding's and separate things however</span> <span data-start="935.11" data-end="937.78">you wanted and we used them like all</span> <span data-start="937.78" data-end="940.12">over the place all over the place and</span> <span data-start="940.12" data-end="942.1">again a responsive design wasn't a thing</span> <span data-start="942.1" data-end="944.05">at this time so we were just designing</span> <span data-start="944.05" data-end="947.26">for like one screen width or whatever so</span> <span data-start="947.26" data-end="948.94">we didn't have to worry about mobile so</span> <span data-start="948.94" data-end="953.4">we would just use 1x1 pixels everywhere</span> <span data-start="953.4" data-end="957.07">and for this you know maybe you could</span> <span data-start="957.07" data-end="958.63">throw a whole bunch of non-breaking</span> <span data-start="958.63" data-end="961.09">spaces as well which I totally did</span> <span data-start="961.09" data-end="963.94">number of times as well</span> <span data-start="963.94" data-end="965.95">but for this specific case you know</span> <span data-start="965.95" data-end="967.75">spacing with non-breaking spaces</span> <span data-start="967.75" data-end="970.69">depending on the font and the font size</span> <span data-start="970.69" data-end="973.84">so things may not line up exactly how</span> <span data-start="973.84" data-end="976.33">you would want to use them so spacer</span> <span data-start="976.33" data-end="980.16">gifts were definitely at our disposal</span> <span data-start="980.16" data-end="983.2">okay and then CSS became a thing which</span> <span data-start="983.2" data-end="985.24">was great so we're talking early 2000s</span> <span data-start="985.24" data-end="987.64">great we have some CSS we can use it</span> <span data-start="987.64" data-end="990.91">you've got HTML and we have CSS this is</span> <span data-start="990.91" data-end="994.39">gonna be awesome so what could we do so</span> <span data-start="994.39" data-end="996.73">no longer did we have to put text or</span> <span data-start="996.73" data-end="998.83">link or background colors on the body</span> <span data-start="998.83" data-end="1001.8">tag anymore or no longer do we have to</span> <span data-start="1001.8" data-end="1004.52">use the font tag for styling everything</span> <span data-start="1004.52" data-end="1007.38">like the font tag is like obsolete it's</span> <span data-start="1007.38" data-end="1009.24">not deprecated it's just like gone from</span> <span data-start="1009.24" data-end="1011.58">the browser's now and I definitely use</span> <span data-start="1011.58" data-end="1013.65">the font tag like everywhere I want it</span> <span data-start="1013.65" data-end="1015.12">to style something I want to make</span> <span data-start="1015.12"

data-end="1026.28">font tags didn't use spans always font</span> <span data-start="1026.28" data-end="1030.48">tags so we do have to do that anymore we</span> <span data-start="1030.48" data-end="1032.339">were still using tables obviously for</span> <span data-start="1032.339" data-end="1035.7">layouts of course but no longer did we</span> <span data-start="1035.7" data-end="1037.53">have to have the styling for the table</span> <span data-start="1037.53" data-end="1040.83">in the markup anymore we could put it in</span> <span data-start="1040.83"
