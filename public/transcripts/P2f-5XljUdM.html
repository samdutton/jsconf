data-end="1824.57">these interesting things to happen which</span> <span data-start="1824.57" data-end="1827.03">is that like 10th for example is now</span> <span data-start="1827.03"

data-end="1857.57">in people have sort of an interest in</span> <span data-start="1857.57" data-end="1858.86">graffiti there's sort of a pop culture</span> <span data-start="1858.86" data-end="1860.69">reference there and so I'm using this as</span> <span data-start="1860.69" data-end="1863.21">a way to get people even though even if</span> <span data-start="1863.21"
