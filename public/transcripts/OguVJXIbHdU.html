<p><span data-start="106.189" data-end="110.409">You may be smarter than me but I use browser extensions all the time and had no idea how</span> <span data-start="110.409" data-end="112.999">they worked until I started building one.</span> <span data-start="112.999" data-end="115.479">It turns out they are pretty straightforward.</span> <span data-start="115.479" data-end="118.999">A browser extension or a plugin is just a small piece of software that runs inside the</span> <span data-start="118.999" data-end="119.999">browser.</span> <span data-start="119.999" data-end="128.16">My extensions are built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</span> <span data-start="128.16" data-end="135.84">There is a standardized web extension backed by the W3C.</span> <span data-start="135.84" data-end="154.2">Safari and Internet Explorer use different extensions so it</span> <span data-start="154.2" data-end="155.58">is difficult with them.</span> <span data-start="155.58" data-end="159.83">The question you should be asking here is what can't a browser extension do because</span> <span data-start="159.83" data-end="162.05">these things are crazy powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="162.05" data-end="166.04">Frankly, it is kind of terrifying knowing all things we are capable of.</span> <span data-start="166.04" data-end="169.75">For example, you can get lots of controls over your tabs.</span> <span data-start="169.75" data-end="176.01">It can open new ones, read the ones open currently, and close them.</span> <span data-start="176.01" data-end="178.04">Pop-up blocks for a good example of this.</span> <span data-start="178.04" data-end="182.91">They monitor open tabs and monitor those that detect problems.</span> <span data-start="182.91" data-end="188.45">And we can make network requests.</span> <span data-start="188.45" data-end="192.68">Mail checker will ping the server regularly to see if you have new mail and if it detects</span> <span data-start="192.68" data-end="195.78">new ones it shows you how many.</span> <span data-start="195.78" data-end="201.63">We can read, modify and add to the DOM of any web page and this could be used in a creative</span> <span data-start="201.63" data-end="202.65">way.</span> <span data-start="202.65" data-end="209.11">This is a video of Google's translate which reads the selected text from the DOM and adds</span> <span data-start="209.11" data-end="213.53">a tool set to the page to show you the translation.</span> <span data-start="213.53" data-end="222.53">Another example is my personal favorite called millennials to snake people and it is awesome.</span> <span data-start="222.53" data-end="226.88">What it does is finds any instance of the word millennials on the page and replaces</span> <span data-start="226.88" data-end="233.96">it with the word snake people to write results like this.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="233.96" data-end="239.23">Here the plugin is actively modifying text nodes put into the DOM by the house page and</span> <span data-start="239.23" data-end="242.67">that could be dangerous but we will get to that later.</span> <span data-start="242.67" data-end="248.52">To go back to the earlier question, if browser extensions can do all those amazing and powerful</span> <span data-start="248.52" data-end="251.36">things then what can't they do?</span> <span data-start="251.36" data-end="252.67">The list is pretty small.</span> <span data-start="252.67" data-end="258">First, they are tied to the browser so if the browser isn't open, the extension can't</span> <span data-start="258" data-end="259">run.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259" data-end="260.799">Pretty obvious but worth calling out.</span> <span data-start="260.799" data-end="264.69">Next, you can't go changing your permissions willy-nilly.</span> <span data-start="264.69" data-end="268.32">You have to declare which pages you want to run on and which parts of the web extension</span> <span data-start="268.32" data-end="275.15">API you want  to access.</span> <span data-start="275.15" data-end="280.15">If you want to go change those permissions later on, the extension is temporarily disabled</span> <span data-start="280.15" data-end="287.28">until the user agrees to the user's new one.</span> <span data-start="287.28" data-end="306.55">Probably the most important thing it can't do is directly interact with the</span> <span data-start="306.55" data-end="308.54">host page's JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="308.54" data-end="311.24">They don't even share the same Window object.</span> <span data-start="311.24" data-end="316.1">While this is sometimes a problem, for the most part, it is a good thing.</span> </p>
