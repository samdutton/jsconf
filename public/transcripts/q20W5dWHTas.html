<p><span data-start="1292.34" data-end="1298.509">The big question is of course, is it useful?</span> <span data-start="1298.509" data-end="1310.09">You look quite, sometimes, it is easy to speak to the phone.</span> <span data-start="1310.09" data-end="1313">Something you do with the phone.</span> <span data-start="1313" data-end="1319.409">You look silly when you try to command your phone.</span> <span data-start="1319.409" data-end="1320.899">Search.</span> <span data-start="1320.899" data-end="1322.399">People..</span> <span data-start="1322.399" data-end="1328.99">Also, you disturb other people if you are talking to your phone all the time and doing</span> <span data-start="1328.99" data-end="1330.45">stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1330.45" data-end="1338.72">And as we saw, it is very difficult to decode the speech, there are bound to be mistakes.</span> <span data-start="1338.72" data-end="1346.62">Bound to be mistakes when you speak to the phone.</span> <span data-start="1346.62" data-end="1352.01">Then, the gestures.</span> <span data-start="1352.01" data-end="1355.21">2D and 3D gestures.</span> <span data-start="1355.21" data-end="1358.269">They lack a common language.</span> <span data-start="1358.269" data-end="1365.6">We don't have a way of, common set of gestures that mean something.</span> <span data-start="1365.6" data-end="1367.8">That's a challenge.</span> <span data-start="1367.8" data-end="1375.11">Also, they are quite hard to do on screen as you saw.</span> <span data-start="1375.11" data-end="1378.75">If you have a scrolling search result and you have to draw a circle.</span> <span data-start="1378.75" data-end="1381.71">Or triangle or something.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1381.71" data-end="1385.97">It is not very easy to interact.</span> <span data-start="1385.97" data-end="1394.35">Also, 3D gestures are quite hard to code.</span> <span data-start="1394.35" data-end="1400.23">And to separate noise and different interactions from eachother.</span> <span data-start="1400.23" data-end="1415.919">So, there is a really a lot of challenges involved.</span> <span data-start="1415.919" data-end="1424.559">But I guess, as always, it is very important that you evaluate new features and test them</span> <span data-start="1424.559" data-end="1425.96">on users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1425.96" data-end="1435.32">In this case, I really couldn't see any of these ideas getting into the production search</span> <span data-start="1435.32" data-end="1438.2">engine.</span> <span data-start="1438.2" data-end="1442.72">Perhaps, perhaps this.</span> <span data-start="1442.72" data-end="1445.299">Except this.</span> <span data-start="1445.299" data-end="1450.33">Not scrolling down.</span> <span data-start="1450.33" data-end="1460.169">The subtle tilt, you can do it with the phone.</span> <span data-start="1460.169" data-end="1462.649">That's okay for me I think.</span> <span data-start="1462.649" data-end="1467.149">That could work.</span> <span data-start="1467.149" data-end="1468.659">But..</span> <span data-start="1468.659" data-end="1474.21">Drawing circles on the screen seems a bit off.</span> <span data-start="1474.21" data-end="1480.679">So, as always, when you do such things.</span> <span data-start="1480.679" data-end="1483.82">Kill your darlings.</span> <span data-start="1483.82" data-end="1491.23">This is the best advice I probably can give when dealing with these things.</span> <span data-start="1491.23" data-end="1494.269">Cutting edge speech and 3D gestures.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1494.269" data-end="1495.669">That was it.</span> <span data-start="1495.669" data-end="1496.669">Thank you.</span> </p>
