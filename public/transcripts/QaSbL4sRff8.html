data-end="534.98">it took me a while to figure out the</span> <span data-start="534.98" data-end="536.779">formulas and equations to get it to work</span> <span data-start="536.779" data-end="538.85">so I was really happy by the end of the</span> <span data-start="538.85" data-end="541.399">day that I was able to make it happen so</span> <span data-start="541.399" data-end="546.78">the next day I took a little breather</span> <span data-start="546.79" data-end="551.36">okay it's supposed to say hooray and</span> <span data-start="551.36" data-end="553.49">came back right back the next day with</span> <span data-start="553.49" data-end="554.99">bug blaster so this is a little cannon</span> <span data-start="554.99" data-end="556.16">game where we have these bugs up in the</span> <span data-start="556.16" data-end="557.93">sky and you're supposed to hit him with</span> <span data-start="557.93" data-end="559.58">this cannon and you can adjust the</span> <span data-start="559.58" data-end="562.25">parameters so this was also another</span> <span data-start="562.25" data-end="563.87">difficult physics problem for me to</span> <span data-start="563.87" data-end="566">tackle and it took a long time for me to</span> <span data-start="566" data-end="567.44">actually get the cannon to work</span> <span data-start="567.44" data-end="569.84">correctly so I didn't get to add as much</span> <span data-start="569.84" data-end="571.55">design as I wanted to but then a friend</span> <span data-start="571.55" data-end="573.2">mentioned that I've gone from basically</span> <span data-start="573.2" data-end="576.2">from 0 to 2d kinematics in two days so I</span> <span data-start="576.2" data-end="579.88">felt a little bit better about that and</span> <span data-start="579.88" data-end="582.8">this is blinky this is from day 123 and</span> <span data-start="582.8" data-end="585.05">this is based off of my favorite prices</span> <span data-start="585.05" data-end="587.75">right games link go and you can see you</span> <span data-start="587.75" data-end="589.19">drop a disc and it has to bounce off</span> <span data-start="589.19" data-end="591.2">these little pins and you're supposed to</span> <span data-start="591.2" data-end="593.99">get it into the green area and I had set</span> <span data-start="593.99" data-end="596.39">out on the day to make this unbelievably</span> <span data-start="596.39" data-end="598.85">awesome game and it was incredibly</span> <span data-start="598.85" data-end="600.5">difficult for me to actually get that</span> <span data-start="600.5" data-end="601.82">ball to bounce off of those pins</span> <span data-start="601.82" data-end="604.58">correctly so it ended up taking to the</span> <span data-start="604.58" data-end="605.9">wee hours of morning just to get it this</span> <span data-start="605.9" data-end="607.49">far so I was pretty bummed because I had</span> <span data-start="607.49" data-end="610.13">set out to do something a lot more with</span> <span data-start="610.13" data-end="612.08">this and didn't get as far as I wanted</span> <span data-start="612.08" data-end="615.47">to so I felt like kind of a failure but</span> <span data-start="615.47" data-end="617.87">in reality there were a number of</span> <span data-start="617.87" data-end="620.29">failure days throughout the project</span> <span data-start="620.29" data-end="622.73">so the first failure day comes from day</span> <span data-start="622.73"

happening</span> <span data-start="635.69" data-end="637.94">is I started the day and I made a mock</span> <span data-start="637.94" data-end="640.01">and it made another mock-up I made</span> <span
