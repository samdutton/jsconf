<p><span data-start="21.92" data-end="22.96">Hello Everyone</span> <span data-start="22.96" data-end="25.76">Today, I'm going to be talking about Electron</span> <span data-start="26" data-end="27.74">Not the technical part.</span> <span data-start="28.14" data-end="32.06">I will talk about how I built the community for electron</span> <span data-start="32.36" data-end="36.24">and how the community of Electron helped it grow</span> <span data-start="39.36" data-end="41.46">My name is Cheng</span> <span data-start="41.54" data-end="44.46">And I created the Electron framework</span> <span data-start="44.46" data-end="47.14">I'm currently working at Github</span> <span data-start="47.14" data-end="48.72">and still working on Electron</span> <span data-start="49.94" data-end="55">So if you have ever created an issue at Electron the repo</span> <span data-start="55.1" data-end="57.56">you might known me because</span> <span data-start="57.96" data-end="60.9">I'm usually the guy who closed your issues</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="64.26" data-end="66.74">So before talking about Electron</span> <span data-start="66.74" data-end="69.14">I need to talk about its history first</span> <span data-start="69.14" data-end="73.54">It's still a relatively little project</span> <span data-start="74" data-end="78.74">But the history originated from node-webkit</span> <span data-start="79.28" data-end="81.5">And if you know about nw.js</span> <span data-start="81.8" data-end="85.4">node-webkit is the older name of nw.js</span> <span data-start="87.28" data-end="92.9">So the first edition of node-webkit is the node.js module</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="95.36" data-end="99.92">It was not production-ready</span> <span data-start="106.62" data-end="108.96">And then a year later</span> <span data-start="108.96" data-end="111.56">I joined the development of node-webkit</span> <span data-start="113.2" data-end="116.5">From that time node-webkit became a framework</span> <span data-start="116.76" data-end="121.46">that you can develop desktop apps based on it</span> <span data-start="122.18" data-end="125.82">It was basically the nw.js you know now</span> <span data-start="127.2" data-end="131.62">And then a year later I started a new project</span> <span data-start="131.62" data-end="134.46">named atom-shell</span> <span data-start="134.76" data-end="137.08">And it was open-sourced and</span> <span data-start="137.34" data-end="138.92">then renamed to Electron</span> <span data-start="141.46" data-end="143.44">So the story of Electron</span> <span data-start="143.76" data-end="146.5">started from node-webkit</span> <span data-start="149.08" data-end="152.58">I joined the development of node-webkit</span> <span data-start="152.94" data-end="156.78">when I was doing an internship at Intel</span> <span data-start="156.78" data-end="159.5">At that time, node-webkit was</span> <span data-start="159.8" data-end="161.82">a perfect project for interns</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="162.7" data-end="164.08">Because it was interesting</span> <span data-start="164.62" data-end="166.08">It was open-source</span> <span data-start="167.42" data-end="168.86">And most importantly</span> <span data-start="169.56" data-end="171.76">no one was using node-webkit</span> <span data-start="172.62" data-end="174.14">So it doesn't matter if</span> <span data-start="174.52" data-end="176.54">an intern messed up with it</span> <span data-start="178.74" data-end="182.28">So I started as the only developer of node-webkit</span> <span data-start="183.48" data-end="187.56">And because there were no users,</span> <span data-start="187.98" data-end="191.36">I could just do whatever I want to the project</span> <span data-start="196.66" data-end="198.62">And most importantly</span> <span data-start="199.12" data-end="201.28">no one gave a shit about it so..</span> <span data-start="202.84" data-end="206.02">My manager didn't care</span> <span data-start="206.42" data-end="209.16">and, well, the company didn't care</span> <span data-start="209.48" data-end="212">It was just a project for interns</span> <span data-start="216.96" data-end="218.4">So for me, at that time</span> <span data-start="218.7" data-end="220.2">the most important thing was</span> <span data-start="220.98" data-end="223.32">to define what node-webkit should be</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="223.92" data-end="226.98">So at that time I decided that</span> <span data-start="227.82" data-end="230.28">I can probably rewrite webkit as</span> <span data-start="231.04" data-end="234.26">the platform to develop desktop apps</span> <span data-start="234.98" data-end="237.58">with html and node.js</span> <span data-start="238.28" data-end="240.68">There were already many projects</span> <span data-start="241.1" data-end="243.1">doing similar things, but..</span> <span data-start="243.98" data-end="246.54">apparently all of them were shit</span> <span data-start="247.52" data-end="251.14">So by working on node-webkit</span> <span data-start="252.1" data-end="256.38">I can probably create a new generation project</span> <span data-start="260.36" data-end="262.12">After spending a few months</span> <span data-start="262.54" data-end="264.18">developing node-webkit</span> <span data-start="265.38" data-end="267.36">Well, I finally got something</span> <span data-start="268.12" data-end="269.66">that really worked</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="271.54" data-end="273.6">My manager was happy with it</span> <span data-start="273.96" data-end="275.16">because I was</span> <span data-start="275.72" data-end="277.48">not wasting my time</span> <span data-start="278.16" data-end="280.14">doing unrelated things</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.94" data-end="282.22">It was a nice result</span> <span data-start="282.6" data-end="284.62">for interns</span> <span data-start="285.62" data-end="288.02">But a problem for me</span> <span data-start="289.88" data-end="291.84">was that it still had no users</span> <span data-start="293.34" data-end="295.52">I was just spending a few months</span> <span data-start="296.6" data-end="298.04">entertaining myself</span> <span data-start="298.14" data-end="299.82">entertaining my manager</span> <span data-start="301.24" data-end="303.08">It was not real open-source</span> <span data-start="304.98" data-end="306.1">So I decided to</span> <span data-start="307.46" data-end="309.7">build a community of node-webkit</span> <span data-start="311.04" data-end="313.06">and had everyone using it</span> <span data-start="315.96" data-end="317.48">So the first thing I did</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="320.14">was to build a small community</span> <span data-start="321.84" data-end="323.7">at that time it was</span> <span data-start="324.04" data-end="325.24">quite a simple one</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="326.48" data-end="328.5">I used GitHub issues for bug reports</span> <span data-start="329.34" data-end="332.06">questions and any type of thing</span> <span data-start="333.24" data-end="336.04">And there was a mailing list on Google Groups</span> <span data-start="337.82" data-end="339.4">There were people</span> <span data-start="339.68" data-end="341.04">who were preferring</span> <span data-start="341.48" data-end="343.46">the older type of discussion</span> <span data-start="348.22" data-end="350.38">So after building the community</span> <span data-start="351.14" data-end="353.38">I started to promote node-webkit</span> <span data-start="354.5" data-end="355.58">and that's the</span> <span data-start="357.1" data-end="358.78">most important thing for</span> <span data-start="359.12" data-end="360.38">new projects, you need to</span> <span data-start="360.84" data-end="362.84">make people know your project</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.74" data-end="366.58">So at that time node-webkit</span> <span data-start="367.62" data-end="369.36">didn't have a strong background</span> <span data-start="371.54" data-end="372.74">even though it was</span> <span data-start="373.94" data-end="375.86">a project sponsored by Intel</span> <span data-start="377.36" data-end="380.34">but there was a only an intern working on it</span> <span data-start="381.22" data-end="382.5">and the project was not</span> <span data-start="383.12" data-end="385.12">under Intel's GitHub account</span> <span data-start="386.34" data-end="389">It was actually under the account of</span> <span data-start="389.92" data-end="392.74">an Intel employee</span> <span data-start="393.2" data-end="395.84">who wrote the first edition of node-webkit</span> <span data-start="397.4" data-end="399.4">When people saw node-webkit</span> <span data-start="400.18" data-end="402.02">they were just seeing it's a</span> <span data-start="402.72" data-end="404.94">simple project developed by no none</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.02" data-end="411.98">So I needed to advertise it</span> <span data-start="412.36" data-end="413.56">The thing I did was</span> <span data-start="415.36" data-end="418.68">announcements at different mailing lists</span> <span data-start="419.44" data-end="420.78">saying that I</span> <span data-start="421.3" data-end="422.6">created a new awesome project</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.7" data-end="425.76">Just come and use it</span> <span data-start="427.9" data-end="430.38">some people might be interested in it</span> <span data-start="432.16" data-end="434.64">they might ask very stupid questions</span> <span data-start="436.94" data-end="438.14">Well, at that time</span> <span data-start="438.64" data-end="440.88">no matter how stupid the questions might be</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="441.7" data-end="444.42">I still needed to answer every one of them</span> <span data-start="445.64" data-end="448.12">so I probably might have my first user</span> <span data-start="450.82" data-end="452.74">And another important thing was</span> <span data-start="454.14" data-end="456.86">I needed to keep publishing a new release</span> <span data-start="458.82" data-end="462.1">So if I just do one release of the project</span> <span data-start="462.6" data-end="464.6">and then do nothing later</span> <span data-start="465.64" data-end="467.26">people would think</span> <span data-start="467.64" data-end="471.1">this was just a hobby project</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472" data-end="475.18">If use it I will be fucked up in the end</span> <span data-start="476" data-end="478.28">So the most important thing is to</span> <span data-start="478.5" data-end="480">keep releasing</span> <span data-start="480.28" data-end="483.6">new versions of the project</span> <span data-start="486.38" data-end="488.38">After I kept doing so</span> <span data-start="489.12" data-end="491.54">I finally got my first user</span> <span data-start="493.12" data-end="495.44">That one was actually quite famous</span> <span data-start="496.52" data-end="498.2">If you knew</span> <span data-start="498.98" data-end="502.26">Light Table was an editor</span> <span data-start="502.58" data-end="504.58">based on real web technology</span> <span data-start="508.44" data-end="513.54">It was like the fist program project on Kick Starter</span> <span data-start="515.24" data-end="517.74">So it gained a lot of</span> <span data-start="518.08" data-end="520.08">It was a very famous project and</span> <span data-start="520.64" data-end="524.38">it helped node-webkit get lots of attention</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="530.06" data-end="533.5">So once we had a first user</span> <span data-start="534.06" data-end="535.98">we might have a second and then more</span> <span data-start="537.1" data-end="540.12">After that the most important thing became</span> <span data-start="540.8" data-end="543.66">we needed to keep our first user</span> <span data-start="547.44" data-end="549.66">How do you keep them?</span> <span data-start="550.42" data-end="552.34">There's only one thing to do</span> <span data-start="552.34" data-end="554.38">is just answer their questions</span> <span data-start="555.4" data-end="558.54">and implement the features they want</span> <span data-start="558.54" data-end="560.46">and fix the bugs they are troubled with</span> <span data-start="562.7" data-end="565.04">They are getting support from you and</span> <span data-start="565.44" data-end="568.28">they will be confident in your project</span> <span data-start="572.68" data-end="574.92">So more and more people were</span> <span data-start="575.34" data-end="577.98">using node-webkit and I was</span> <span data-start="578.4" data-end="580.56">doing a good job of keeping them</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="581.58" data-end="583.72">Somehow, it started to become famous</span> <span data-start="587.98" data-end="590.98">So usually when your project becomes famous</span> <span data-start="592.2" data-end="594.78">you actually have lots of choices</span> <span data-start="596.64" data-end="598.48">You can ask for sponsorship</span> <span data-start="599" data-end="600.52">from the big companies</span> <span data-start="600.82" data-end="602.38">who use your project</span> <span data-start="602.74" data-end="604.2">so you can get money</span> <span data-start="604.5" data-end="606.5">by working on your own project</span> <span data-start="606.98" data-end="610.34">Or you can ask some of the contributors</span> <span data-start="610.9" data-end="613.42">of the project to get into your team</span> <span data-start="614.18" data-end="616.54">so you have more people working on the project</span> <span data-start="617.56" data-end="621.02">or you can even start a company or career</span> <span data-start="621.64" data-end="624.8">based on your own project</span> <span data-start="625.1" data-end="626.68">probably you can make</span> <span data-start="626.88" data-end="628.32">huge money from it</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="630.52" data-end="633.04">One of them was just to</span> <span data-start="633.34" data-end="636.3">keep your project growing bigger and bigger</span> <span data-start="639.66" data-end="643.34">As for me, it was a bit different</span> <span data-start="645.52" data-end="647.96">Ater node-webkit became famous</span> <span data-start="649.38" data-end="651.58">I did not work on it anymore</span> <span data-start="653.1" data-end="655.1">Because if you still remember</span> <span data-start="655.56" data-end="657.4">I did not own node-webkit</span> </p>
