data-start="22.349" data-end="23.849">programming language I've been making</span> <span data-start="23.849" data-end="27.84">for young children so I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="27.84" data-end="29.39">about designing a language for children</span> <span data-start="29.39" data-end="32.07">I'm going to talk about the compiler</span> <span data-start="32.07" data-end="35.37">that I wrote that runs the language I'm</span> <span data-start="35.37" data-end="36.449">going to talk about teaching my</span> <span data-start="36.449" data-end="40.199">girlfriend and my dad to program and I'm</span> <span data-start="40.199" data-end="43.489">gonna speak about modes of expression</span> <span data-start="43.489" data-end="46.14">but first I'll take you through your</span> <span data-start="46.14" data-end="50.37">first program written in ila code so</span> <span data-start="50.37" data-end="55.409">either as a drummer his years hopefully</span> <span data-start="55.409" data-end="61.229">yep that's my niece she's called ila she</span> <span data-start="61.229" data-end="66.5">likes the Yankees she's 2 years old and</span> <span data-start="66.5" data-end="69.479">her favorite lunch is jelly tots which</span> <span data-start="69.479" data-end="73.17">is a type of English sweetie here's some</span> <span data-start="73.17" data-end="75.96">more people mary is a guitarist and Emma</span> <span data-start="75.96" data-end="79.579">is a singer and Sophie is a pianist and</span> <span data-start="79.579" data-end="84.149">he's a list of eyelas auntie's so we'll</span> <span data-start="84.149" data-end="89.189">had Mary to that list Emma and Sophie so</span> <span data-start="89.189" data-end="92.369">let's review islets a drummer she's 2</span> <span data-start="92.369" data-end="92.999">years old</span> <span data-start="92.999" data-end="95.13">she loves jelly tots and she's got three</span> <span data-start="95.13" data-end="97.59">aunties a

all</span> <span data-start="105.929" data-end="109.95">can children program I feel like a age 5</span> <span data-start="109.95" data-end="112.71">which is the lower bound of the age</span> <span data-start="112.71" data-end="114.84">range I'm aiming at for this language</span> <span data-start="114.84" data-end="118.109">then at age 5 then children can learning</span> <span data-start="118.109" data-end="119.88">to read learning to write which mean to</span> <span data-start="119.88" data-end="121.979">me means they can input code at the</span> <span data-start="121.979" data-end="125.009">keyboard and read it off the screen and</span> <span data-start="125.009" data-end="127.35">they can also reason as well they've got</span> <span data-start="127.35" data-end="129.27">the Faculty of reasoning so I've had</span> <span data-start="129.27" data-end="131.58">some humiliating defeats at the hands of</span> <span data-start="131.58" data-end="134.16">my niece when debating whether she</span> <span data-start="134.16" data-end="135.27">should be allowed to have another jelly</span> <span data-start="135.27" data-end="139.11">tot or so and then should children</span> <span data-start="139.11" data-end="143.94">program well computers are being used to</span> <span data-start="143.94" data-end="146.13">make more and more stuff and that's only</span> <span data-start="146.13" data-end="147.75">going to increase as time goes on and</span> <span data-start="147.75" data-end="149.29">also I think program</span> <span data-start="149.29" data-end="151.89">is the best way to control the computer</span> <span data-start="151.89" data-end="156.519">and so and I think a person makes</span> <span data-start="156.519" data-end="158.349">something to try and show what is inside</span> <span data-start="158.349" data-end="160.42">their head and I think it's a really</span> <span data-start="160.42" data-end="161.799">good thing for people to show each other</span> <span data-start="161.799" data-end="165.4">the insides of their heads and so should</span> <span data-start="165.4" data-end="167.079">children program well if computers are</span> <span data-start="167.079" data-end="168.37">being used to make more and more stuff</span> <span data-start="168.37" data-end="170.319">and programming is the best way to</span> <span data-start="170.319" data-end="172.54">control a computer then to me</span> <span data-start="172.54" data-end="174.099">programming is becoming like a core</span> <span data-start="174.099" data-end="176.2">skill the way we view reading and</span> <span data-start="176.2" data-end="178.09">writing and doing maths at the moment</span> <span data-start="178.09" data-end="180.939">and so I think programming should be</span> <span data-start="180.939" data-end="182.29">learned at the same time as all those</span> <span data-start="182.29" data-end="184.03">skills are you from about age four or</span> <span data-start="184.03" data-end="189.879">five what are the opinions that I use to</span> <span data-start="189.879" data-end="192.419">guide the development of the language</span> <span data-start="192.419" data-end="196.139">well number one programming is typing so</span> <span data-start="196.139" data-end="198.28">programming is not clipping together</span> <span data-start="198.28" data-end="199.9">little jigsaw pieces that have code</span> <span data-start="199.9" data-end="203.169">written on them it's not manipulating</span> <span data-start="203.169" data-end="205.419">blocks with a GUI it's not using any</span> <span data-start="205.419" data-end="207.78">kind of GUI it's it's it's typing words</span> <span data-start="207.78" data-end="211.15">into a computer and the reason this is</span> <span data-start="211.15" data-end="214.479">important is number one language is the</span> <span data-start="214.479" data-end="216.25">best way that humans have come up with</span> <span data-start="216.25" data-end="219.639">for expressing ideas in a powerful and</span> <span data-start="219.639" data-end="223.569">subtle way and number two there's this</span> <span data-start="223.569" data-end="225.34">notion of indirection which is the</span> <span data-start="225.34" data-end="227.019">reason that I think programming so fun</span> <span data-start="227.019" data-end="229.209">so I type in something into the computer</span> <span data-start="229.209" data-end="231.97">here and then something happens over</span> <span data-start="231.97" data-end="234.28">here and in between there's magic and</span> <span data-start="234.28" data-end="237.76">that magic is fun but I'll come back to</span> <span data-start="237.76" data-end="240.97">that idea in a bit number two the second</span> <span data-start="240.97" data-end="242.949">opinion I took was that you should have</span> <span data-start="242.949" data-end="244.269">an application for a programming</span> <span data-start="244.269" data-end="245.859">language it should be useful for</span> <span data-start="245.859" data-end="249.579">something so I didn't want kids just or</span> <span data-start="249.579" data-end="252.129">anyone just typing in random code to</span> <span data-start="252.129" data-end="254.139">instantiate variables or print out the</span> <span data-start="254.139" data-end="255.489">numbers between one and a hundred</span> <span data-start="255.489" data-end="258.039">because that's really dull they should</span> <span data-start="258.039" data-end="259.209">be able to make something with it</span> <span data-start="259.209" data-end="260.199">because that's the whole point of</span> <span data-start="260.199" data-end="262.3">programming to me is to express yourself</span> <span data-start="262.3" data-end="264.639">to actually make something and so the</span> <span data-start="264.639" data-end="266.44">application that I chose to start with</span> <span data-start="266.44" data-end="270.13">was a old school text adventure writing</span> <span data-start="270.13" data-end="272.56">environment so you can type Eila code</span> <span data-start="272.56" data-end="275.77">and you define your own old school text</span> <span data-start="275.77" data-end="277.779">adventure you know kind of like Zork or</span> <span data-start="277.779" data-end="279.43">adventure or whatever and then you can</span> <span data-start="279.43" data-end="282.06">play through it so it's interactive</span> <span data-start="282.06" data-end="284.37">but at the same time different heads</span> <span data-start="284.37" data-end="286.8">contain different things so I didn't</span> <span data-start="286.8" data-end="289.77">want to tie the core language to the</span> <span data-start="289.77" data-end="291.51">particular application that I chose the</span> <span data-start="291.51" data-end="293.25">storytelling environment and so I've</span> <span data-start="293.25" data-end="294.93">tried to make it general so that it</span> <span data-start="294.93" data-end="297.32">could be conceivably used for anything</span> <span data-start="297.32" data-end="301.73">and number four the fourth principle</span> <span data-start="301.73" data-end="304.169">that I've used to guide the development</span> <span data-start="304.169" data-end="306.87">is to use baby talk so what I mean by</span> <span data-start="306.87" data-end="308.6">that is to try and make the language</span> <span data-start="308.6" data-end="312.11">similar to how children actually speak</span> <span data-start="312.11" data-end="314.82">so that that means there's a few</span> <span data-start="314.82" data-end="316.8">ramifications of that so number one</span> <span data-start="316.8" data-end="318.72">there's no punctuation except for the</span> <span data-start="318.72" data-end="321.36">apostrophes that go around strings and</span> <span data-start="321.36" data-end="324.62">that's because punctuation is hard to</span> <span data-start="324.62" data-end="326.79">distinguish it's hard to distinguish</span> <span data-start="326.79" data-end="328.38">pieces of punctuation from each other</span> <span data-start="328.38" data-end="330.57">and it's also hard to type punctuation</span> <span data-start="330.57" data-end="331.68">because you often need to use the shift</span> <span data-start="331.68" data-end="339.21">key number two is that most programming</span> <span data-start="339.21" data-end="341.729">languages use programming jargon like</span> <span data-start="341.729" data-end="345.93">for or if a while or then and I mean</span> <span data-start="345.93" data-end="348.12">what the hell do they mean so all of the</span> <span data-start="348.12" data-end="350.4">keywords in either of words that a child</span> <span data-start="350.4" data-end="352.62">would actually use in the context that</span> <span data-start="352.62" data-end="357.66">they're used and the number three is the</span> <span data-start="357.66" data-end="359.789">language is somewhat natural language</span> <span data-start="359.789" data-end="362.94">ish and my aim there is to try and make</span> <span data-start="362.94" data-end="364.38">it so that even if you don't know much</span> <span data-start="364.38" data-end="366.539">code even if you don't know how to code</span> <span data-start="366.539" data-end="368.789">you'll be able to read the language and</span> <span data-start="368.789" data-end="370.289">basically read a piece of code and</span> <span data-start="370.289" data-end="373.2">basically understand what's going on but</span> <span data-start="373.2" data-end="374.55">at the same time I'm trying to avoid</span> <span data-start="374.55" data-end="376.47">that trap that say Apple script falls</span> <span data-start="376.47" data-end="379.26">into where it looks like English and it</span> <span data-start="379.26" data-end="380.37">gives you the impression that you can</span> <span data-start="380.37" data-end="382.169">just type any random thing that comes</span> <span data-start="382.169" data-end="384.03">into your head that's in English you</span> <span data-start="384.03" data-end="385.02">know the computer will magically</span> <span data-start="385.02" data-end="386.7">understand because of course it won't</span> <span data-start="386.7" data-end="389.22">and so there's only one way to do</span> <span data-start="389.22" data-end="391.44">everything and it's very consistent and</span> <span data-start="391.44" data-end="393.87">it's a much closer to a sort of pidgin</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.87" data-end="395.639">English so I'm trying to avoid that</span> <span data-start="395.639" data-end="396.87">impression that you can just type any</span> <span data-start="396.87" data-end="400.9">random stuff that comes into your head</span> <span data-start="400.91" data-end="404.13">so the ILA compiler this is the thing</span> <span data-start="404.13" data-end="406.86">that the piece of code that goes from a</span> <span data-start="406.86" data-end="408.99">piece of violet code like this so right</span> <span data-start="408.99" data-end="412.65">Eila to actually printing out either at</span> <span data-start="412.65" data-end="415.2">the console so how do we get from</span> <span data-start="415.2" data-end="420.21">a piece of code — the result well the</span> <span data-start="420.21" data-end="422.13">compiler that I wrote takes a two-stage</span> <span data-start="422.13" data-end="425.46">process does a two-stage process number</span> <span data-start="425.46" data-end="428.67">one parsing number two interpreting so</span> <span data-start="428.67" data-end="431.16">let's start with parsing parsing is</span> <span data-start="431.16" data-end="432.81">taking that piece of code which starts</span> <span data-start="432.81" data-end="434.58">out as a completely unstructured string</span> <span data-start="434.58" data-end="438">so just a list of characters and turning</span> <span data-start="438" data-end="439.71">it into a much more detailed recipe</span> <span data-start="439.71" data-end="442.41">called an abstract syntax tree which can</span> <span data-start="442.41" data-end="446.4">be used to actually run the code so here</span> <span data-start="446.4" data-end="448.41">is the abstract syntax tree for that</span> <span data-start="448.41" data-end="449.85">piece of code that we just saw a moment</span> <span data-start="449.85" data-end="450.72">ago right</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="450.72" data-end="452.37">Eila so this is going to print out</span> <span data-start="452.37" data-end="454.59">islets of the console nothing else so</span> <span data-start="454.59" data-end="456.69">let's go through it so at the top level</span> <span data-start="456.69" data-end="458.49">the whole thing is a tree then you have</span> <span data-start="458.49" data-end="460.08">an expression so the whole piece of code</span> <span data-start="460.08" data-end="462">is an expression and then you can</span> <span data-start="462" data-end="464.49">subcategorize that expression as an</span> <span data-start="464.49" data-end="466.71">invocation which means you're running a</span> <span data-start="466.71" data-end="469.53">function and then that invocation splits</span> <span data-start="469.53" data-end="472.02">down into two components the identifier</span> <span data-start="472.02" data-end="473.25">which is the name of the function you</span> <span data-start="473.25" data-end="477.15">want to work to run right WRI T and then</span> <span data-start="477.15" data-end="480.06">the parameter or the value which is the</span> <span data-start="480.06" data-end="481.5">parameter being passed to the function</span> <span data-start="481.5" data-end="483.87">which is either in quotation marks and</span> <span data-start="483.87" data-end="486.57">then the value can be sub categorized as</span> <span data-start="486.57" data-end="488.94">a literal as opposed to a variable and</span> <span data-start="488.94" data-end="491.37">then the literal can be sub categorized</span> <span data-start="491.37" data-end="495.09">as a string as opposed to a number so</span> <span data-start="495.09" data-end="497.97">this is the end result of parsing so how</span> <span data-start="497.97" data-end="501.15">do we get there we I used something</span> <span data-start="501.15" data-end="503.07">called a parsing expression grammar or</span> <span data-start="503.07" data-end="507">also known as a peg for short and a</span> <span data-start="507" data-end="509.67">party expression grammar it's a list of</span> <span data-start="509.67" data-end="512.43">rules which basically says on one side</span> </p>

<span data-start="710.339" data-end="712.199">quick aside the way the interpret</span> <span data-start="712.199" data-end="714.959">function works is that essentially what</span> <span data-start="714.959" data-end="716.04">you want to do is you want to run</span> <span data-start="716.04" data-end="718.379">different code depending on what type of</span> <span data-start="718.379"

so if you're dealing with a string</span> <span data-start="726.869" data-end="729.089">node in the abstract syntax tree now you</span> <span data-start="729.089" data-end="733.499">could do this by

on</span> <span data-start="738.3" data-end="740.61">each class and that would totally work</span> <span data-start="740.61" data-end="742.41">so you'd have a class for an expression</span> <span

data-end="760.8">again we're in JavaScript here I used a</span> <span data-start="760.8" data-end="762.839">library called multi message s it's</span> <span data-start="762.839"

that are passed into the function so</span> <span data-start="781.589" data-end="783.72">let's look at an example so this is the</span> <span data-start="783.72" data-end="785.879">piece of code that decides which version</span> <span data-start="785.879" data-end="787.649">of the multi method to run so remember</span> <span data-start="787.649" data-end="789.72">we've got a version for an

<span data-start="793.17" data-end="795.12">which type of node we're dealing with so</span> <span data-start="795.12" data-end="796.259">we just look at the node that gets</span> <span
