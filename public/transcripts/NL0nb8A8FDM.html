<p><span data-start="80.009" data-end="83.22">I'm sure a few of us here are familiar</span> <span data-start="83.22" data-end="87.09">with the concept so this is Ableton Live</span> <span data-start="87.09" data-end="89.1">this is the software that I've used for</span> <span data-start="89.1" data-end="93.99">quite a long time now and it's um it's a</span> <span data-start="93.99" data-end="95.97">way of making music where you you're</span> <span data-start="95.97" data-end="98.009">basically putting all of the individual</span> <span data-start="98.009" data-end="101.13">notes in by hand while with the mouse so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="101.13" data-end="105.81">I have about five six different</span> <span data-start="105.81" data-end="108.45">instruments here and so the first one</span> <span data-start="108.45" data-end="114.64">we've got is a synthesized bell sound</span> <span data-start="114.65" data-end="116.79">so all those sounds are hearing I've</span> <span data-start="116.79" data-end="118.17">actually gone in here and I have</span> <span data-start="118.17" data-end="120.45">manually put them in with a mouse</span> <span data-start="120.45" data-end="122.7">actually I may have recorded this using</span> <span data-start="122.7" data-end="124.83">a MIDI keyboard but I'll get to it later</span> <span data-start="124.83" data-end="128.49">and but but the the point is that I have</span> <span data-start="128.49" data-end="130.47">complete control over everything that is</span> <span data-start="130.47" data-end="132.24">happening here I I see the entire</span> <span data-start="132.24" data-end="134.28">timeline out in front of me very much</span> <span data-start="134.28" data-end="137.64">like a composer would I'm not actually</span> <span data-start="137.64" data-end="141.99">playing an instrument Here I am telling</span> <span data-start="141.99" data-end="143.58">the computer where I want to hear sounds</span> <span data-start="143.58" data-end="145.23">so I'm gonna play you a little bit of</span> <span data-start="145.23" data-end="147.84">this song just so you can hear how it</span> <span data-start="147.84" data-end="173.959">all comes together so you see is a</span> <span data-start="173.959" data-end="177.209">marker moving left to right showing the</span> <span data-start="177.209" data-end="178.89">position and you can see the events</span> <span data-start="178.89" data-end="204.78">being played as it Scrolls past</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="204.79" data-end="210.2">Thanks so with this way of making music</span> <span data-start="210.2" data-end="213.14">it's more like you're painting your song</span> <span data-start="213.14" data-end="217.52">rather than playing your song</span> <span data-start="217.52" data-end="219.92">you're in complete control of every</span> <span data-start="219.92" data-end="223.22">single thing that happens and it's</span> <span data-start="223.22" data-end="224.599">actually quite a fun way to make music</span> <span data-start="224.599" data-end="225.86">particularly at first because you don't</span> <span data-start="225.86" data-end="227.959">actually have to be particularly skilled</span> <span data-start="227.959" data-end="230.72">at anything you can just put things in</span> <span data-start="230.72" data-end="234.709">and they make cool sounds and that's</span> <span data-start="234.709" data-end="237.2">what I was doing back in 2006 I was just</span> <span data-start="237.2" data-end="239.51">having fun making interesting</span> <span data-start="239.51" data-end="242.269">compositions on my computer I had a few</span> <span data-start="242.269" data-end="243.83">friends that were interested in too and</span> <span data-start="243.83" data-end="245.48">we were just just basically hanging out</span> <span data-start="245.48" data-end="247.25">at school not doing any work and just</span> <span data-start="247.25" data-end="252.2">making music and then I grabbed a bunch</span> <span data-start="252.2" data-end="254.15">of all the songs that I've made and I</span> <span data-start="254.15" data-end="258.979">uploaded them to the Internet and I made</span> <span data-start="258.979" data-end="262.88">some fancy cover art and I don't know</span> <span data-start="262.88" data-end="264.95">why but some music blog thought it was</span> <span data-start="264.95" data-end="267.71">really good and they wrote this</span> <span data-start="267.71" data-end="269.45">wonderful review all about my album and</span> <span data-start="269.45" data-end="271.789">then it got on some links sharing</span> <span data-start="271.789" data-end="273.56">services and before I knew what I was</span> <span data-start="273.56" data-end="275.27">getting hundreds of visitors every day</span> <span data-start="275.27" data-end="277.13">and all these people were downloading my</span> <span data-start="277.13" data-end="279.65">album and the next thing that happened</span> <span data-start="279.65" data-end="280.82">was I started receiving some fan mail</span> <span data-start="280.82" data-end="286.61">and I started off you know like oh this</span> <span data-start="286.61" data-end="288.5">is great we love your music and the next</span> <span data-start="288.5" data-end="291.38">minute was like come play your music at</span> <span data-start="291.38" data-end="294.979">our University and how on earth do you</span> <span data-start="294.979" data-end="299.27">play this this is not I didn't actually</span> <span data-start="299.27" data-end="302.6">perform it it's it was something that I</span> <span data-start="302.6" data-end="305.06">it's like asking asking a painter to</span> <span data-start="305.06" data-end="308.69">play their work live you can't really do</span> <span data-start="308.69" data-end="310.7">that but you can get them to exhibit</span> <span data-start="310.7" data-end="317.76">their work so a reproduction of the work</span> <span data-start="317.77" data-end="320.419">so yeah how do you play me as a computer</span> <span data-start="320.419" data-end="323.15">music laughs and the obvious way is just</span> <span data-start="323.15" data-end="324.59">to recruit recruit a bunch of musicians</span> <span data-start="324.59" data-end="326.96">to actually play all the individual</span> <span data-start="326.96" data-end="328.19">parts live for you</span> <span data-start="328.19" data-end="330.23">so maybe you can play the cool synth</span> <span data-start="330.23" data-end="332.36">flying or whatever but you have someone</span> <span data-start="332.36" data-end="334.63">else playing the drums and someone else</span> <span data-start="334.63" data-end="337.9">playing you know the other things and</span> <span data-start="337.9" data-end="340.58">there is actually a pretty cool way of</span> <span data-start="340.58" data-end="342.92">playing electronic music live I really</span> <span data-start="342.92" data-end="345.98">enjoy bands that do that but at the same</span> <span data-start="345.98" data-end="348.44">time it's it's a lot of work and it's</span> <span data-start="348.44" data-end="350">not the same thing you're actually</span> <span data-start="350" data-end="352.07">having to go back to the beginning and</span> <span data-start="352.07" data-end="353.48">refigure out how you gonna play your</span> <span data-start="353.48" data-end="358.91">song live so I I have never done this</span> <span data-start="358.91" data-end="360.56">and I would love to do this play yeah</span> <span data-start="360.56" data-end="362.03">this is this what obviously wasn't the</span> <span data-start="362.03" data-end="363.59">way forward you need you to pay them</span> <span data-start="363.59" data-end="364.76">obviously you need to pay the musicians</span> <span data-start="364.76" data-end="367.4">and yeah I'm I just want to work on my</span> <span data-start="367.4" data-end="369.56">own so really the only other option I</span> <span data-start="369.56" data-end="374.87">have is to DJ my music and this is</span> <span data-start="374.87" data-end="376.82">actually the way the majority of</span> <span data-start="376.82" data-end="378.71">electronic musicians or computer</span> <span data-start="378.71" data-end="381.77">musicians play their music live they are</span> <span data-start="381.77" data-end="384.95">really just playing you what they</span> <span data-start="384.95" data-end="388.76">created in their studio it may be as</span> <span data-start="388.76" data-end="391.34">simple as changing the tempo a little</span> <span data-start="391.34" data-end="393.47">bit and mixing the songs together or it</span> <span data-start="393.47" data-end="395.63">could get elaborate and you could split</span> <span data-start="395.63" data-end="397.43">all the individual parts of your song up</span> <span data-start="397.43" data-end="401.6">you take like that sound there that loop</span> <span data-start="401.6" data-end="409.84">and the drums and then put them all on a</span> <span data-start="409.84" data-end="417.8">special launcher</span> <span data-start="417.81" data-end="420.58">like this where I have all of the</span> <span data-start="420.58" data-end="422.38">individual parts of the song laid out in</span> <span data-start="422.38" data-end="445.42">front of me synth up here drums and we</span> <span data-start="445.42" data-end="453.07">have Hardware controllers so this device</span> <span data-start="453.07" data-end="456.16">here is called a launchpad it was</span> <span data-start="456.16" data-end="458.53">designed for being used with this</span> <span data-start="458.53" data-end="460.36">software here called Ableton Live and</span> <span data-start="460.36" data-end="463">you can see that this grid of all my</span> <span data-start="463" data-end="466.39">clips actually corresponds to this grid</span> <span data-start="466.39" data-end="470.59">so when I push that there that clip</span> <span data-start="470.59" data-end="473.62">launches I push this button here their</span> <span data-start="473.62" data-end="478.64">whole line watches</span> <span data-start="478.65" data-end="482.73">and I also have some knobs up here which</span> <span data-start="482.73" data-end="485.61">control a few parameters like the filter</span> <span data-start="485.61" data-end="516.13">so</span> <span data-start="516.14" data-end="522.99">so yeah that that works alright but if I</span> <span data-start="522.99" data-end="525.42">wanted to veer off the path at all if I</span> <span data-start="525.42" data-end="527.19">wanted to just play the synth a little</span> <span data-start="527.19" data-end="530.25">bit different I'm kind of stuck with I'm</span> <span data-start="530.25" data-end="534.48">just stuck with this pattern here I'm</span> <span data-start="534.48" data-end="535.83">not exactly going to come over to my</span> <span data-start="535.83" data-end="537.9">computer one plane and start plucking an</span> <span data-start="537.9" data-end="541.98">extra notes because that's that's stupid</span> <span data-start="541.98" data-end="547.68">and not cool and I want to be cool we</span> <span data-start="547.68" data-end="551.55">can add another controller and that will</span> <span data-start="551.55" data-end="554">let me play one of the instruments live</span> <span data-start="554" data-end="556.8">so I'm still using this for all my drums</span> <span data-start="556.8" data-end="562.38">etc etc but one of the synthesizers I</span> <span data-start="562.38" data-end="565.35">could play live on top so to do that I</span> <span data-start="565.35" data-end="570.54">would just select it from my list and</span> <span data-start="570.54" data-end="573.51">turn the input on and now when I play it</span> <span data-start="573.51" data-end="588.47">here</span> <span data-start="588.48" data-end="591.4">and here lies the problem I can't even</span> <span data-start="591.4" data-end="595.14">play the keyboard so Who am I kidding</span> <span data-start="595.14" data-end="603.37">yeah so all this this this is quite a</span> <span data-start="603.37" data-end="605.29">kind of quite a reasonable way of</span> <span data-start="605.29" data-end="610.24">playing your compositions alive but I</span> <span data-start="610.24" data-end="613.03">actually don't really find that that fun</span> <span data-start="613.03" data-end="614.47">and I tried doing this for a little</span> <span data-start="614.47" data-end="616.81">while and it was just it was just so</span> <span data-start="616.81" data-end="618.58">much work setting up everything and</span> <span data-start="618.58" data-end="619.75">putting in the perfect place and then</span> <span data-start="619.75" data-end="621.22">when you actually went to play it you</span> <span data-start="621.22" data-end="624.46">had no control you know I wanted to feel</span> <span data-start="624.46" data-end="626.14">like he could tourists they can just get</span> <span data-start="626.14" data-end="627.61">up on stage they can just start playing</span> <span data-start="627.61" data-end="629.5">their instrument and they can improvise</span> <span data-start="629.5" data-end="630.55">they can do it or they like they can</span> <span data-start="630.55" data-end="631.69">have other people playing along with</span> <span data-start="631.69" data-end="633.4">them and like a jazz band they just</span> <span data-start="633.4" data-end="636.58">groove and it's great I want to be able</span> <span data-start="636.58" data-end="638.98">to do that with electronic computer</span> <span data-start="638.98" data-end="645.64">music and well yeah obviously JavaScript</span> <span data-start="645.64" data-end="646.99">you kind of saw that one coming right</span> <span data-start="646.99" data-end="650.29">because it's J's cough bs JavaScript</span> <span data-start="650.29" data-end="651.7">that was where I went next</span> <span data-start="651.7" data-end="654.73">and the reason I went to JavaScript was</span> <span data-start="654.73" data-end="657.1">because I know JavaScript I don't know</span> <span data-start="657.1" data-end="663.19">any other languages and yeah I thought</span> <span data-start="663.19" data-end="666.16">let's just let's just see if we can if</span> <span data-start="666.16" data-end="669.46">we can add another layer of expression</span> <span data-start="669.46" data-end="676.45">to this software here so instead of me</span> <span data-start="676.45" data-end="679.69">having to play everything live</span> <span data-start="679.69" data-end="682.93">or having to rely on the clips that I've</span> <span data-start="682.93" data-end="684.85">already set up I want something in</span> <span data-start="684.85" data-end="691.96">between where I can play something and</span> <span data-start="691.96" data-end="693.94">head a button and that will keep looping</span> <span data-start="693.94" data-end="698.77">or I can go into a mode where everything</span> <span data-start="698.77" data-end="700.96">is triggered perfectly on beat because</span> <span data-start="700.96" data-end="705.97">that is kind of the most important sound</span> <span data-start="705.97" data-end="708.16">of computer music so everything is</span> <span data-start="708.16" data-end="709.99">perfectly quantized with the tempo and</span> <span data-start="709.99" data-end="712.78">if you want to make computer music it</span> <span data-start="712.78" data-end="715.78">has to be spot-on it has to be perfectly</span> <span data-start="715.78" data-end="718.99">in time and playing this isn't going to</span> <span data-start="718.99" data-end="727.76">get me that so what I want to do here is</span> <span data-start="727.77" data-end="730.39">intercept the messages from my MIDI</span> <span data-start="730.39"
