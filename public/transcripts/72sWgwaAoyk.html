data-end="283.729">grade you learned about addition is a</span> <span data-start="283.729" data-end="284.87">procedure</span> <span data-start="284.87" data-end="287.24">it's a very specific set of

data-end="303.14">sudden addition is in a procedure</span> <span data-start="303.14" data-end="305.12">anymore it's a relationship between</span> <span data-start="305.12" data-end="307.04">three

we</span> <span data-start="311.9" data-end="313.67">can calculate see it means some other</span> <span data-start="313.67" data-end="316.64">cool things too like given a and C we</span> <span

know we have</span> <span data-start="663.75" data-end="665.25">seven tax rates and these are</span> <span data-start="665.25" data-end="667.92">percentages and and for each of those</span> <span data-start="667.92" data-end="669.57">tax brackets there's a certain number of</span> <span data-start="669.57" data-end="671.82">dollars actually you know the total</span> <span data-start="671.82"

data-end="676.77">obviously aren't right the numbers are</span> <span data-start="676.77" data-end="679.74">big and ugly so I changed them but let's</span> <span data-start="679.74" data-end="682.41">make some constraints that describe a</span> <span data-start="682.41" data-end="684.12">solution to the problem of how to set</span> <span data-start="684.12" data-end="686.13">taxes for the US tax system</span> <span data-start="686.13" data-end="688.35">first we'll say that the very bottom tax</span> <span data-start="688.35" data-end="689.88">rate has to be greater than or equal to</span> <span data-start="689.88" data-end="693.18">zero can't have negative taxes of course</span> <span data-start="693.18" data-end="694.89">you can have negative Texas but makes</span> <span data-start="694.89" data-end="697.59">the problem nicer to not the very top</span> <span data-start="697.59" data-end="699.42">tax rate we'll say has to be less than a</span> <span data-start="699.42" data-end="701.07">hundred percent again you could have</span> <span data-start="701.07" data-end="704.25">taxed more than hundred percent but not</span> <span data-start="704.25" data-end="707.67">clear exactly what that means so now now</span> <span data-start="707.67" data-end="709.2">what we'll do is for each of the tax</span> <span data-start="709.2" data-end="711.78">rates we're going to describe the value</span> <span data-start="711.78" data-end="713.31">that each tax rate can have and I've</span> <span data-start="713.31" data-end="715.26">adopted here some syntax that isn't real</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="715.26" data-end="718.05">JavaScript syntax is like CoffeeScript</span> <span data-start="718.05" data-end="720.66">and Ruby syntax I'm sorry but it looks a</span> <span data-start="720.66" data-end="723.3">lot nicer so for each of the tax rates</span> <span data-start="723.3" data-end="725.97">will say you know the third tax rate</span> <span data-start="725.97" data-end="730.29">starts out being equal to this rate here</span> <span data-start="730.29" data-end="732.27">which is you know the initial value that</span> <span data-start="732.27" data-end="733.8">it's been given so we'll and that's a</span> <span data-start="733.8" data-end="736.08">medium strength constraint so we're</span> <span data-start="736.08" data-end="737.73">saying you know I'd like it to start out</span> <span data-start="737.73" data-end="741.27">at twenty-five percent then we'll say</span> <span data-start="741.27" data-end="743.64">that for example the third tax rate has</span> <span data-start="743.64" data-end="745.02">to be less than or equal to the fourth</span> <span data-start="745.02" data-end="746.79">tax rate you know we in general have a</span> <span data-start="746.79" data-end="749.01">progressive tax system so we're going to</span> <span data-start="749.01" data-end="750.39">we're going to hold that relationship</span> <span data-start="750.39" data-end="753.15">true finally we'll set up a variable</span> <span data-start="753.15" data-end="755.04">that's the number of dollars that we</span> <span data-start="755.04" data-end="758.34">earn for taxes at this rate and so the</span> <span data-start="758.34" data-end="760.29">tax revenue on the third tax rate is</span> <span data-start="760.29" data-end="762.3">equal to the third tax rate is a</span> <span data-start="762.3" data-end="764.22">percentage times the number of dollars</span> <span data-start="764.22" data-end="765.89">that are taxed in the third tax rate</span> <span data-start="765.89" data-end="769.41">that's pretty simple finally the we'll</span> <span data-start="769.41" data-end="771.33">get the sum total so the sum total that</span> <span data-start="771.33" data-end="773.07">we make in income taxes in a year is</span> <span data-start="773.07" data-end="776.46">basically the tax revenue variable for</span> <span data-start="776.46" data-end="779.97">each of these rates added together so</span> <span data-start="779.97" data-end="781.65">now in these few lines of code we've set</span> <span data-start="781.65" data-end="783.12">up a bunch of relationships that would</span> <span data-start="783.12" data-end="785.55">be a real pain to code by hand or a</span> <span data-start="785.55" data-end="787.23">whole

really interesting</span> <span data-start="791.16" data-end="793.65">emergent properties let's look at what</span> <span data-start="793.65" data-end="795.65">we get with just what we've done so far</span> <span data-start="795.65" data-end="799.14">so let's say that I'm really in so</span> <span data-start="799.14" data-end="801.15">obviously we can work forward as we've</span> <span data-start="801.15" data-end="802.32">already seen you know i can increase</span> <span data-start="802.32" data-end="805.83">taxes and that affects the deficit but i</span> <span data-start="805.83" data-end="807.78">can do something else let's say that i'm</span> <span data-start="807.78" data-end="809.64">not willing to cut any spending but i'm</span> <span data-start="809.64" data-end="811.26">really interested in cutting the deficit</span> <span data-start="811.26" data-end="813.57">and by the way none of these are my</span> <span data-start="813.57" data-end="816.63">political opinions is just let's say</span> <span data-start="816.63" data-end="819.66">that so I've locked spending</span> <span data-start="819.66" data-end="821.04">in place so we can't change that</span> <span data-start="821.04" data-end="823.62">variable and now as I cut the deficit</span> <span data-start="823.62" data-end="825.59">it's going to force tax rates to go up</span> <span data-start="825.59" data-end="828.75">kind of drastically and that's kind of</span> <span data-start="828.75" data-end="830.46">not fair i mean cassowary applied all</span> <span data-start="830.46" data-end="832.17">the tax increases to the very top tax</span> <span data-start="832.17" data-end="834.6">bracket maybe that's not what I want so</span> <span data-start="834.6" data-end="837.36">now I'll lock the deficit in place so</span> <span data-start="837.36" data-end="839.01">now when I make changes to taxes the</span> <span data-start="839.01" data-end="840.63">only thing castaway can do to solve my</span> <span data-start="840.63" data-end="842.97">problem is change the other tax rates so</span> <span data-start="842.97" data-end="845">as I decrease the tax rates on the top</span> <span data-start="845" data-end="847.44">group there it's going to force all</span> <span data-start="847.44" data-end="851.31">these others oh no good no good so I</span> <span data-start="851.31" data-end="852.63">guess that's not the solution to our</span> <span data-start="852.63" data-end="857.67">budget problems now what I want you to</span> <span data-start="857.67" data-end="859.77">see is that several very natural things</span> <span data-start="859.77" data-end="862.35">fell out of writing the relationships</span> <span data-start="862.35" data-end="863.97">that would have been a real pain to code</span> <span data-start="863.97" data-end="866.25">by hand you notice that as I drag the</span> <span data-start="866.25" data-end="869.01">tax the very top tax bracket lower all</span> <span data-start="869.01" data-end="870.81">the other ones kind of bunched up and</span> <span data-start="870.81"

the</span> <span data-start="884.01" data-end="886.02">interesting question like you know what</span> <span data-start="886.02" data-end="887.58">if we had the least progressive tax</span> <span
