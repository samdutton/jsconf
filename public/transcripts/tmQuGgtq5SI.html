<p><span data-start="5.2" data-end="13.35">So, I first did my first talk about CSS Grid all the way back in 2016.</span> <span data-start="13.35" data-end="21.53">At the time, it was only available in Firefox Nightly and Creme Canary, so I was making</span> <span data-start="21.53" data-end="24.58">things that people could not actually see.</span> <span data-start="24.58" data-end="32.3">I was using a whole bunch of brand new CSS features, leading-edge stuff.</span> <span data-start="32.3" data-end="39.71">Just experiment be making sometimes more abstract, weird experimental layouts rather than real</span> <span data-start="39.71" data-end="41.44">websites.</span> <span data-start="41.44" data-end="48.809">It was fun but it's not something you can do at work!</span> <span data-start="48.809" data-end="56.639">So now, of course, CSS Grid supported every where except internet explorer!</span> <span data-start="56.639" data-end="59.92">[Laughter].</span> <span data-start="59.92" data-end="62.82">It's a little frustrating, definitely.</span> <span data-start="62.82" data-end="67.57">Around the same time that I was playing with these brand new CSS features, I was reading</span> <span data-start="67.57" data-end="77.72">this book, so, it's basically all about progressive enhance ment.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="77.72" data-end="84.36">This is the idea that you can start off with semantic HTML and you can sort of slowly build</span> <span data-start="84.36" data-end="90.32">in layers, and, once you've got that base of solid semantic HTML, you just add some</span> <span data-start="90.32" data-end="94.59">CSS, you sprinkle on some JavaScript, and then you've got a website that every single</span> <span data-start="94.59" data-end="97.63">person can use.</span> <span data-start="97.63" data-end="102.22">Back then, his example was radius, right?</span> <span data-start="102.22" data-end="106.03">At the time the book came out, this wasn't widely supported.</span> <span data-start="106.03" data-end="111.98">Now, if you're on Opera Mini, even now, this still isn't supported but you can use it pretty</span> <span data-start="111.98" data-end="119.62">much everywhere else, and, if you're on one of those old browsers, if you're stuck on</span> <span data-start="119.62" data-end="131.54">perhaps IE4, I mean, on nature.com, we have 400 users on IE4, so these people are out</span> <span data-start="131.54" data-end="132.54">there somewhere.</span> <span data-start="132.54" data-end="136.939">I don't know what they're doing with their life!</span> <span data-start="136.939" data-end="140.56">These people will see a square, and it's like, okay, that's fine.</span> <span data-start="140.56" data-end="146.329">Let's take a far more modern example.</span> <span data-start="146.329" data-end="152.06">This is me — this is my personal website on Google Chrome.</span> <span data-start="152.06" data-end="155.42">This is my personal website on Firefox.</span> <span data-start="155.42" data-end="163.019">In this will be my personal web on Firefox.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="163.019" data-end="167.56">So there is a whole bunch of stuff we can use without really worrying about it, without</span> <span data-start="167.56" data-end="169.51">caring about it, without thinking about it.</span> <span data-start="169.51" data-end="176.31">If it doesn't work, it doesn't matter, our website is still fine.</span> <span data-start="176.31" data-end="180.5">Then we have layout stuff which of course is less fine.</span> <span data-start="180.5" data-end="185.65">We have to wait until every single browser in the whole world is actually supporting</span> <span data-start="185.65" data-end="189.62">this stuff before we feel we can use it on a production site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="189.62" data-end="197.829">So this is back in the day in 2016, this was — this was one of my first just little weird</span> <span data-start="197.829" data-end="203.09">experiments with CSS Grid, and so this is what it looked like back then in Knightly,</span> <span data-start="203.09" data-end="208.12">and Canary, and this is what it it looked like for everything else.</span> <span data-start="208.12" data-end="213.51">No thought into what what it will look like in other browsers.</span> <span data-start="213.51" data-end="219.629">There are today some big websites using CSS Grid.</span> <span data-start="219.629" data-end="223.29">This is the Guardian.</span> <span data-start="223.29" data-end="230.4">This is what it looks like in a browser that doesn't support CSS Grid.</span> <span data-start="230.4" data-end="232.609">This is the Financial Times.</span> <span data-start="232.609" data-end="239.15">Again, using CSS Grid in this very simple, basic way, not really using it for everything,</span> <span data-start="239.15" data-end="251.72">not really using it as much as it could do, and then here we have the FT in Internet Explorer,</span> <span data-start="251.72" data-end="257.35">you can see that it looks pretty decent and pretty good, but it is a different layout.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="257.35" data-end="261.41">It is a simpler layout.</span> <span data-start="261.41" data-end="267.57">It does mean their sidebar is now further down the page looking a little bit odd, but</span> <span data-start="267.57" data-end="274.92">it is still kind of fine, and I think if you're take these two different approaches, of making</span> <span data-start="274.92" data-end="281.66">the website look exactly the same, and kind of just making do with the best you can do</span> <span data-start="281.66" data-end="287.9">for Internet Explorer, I think this is only the approach that is really worth taking,</span> <span data-start="287.9" data-end="293.54">because otherwise, what you're doing, you're recreating the exact same layout in two different</span> <span data-start="293.54" data-end="300.17">ways, and I think a lot of us are just so excited about using CSS Grid that we're like,</span> <span data-start="300.17" data-end="305.19">yes, let's just use it, and then we have to deal with managers, when we have to deal with</span> <span data-start="305.19" data-end="311.03">product owners, when we have to deal with QA, they're like, "We will make it look exactly</span> <span data-start="311.03" data-end="317.181">the same," and you're just sending people more code, more CSS, and you're actually in</span> <span data-start="317.181" data-end="319.15">a way making things more complicated.</span> <span data-start="319.15" data-end="324.29">The whole reason we want to use CSS Grid is so we can do more exciting and experimental</span> <span data-start="324.29" data-end="330.33">layouts, more artfully directed layouts but partly because it makes our life easier.</span> <span data-start="330.33" data-end="335.54">As soon as you're writing two layouts to achieve the exact same thing, you're kind of losing</span> <span data-start="335.54" data-end="337.15">all the benefit.</span> <span data-start="337.15" data-end="341.91">I think the reality is we are going to have to make do.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="341.91" data-end="346.3">This year is a third example of a relatively large site.</span> <span data-start="346.3" data-end="347.62">This is Stripe.</span> <span data-start="347.62" data-end="352.35">Most of their customers are developers.</span> <span data-start="352.35" data-end="356.8">So they can be probably a bit more — make assumptions about what browsers people are</span> <span data-start="356.8" data-end="357.8">using.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="357.8" data-end="363.59">I'm sure their analytics show very few developers using Internet Explorer.</span> <span data-start="363.59" data-end="369.62">If you're a developer who chooses that browser out of choice, then I don't even know what</span> <span data-start="369.62" data-end="371.56">to say to that!</span> <span data-start="371.56" data-end="377.45">Firefox has undoubtedly what is becoming the best tooling for doing layout stuff, and this</span> <span data-start="377.45" data-end="383.43">will actually show you every single use of Grid on a web wage, so, this is Stripe.</span> <span data-start="383.43" data-end="385.72">You can see they've really gone to town.</span> <span data-start="385.72" data-end="391.59">They're using it all over the place to do what is really a quite interesting layout.</span> <span data-start="391.59" data-end="396.79">I've got to say, I think it is one of the best designs, websites I've really come across.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.79" data-end="400.63">I think they've done a really good job.</span> <span data-start="400.63" data-end="406.05">But, unfortunately, you know, this is what it looks like on internet explorer, which,</span> <span data-start="406.05" data-end="414.5">yes, it is not great, readable, legible, it's not even usable.</span> <span data-start="414.5" data-end="417.36">So these are the statistics as they are right now.</span> <span data-start="417.36" data-end="425.74">It's gone from being almost what seemed like the only browser to a tiny three per cent,</span> <span data-start="425.74" data-end="433.16">somewhat depressingly Edge actually is still used by fewer people than Internet Explorer.</span> <span data-start="433.16" data-end="442">Hopefully, we will see this drop down further, but every single one of these people on recent</span> <span data-start="442" data-end="449.77">versions of windows do actually have the option to open Edge whenever they want to, so I think</span> <span data-start="449.77" data-end="455.02">we're just talking about very stubborn people like, "Oh, my God, please just open Edge."</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="538.77" data-end="542.25">This is basically ly a hack.</span> <span data-start="542.25" data-end="548.98">This will make your CSS appear absolutely everywhere except Internet Explorer and old</span> <span data-start="548.98" data-end="550.58">browsers.</span> <span data-start="550.58" data-end="553.74">Because, we're not just talking about CSS Grid.</span> <span data-start="553.74" data-end="560.53">When we talk about internet explorer, this is a comparison of Internet Explorer 11 and</span> <span data-start="560.53" data-end="562.7">the latest version of Chrome.</span> <span data-start="562.7" data-end="569.98">If I zoom in closely, you will see this is a list of every single feature that Internet</span> <span data-start="569.98" data-end="576.99">Explorer 11 doesn't support with Chrome does support, and it's an ever-growing list, because</span> <span data-start="576.99" data-end="581.63">in Explorer right now, it's security updates only, right?</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="884.49" data-end="889.86">You can see the whole form is actually just inside of one single grid cell, and however</span> <span data-start="889.86" data-end="894.66">much stuff I put in the form, it's all going to be in a single cell, and as soon as you</span> <span data-start="894.66" data-end="902.54">put display contents on to the form, then things will be laid out into the two columns,</span> <span data-start="902.54" data-end="910.29">and so that will make Grid a lot, lot easier to work with for a lot of Edge cases that</span> <span data-start="910.29" data-end="912.66">you will run into.</span> </p>
