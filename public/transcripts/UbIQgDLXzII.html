like why</span> <span data-start="786.28" data-end="790.03">do we need so many things do we need yet</span> <span data-start="790.03" data-end="791.74">another build tool and yet another</span> <span

and</span> <span data-start="819.73" data-end="822.46">the more that we can stay open and allow</span> <span data-start="822.46" data-end="824.62">ourselves to experiment the more new</span> <span data-start="824.62" data-end="829.51">ideas that we can keep generating so I</span> <span data-start="829.51" data-end="831.94">really predict that in the following</span> <span data-start="831.94" data-end="833.38">years we're going to start to see a</span> <span data-start="833.38" data-end="837.64">shift from technical problems to more</span> <span data-start="837.64" data-end="840.07">human problems it's going to be about</span> <span data-start="840.07" data-end="842.71">the human connection tech will be a part</span> <span data-start="842.71" data-end="845.02">of what we do but it's not going to be</span> <span data-start="845.02" data-end="847">that first solution that we should jump</span> <span data-start="847" data-end="851.14">to right so we really need to take care</span> <span data-start="851.14" data-end="853.78">right now to make sure that we are</span> <span data-start="853.78" data-end="856.57">building helpful welcoming communities</span> <span data-start="856.57" data-end="858.58">that are going to celebrate diversity</span> <span data-start="858.58" data-end="862.51">and difference let's continue to ensure</span> <span data-start="862.51" data-end="865.66">that we are open and supportive to</span> <span data-start="865.66" data-end="868.81">everyone no matter beliefs skill set</span> <span data-start="868.81" data-end="872.86">skill

cliques</span> <span data-start="880.42" data-end="882.399">so what's incredibly wonderful and</span> <span data-start="882.399" data-end="883.87">encouraging to me and should be to</span> <span data-start="883.87" data-end="885.459">everyone is that we are actually</span> <span data-start="885.459" data-end="889.57">succeeding look at us here today the</span> <span data-start="889.57" data-end="891.639">organizers of this conference value</span> <span data-start="891.639" data-end="894.07">community value diversity and they and</span> <span data-start="894.07" data-end="898.62">they put that first and it's incredible</span> <span data-start="898.62" data-end="901.18">the second thing that I also found</span> <span data-start="901.18" data-end="902.8">really interesting that we might not</span> <span data-start="902.8" data-end="906.279">know is that at the same time that we've</span> <span data-start="906.279" data-end="908.56">been changing our behaviors we've</span> <span data-start="908.56" data-end="910.449">actually done so in a way that's</span> <span data-start="910.449" data-end="915.279">designed for resilience so this is a</span> <span data-start="915.279" data-end="920.41">small world network and what it how it</span> <span data-start="920.41" data-end="921.94">works is that you have these tightly</span> <span data-start="921.94" data-end="924.94">small connected groups that then have</span> <span data-start="924.94" data-end="927.55">loose connections to a larger group so</span> <span data-start="927.55" data-end="929.17">here like this would be kind of our</span> <span data-start="929.17" data-end="931.149">larger group and within this I'm sure we</span> <span data-start="931.149" data-end="932.949">have like tightly smaller groups like</span> <span data-start="932.949" data-end="935.74">see some of my SAS people over there and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="935.74" data-end="939.07">I'm sure there's no dl and every but and</span> <span data-start="939.07" data-end="941.94">despite that we have these tiny little</span> <span data-start="941.94" data-end="944.86">close connections and then we can branch</span> <span data-start="944.86" data-end="948.13">out and so small world networks are</span> <span data-start="948.13" data-end="952.24">actually incredibly advantageous they</span> <span data-start="952.24" data-end="955.42">first are resistant to damage which</span> <span data-start="955.42" data-end="958.66">makes us really strong and second they</span> <span data-start="958.66" data-end="961.6">transmit information really well we act</span> <span data-start="961.6" data-end="966.97">both as amplifiers and filters</span> <span data-start="966.98" data-end="969.98">so given that we are so skilled at</span> <span data-start="969.98" data-end="973.639">creating such a resilient network that</span> <span data-start="973.639" data-end="976.1">is based on valuing contributions and</span> <span data-start="976.1" data-end="978.199">the uniqueness of every community member</span> <span data-start="978.199" data-end="980.72">and the fact that we can do this in such</span> <span data-start="980.72" data-end="983.93">a short amount of time I really believe</span> <span data-start="983.93" data-end="985.72">that we have a lot to contribute back to</span> <span data-start="985.72" data-end="990.339">society beyond just beautiful websites</span> <span data-start="990.339" data-end="993.199">so citizens the world over are calling</span> <span data-start="993.199" data-end="996.98">for a change and I really believe along</span> <span data-start="996.98" data-end="999.139">with many others that this change is</span> <span data-start="999.139" data-end="1001.3">only going to come to a participatory</span> <span data-start="1001.3" data-end="1004.329">revolution we're the same design</span> <span data-start="1004.329" data-end="1007.089">decisions that made our tools so great</span> <span data-start="1007.089" data-end="1010.089">and allowed them to succeed are applied</span> <span data-start="1010.089" data-end="1013.079">to other systems like urban planning and</span> <span data-start="1013.079" data-end="1018.18">education so we developers and designers</span> <span data-start="1018.18" data-end="1021.31">have an immensely valuable perspective</span> <span data-start="1021.31" data-end="1024.13">to share beyond just our tech</span> <span data-start="1024.13" data-end="1027.85">communities we are successful practicing</span> <span data-start="1027.85"

data-end="1037.48">my mind we are leaders of one of the</span> <span data-start="1037.48" data-end="1042.04">largest movements in the world so being</span> <span data-start="1042.04"
