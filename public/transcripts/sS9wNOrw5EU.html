<p><span data-start="18.085" data-end="19.085"><span class="speaker">Thomas</span>: Good morning. Thanks for being here early for this talk. I want to give a huge</span> <span data-start="19.085" data-end="20.085">thanks to JSConf for having me. They have been awesome. So grateful to be here. I also</span> <span data-start="20.085" data-end="23.4">want to thank any open source contributors. Because I feel like I'm using cheat code sometimes,</span> <span data-start="23.4" data-end="29.9">just like using someone else's code. If you're anything like me, I may have squirmed a little</span> <span data-start="29.9" data-end="36.289">bit at this AI acronym. And that's good. We're going through that today. But just your willingness</span> <span data-start="36.289" data-end="42.469">to be here, shows you're open to the ideas and pushing the boundaries. I think that's</span> <span data-start="42.469" data-end="49.28">commendable. Thanks for being here. Okay. My name's Thomas Drach like we talked about.</span> <span data-start="49.28" data-end="55.209">Thomasdrach on Twitter if you want to bug me there, please do. I consider myself a designer</span> <span data-start="55.209" data-end="62.589">and a bit of a hacker. Not in the sense of this awesome movie. But in the writing bad</span> <span data-start="62.589" data-end="70.45">code sense. I'm really good at that. I have a little design studio called Subtract where</span> <span data-start="70.45" data-end="75.88">I make what I hope are useful products. One of which we'll go through today. And I have</span> <span data-start="75.88" data-end="85.32">a product called Cleverstack too if you want to check that out. So, I want to start with</span> <span data-start="85.32" data-end="92.48">a man called Paul Thomas. He had a little garage in Phoenix called the Thomas Brothers</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="92.48" data-end="107.02">Garage. Today people might call him an entrepreneur or a founder. But he was actually an inventor.</span> <span data-start="107.02" data-end="111.13">He filed for over a hundred patents and I'm still trying to track most of them down. I</span> <span data-start="111.13" data-end="116.06">found about a dozen of them. Most reminded me of the Rube Goldberg machines. I don't</span> <span data-start="116.06" data-end="122.229">know if you have seen these before. They're simple machines that create this weird trap</span> <span data-start="122.229" data-end="128.969">like mechanism. All the patents I found from him were complex machines like that. Like</span> <span data-start="128.969" data-end="133.54">nothing you would actually use. It's kind of hard to see here. But the name of this</span> <span data-start="133.54" data-end="139.239">one is panel manufacturing method. And it's basically a patent for this giant machine</span> <span data-start="139.239" data-end="144.4">that creates these like brick and concrete slabs and then we're supposed to ship them</span> <span data-start="144.4" data-end="149.859">to job are sites for people to build houses with them. Kind of made me sad a little bit</span> <span data-start="149.859" data-end="154.64">because it just seemed like a crazy person was documenting and patenting all of these</span> <span data-start="154.64" data-end="161.959">things. But the machines that get built. This is the one that we were just talking about.</span> <span data-start="161.959" data-end="169.65">The manufacturing machine to make the giant slabs. And they actually had to design and</span> <span data-start="169.65" data-end="176.329">patent these, like, semitrucks to ship them to job sites. They had these weird little</span> <span data-start="176.329" data-end="183.371">trucks that would like transport like these palettes of bricks everywhere. And clearly</span> <span data-start="183.371" data-end="189.98">they didn't invent the screw or the lever or the racket pinion or these things, but</span> <span data-start="189.98" data-end="197.03">they combined something to make something new and useful. And it's especially interesting</span> <span data-start="197.03" data-end="205.109">to me because this man was my great grandfather and my namesake. Some of you might be familiar</span> <span data-start="205.109" data-end="211.849">with this Henry Ford quote. The funny thing is, Henry Ford never said this. I did research</span> <span data-start="211.849" data-end="220.26">and the first time it was attributed to him was in 1999 in the cruise industry news quarterly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="220.26" data-end="226.43">And other people started using it and now people say it on stages like this. Sometimes</span> <span data-start="226.43" data-end="231.43">it's paired with like the Steve Jobs quote and kind of create this is genius complex</span> <span data-start="231.43" data-end="238.129">of, they didn't know what they want. We have to show them or whatever. But I think there's</span> <span data-start="238.129" data-end="242.73">something that people miss about this quote in particular. I think it resonates for a</span> <span data-start="242.73" data-end="248.29">reason. But my interpretation of this quote is, big progress isn't necessarily just like</span> <span data-start="248.29" data-end="254.269">an iteration of the last thing, but it's like a mutation of something that happened before.</span> <span data-start="254.269" data-end="264.39">Maybe a little bit like this. We could accidently combine a few unrelated things to find something</span> <span data-start="264.39" data-end="270.48">new. This is Tim Berners Lee talking about inventing the Internet. He said I just had</span> <span data-start="270.48" data-end="275.15">to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TC P&D NS ideas and can be ta da, I</span> <span data-start="275.15" data-end="288.09">had the World Wide Web. There's an old LinkedIn, his profile page, it just said like web developer.</span> <span data-start="288.09" data-end="292.85">But he goes on this interview, and I recommend listening or reading interviews from him.</span> <span data-start="292.85" data-end="299.49">He goes on just to attribute all these other inventions and says if these didn't happen,</span> <span data-start="299.49" data-end="304.71">the Internet, at least I wouldn't have created it at that time. I don't know what would have</span> <span data-start="304.71" data-end="311.42">happened. So, the definition of mutation in the dictionary is the changing of structure,</span> <span data-start="311.42" data-end="320.58">resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations. Hendrix famously</span> <span data-start="320.58" data-end="327.4">took right handed guitars, flipped them upside down and then eventually changed music. And</span> <span data-start="327.4" data-end="333.551">he did so in part because it was before Les Paul invented the electronic guitar. They</span> <span data-start="333.551" data-end="342.17">didn't invent it to invent it, but because they wanted the acoustic guitar louder. And</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="342.17" data-end="347.67">Grace Hopper, is one of the inventers of what we now call programming. A big reason we're</span> <span data-start="347.67" data-end="356.1">here today. And she started with knobs and switches on the Mark I. All of these were</span> <span data-start="356.1" data-end="366.21">mutations. Like it was different enough. Hopper's was a mutation. And I think AI is a built</span> <span data-start="366.21" data-end="372.07">of a mutation, at least how we talk about it today. There's much more data, advances</span> <span data-start="372.07" data-end="376.55">in machine learning, compute power thanks to Moore's Law. And it kind of created the</span> <span data-start="376.55" data-end="385.04">opportunity for something like AI to work. This is what I get when I search "AI" on Google.</span> <span data-start="385.04" data-end="391.51">I don't know about you. But this isn't very helpful for me. So, I'll ask a little bit</span> <span data-start="391.51" data-end="396.56">different question today. I want to ask, what are intelligent machines? We might be able</span> <span data-start="396.56" data-end="406.7">to define this. Just intelligence + machines. So, let's define intelligence. This is a quote;</span> <span data-start="406.7" data-end="411.49">I'm just going to read it really quick. People generally distrust the concept of machines</span> <span data-start="411.49" data-end="417.21">that approach and thus why not pass our own human intelligence. I think a lot of people</span> <span data-start="417.21" data-end="422.82">feel like this today. And this quote was actually written in 1970 in the book called the architecture</span> <span data-start="422.82" data-end="430.37">machine actually by the person who founded the MIT Media Lab. And it goes on to say that,</span> <span data-start="430.37" data-end="434.81">machines must be aware of their context in order to be intelligent. So, you can't have</span> <span data-start="434.81" data-end="441">like a machine without using the context, interacting with the world. It's not intelligent</span> <span data-start="441" data-end="448.55">in that case. There's no lack of context in the new Tesla roadsters. So, for our purposes,</span> <span data-start="448.55" data-end="456.14">and I'm just gonna say intelligence means using context. So, now we can define machines.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="456.14" data-end="460.95">This should be pretty easy. We go to the dictionary and find a mechanically, electronically, or</span> <span data-start="460.95" data-end="471.02">electrically operated device for a task. Sounds good to me. Okay. So, with intelligence and</span> <span data-start="471.02" data-end="476.88">machines defined, I would like to introduce you to the concept of somewhat intelligent</span> <span data-start="476.88" data-end="483.7">machines. And this is what we're gonna build today. And this is just something that uses</span> <span data-start="483.7" data-end="490.45">context and rapidly completes something that a human could not. And we're gonna do all</span> <span data-start="490.45" data-end="499.86">of it in JavaScript. So, this is the actual machine instrument, musician, AI, whatever</span> <span data-start="499.86" data-end="503.28">you want to call it. This is what we're gonna build today. I'm going to walk through how</span> <span data-start="503.28" data-end="509.81">to generate drumbeats using pre trained machine learning models, APIs, libraries, stuff like</span> <span data-start="509.81" data-end="515.52">that. We're going to piece it together. And I find it a little bit hard for me to follow</span> <span data-start="515.52" data-end="521.7">tiny code so it's gonna be a little pseudo codey. Like I said, the first thing we needed</span> <span data-start="521.7" data-end="529.86">were a couple libraries\hwe're going to use Magenta. If you haven't heard of Magenta already,</span> <span data-start="529.86" data-end="534.58">please check it out. It's incredible. A couple of people have talked about it already here</span> <span data-start="534.58" data-end="541.41">at JSConf. And then we're going to use Tone, which is actually a dependency Magenta which</span> <span data-start="541.41" data-end="550.071">gives us an easier to code interface for musical stuff. All right. Let's play some drums. This</span> <span data-start="550.071" data-end="556.99">is what the data structure for the drums will look like. You can set up a step sequence,</span> <span data-start="556.99" data-end="564.77">but this is a step sequence in Magenta. There's a pitch, there's an attribute that tells it's</span> <span data-start="564.77" data-end="571.56">a sample based pitch, not a tonal keyboard like thing. And there's quantization info.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="571.56" data-end="578.76">There's a method that does that for you so you don't have to worry about it. Okay. So,</span> <span data-start="578.76" data-end="582.94">all we need to play that note sequence is two lines of code. We're going to create a</span> <span data-start="582.94" data-end="588.82">new instance in the Magenta music player. And I'm going to call it player.star on that.</span> <span data-start="588.82" data-end="594.47">And we're gonna get something like this. [drumbeats]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="594.47" data-end="601.75">This is just our basic pattern that we plugged in. Right? It's not that exciting. We kind</span> <span data-start="601.75" data-end="607.68">of want something a little bit more like this. Like feed it in and we'll get something better</span> <span data-start="607.68" data-end="614.14">in the material. All right. But in order to do that and do super quick ML crash course.</span> <span data-start="614.14" data-end="620.08">I am not the one to go in depth about this. But let's all get on the same page. Okay.</span> <span data-start="620.08" data-end="625.63">So, usually write functions something like this. We want something, we put something</span> <span data-start="625.63" data-end="631.32">in, we want something back. Machine learning, it's a little bit more abstract, right? We</span> <span data-start="631.32" data-end="639.12">don't know abstractly like what we\h how we would get there. Like, is this image a dog?</span> <span data-start="639.12" data-end="644.22">Here's the image. I don't know. Some of you might see\h</span> <span data-start="644.22" data-end="647.58">[ Laughter ] Memes like this. This is one of my favorites.</span> <span data-start="647.58" data-end="654.79">Chicken fingers and the goldendoodles, I think. I don't know how dogs and cats became like</span> <span data-start="654.79" data-end="662.62">the hello world of machine learning. But I'm not mad about it. So, here's what we call</span> <span data-start="662.62" data-end="668.11">training data. If it was training data, it was probably labeled. So, this is a dog. I</span> <span data-start="668.11" data-end="673.77">probably should have said like fried chicken. That's not an actual chicken. So, you feed</span> <span data-start="673.77" data-end="678.66">all that to the machine. The machine says all these are dogs. They have this weird odd</span> <span data-start="678.66" data-end="685.46">thing on their face. We call that a feature. That feature to us looks like a nose. The</span> <span data-start="685.46" data-end="690.14">machine goes, okay, there's a nose. It's probably a dog. So, we feed them the image and it's</span> <span data-start="690.14" data-end="698.29">gonna guess, dog. All of these are just like probabilities. For our purposes, we want to</span> <span data-start="698.29" data-end="704.29">give it some drums and we want some better drums in turn. So, that's where Magenta comes</span> <span data-start="704.29" data-end="710.64">in. Magenta has a couple different models available. All of these are super cool and</span> <span data-start="710.64" data-end="715.96">it seems like they're coming out with more every week, every month. So, there's a MusicRNN</span> <span data-start="715.96" data-end="724.74">model, a Music VAE and a Piano Genie. Right now the Piano Genie is a VAI as well. Just</span> <span data-start="724.74" data-end="733.12">quick, RNN stands for recounter neural network, a bunch of nodes. It's like one of those.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.12" data-end="739.98">But it loops through itself. And a VAE is a variational auto\hencoder. If you're familiar</span> <span data-start="739.98" data-end="745.55">with encoding and decoding, it works similarly to that. For our purposes, we're going to</span> <span data-start="745.55" data-end="752.12">use the MusicRNN models just in the context of Magenta. They have a little bit better</span> <span data-start="752.12" data-end="758.3">support for like individual instruments like drums. And this is kind of what that might</span> <span data-start="758.3" data-end="762.691">look like. So, if you have nodes on the network, you have it looping through itself and you</span> <span data-start="762.691" data-end="767.4">have an in and an out. For us, we're going to put in our initial drum beat and we're</span> <span data-start="767.4" data-end="776.331">going to expect a generated drum beat in return. Okay. So, we picked our MusicRNN models. This</span> <span data-start="776.331" data-end="782.19">is what the actual checkpoint is. So, this is like a pre trained model. Trained with</span> <span data-start="782.19" data-end="787.89">millions of drumbeats and it has a sense of what drumbeats are. There's a kick on one,</span> <span data-start="787.89" data-end="794.51">there's a snare on two or something like that. So, these are the three lines of code that</span> <span data-start="794.51" data-end="800.79">we need to generate a new drumbeat. So, you just create a new instance of our MusicRNN</span> <span data-start="800.79" data-end="806.21">model, the checkpoint that we had. We initialize the model, it loads\hitself up. And then we</span> <span data-start="806.21" data-end="811.42">call this method continue sequence. We feed it in our note sequence, feed the number of</span> <span data-start="811.42" data-end="818">steps which is kind of arbitrary. Could be 16, 32 or whatever. And then we feed it a</span> <span data-start="818" data-end="825.07">number from zero to two. We'll go over the temperature a little bit letter. So, after</span> <span data-start="825.07" data-end="830.94">we do that, we just get a sample in return and we play the same way we played the other</span> <span data-start="830.94" data-end="837.32">one. So, this is what that looked like. This is gonna be generated beat with a temperature</span> <span data-start="837.32" data-end="839.59">of 1.5. [[drumbeat]</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="839.59" data-end="857.529">And if you generate it again, it's going to come up with now beats that we've never heard.</span> <span data-start="857.529" data-end="862.15">Cool. So, yeah. [ Applause ] all right. That was cool. But</span> <span data-start="862.15" data-end="867.1">it was a little bit of a blackbox. So, I want to go through what happens when we call them</span> <span data-start="867.1" data-end="872.97">with a continue sequence. We call it here in the three lines are of code. All we're</span> <span data-start="872.97" data-end="877.83">gonna do here is what's happening behind the scenes is we're gonna convert the note sequence</span> <span data-start="877.83" data-end="883.71">which is that drum thing. We're going to convert it to a Tensor. And then we're going to encode</span> <span data-start="883.71" data-end="887.93">the tensor to match the model, the checkpoint that you have. If you're wondering what a</span> <span data-start="887.93" data-end="896.49">tensor is, you probably already know. If you remember municipal math, is scalars and vectors.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="896.49" data-end="904.06">A tensor has three dimensions. That's why you hair the word shape when talking about</span> <span data-start="904.06" data-end="915.459">machine learning. And especially TensorFlow. These are all\h but the last is tensor. And</span> <span data-start="915.459" data-end="923.779">then there's an internal method called sampleRNN. The inputs go into the TensorFlow library</span> <span data-start="923.779" data-end="930.14">and generates the next notes. If you want to get into the nitty gritty, TensorFlow.JS</span> <span data-start="930.14" data-end="936.3">is a great place to actually get your hands dirty there. It helps me to visualize like</span> <span data-start="936.3" data-end="942.529">this. Once more, the continueSequence. And the note here, the noteSequence, convert it</span> <span data-start="942.529" data-end="952.29">to a model, call the sampleRNN and get the new drums. I told you we were gonna talk about</span> <span data-start="952.29" data-end="957.58">temperature. It's interesting to me because it's one of the few inputs we have available.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="957.58" data-end="962.8">Restructure train it with different drumbeats, which is kind of cool. But temperature is</span> <span data-start="962.8" data-end="969.89">like the level of entropy in the system. So, the lower the temperature, the more predictable</span> <span data-start="969.89" data-end="976.62">result we're gonna get. The higher, the less predictable it will be. So, just as an example,</span> <span data-start="976.62" data-end="981.11">and drop it down here to 0.2. Sounds like really similar to the original</span> <span data-start="981.11" data-end="993.42">drumbeat. And if we keep generating it, it's pretty much like the same, right? So, now</span> <span data-start="993.42" data-end="1003.98">we're gonna try cranking it up to 1.5. [Drumbeats\h ]</span> <span data-start="1003.98" data-end="1018.1">So, a little bit more exciting, for sure. This is the temperature I like. More fun.</span> <span data-start="1018.1" data-end="1025.48">And after we do that, we just have like a little demo button here. It will generate</span> <span data-start="1025.48" data-end="1031.799">a new file. And then sometimes what I will do is I will drop it in this, garage band</span> <span data-start="1031.799" data-end="1037.51">and use it as a musician for my band. If you're wondering why there's no audio right now,</span> <span data-start="1037.51" data-end="1043.63">it's because we're not judging my music skills today. We're talking about JavaScript. Okay.</span> <span data-start="1043.63" data-end="1052.22">So, that was cool. It was like almost somewhat intelligent. I wanted to take it one step</span> <span data-start="1052.22" data-end="1058.71">further. So, I wanted to give the machine a little bit of motivation with applause.</span> <span data-start="1058.71" data-end="1067.19">So, depending on how much you applaud it, the machine would then generate a new temperature.</span> <span data-start="1067.19" data-end="1074.299">Here we go. The machine would generate a new temperature based on like the average amplitude</span> <span data-start="1074.299" data-end="1082.2">of a couple seconds period of time. I wanted more context to have a better definition of</span> <span data-start="1082.2" data-end="1089.4">our somewhat intelligent machine. So, I literally injected more context into it. So, this is</span> <span data-start="1089.4" data-end="1094.41">pretty simple. I'm just getting the user's microphone. And I have this little method</span> <span data-start="1094.41" data-end="1101.53">here called analyze sound. I'm going to use create script processer and just take the</span> <span data-start="1101.53" data-end="1109.27">average volume over a couple seconds. Okay. And against my better judgment, we're gonna</span> <span data-start="1109.27" data-end="1124.62">do a live demo. Okay. So, this is the drumbeat. That's the normal drum beat we programmed</span> <span data-start="1124.62" data-end="1138.27">in. Then we can generate one. Drop it down a little bit. So, this is like pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1138.27" data-end="1148.46">Generating a new one every time. Okay. Now I need your help. So, I've created</span> <span data-start="1148.46" data-end="1155.7">this little perform feature. When I click the button, it's going to wait for applause</span> <span data-start="1155.7" data-end="1159.96">for a couple seconds and then it's gonna take that average amplitude over that period of</span> <span data-start="1159.96" data-end="1165.71">time, decide on what temperature to play, and then generate the beat based on that.</span> <span data-start="1165.71" data-end="1173.38">I promise I'm not trying to manufacture applause for myself. Maybe a little bit. Okay. So,</span> <span data-start="1173.38" data-end="1182.77">let's try this. On the count of three, be like nice. But loud. I'm\h on the count of</span> <span data-start="1182.77" data-end="1187.08">three, start applauding. I'm going to hit the button right after you start applauding</span> <span data-start="1187.08" data-end="1194.67">and then we'll see what happens. Live demos always work. So with, this should be great.</span> <span data-start="1194.67" data-end="1200.11">On the count of three, one, two, three. [ Applause ]</span> <span data-start="1200.11" data-end="1214.03">Yeah! All right. So, that's that. So, it actually goes from like zero to 2. It goes up pretty\h</span> <span data-start="1214.03" data-end="1224.5">it still is morning. But you're being considerate. I'm fine with that. Cool. So, that's that.</span> <span data-start="1224.5" data-end="1231.51">That is our somewhat intelligent machine. So, did we use context? I think so. We put</span> <span data-start="1231.51" data-end="1239.75">in our drumbeat. We took applause. We told it the steps we wanted. It definitely rapidly</span> <span data-start="1239.75" data-end="1244.169">completed something that we couldn't do on our own, right? We can generate like a dozen</span> <span data-start="1244.169" data-end="1252.13">or so drumbeats just in a couple seconds. So, I think we did it. Other people have created</span> <span data-start="1252.13" data-end="1260.27">some really cool things. This is called a neural computer. Usually play a couple notes,</span> <span data-start="1260.27" data-end="1266.919">an arpeggio, bounce back and forth. But this will take the temperature into effect. It</span> <span data-start="1266.919" data-end="1277.15">uses the improvRNN model from Magenta. I really like it. The Magenta team created</span> <span data-start="1277.15" data-end="1284.07">kind of like what we just did, but inside of able10. If you use it, you can do what</span> <span data-start="1284.07" data-end="1296.09">we just did, and generate right inside. And the Flaming Lips actually created this thing</span> <span data-start="1296.09" data-end="1302.01">called the framing\h the Flaming Lips and Magenta created this thing called Fruit Genie.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1302.01" data-end="1310.141">And it was fruit, but it would say like orange and it would feed the model. And then they</span> <span data-start="1310.141" data-end="1315.69">created like these giant pool toy type things that had censors on them and then threw them</span> <span data-start="1315.69" data-end="1322.34">into the audience and asked people to feed it into the same model and create this, like,</span> <span data-start="1322.34" data-end="1328.12">melody. This is a little clip of what that looked like.</span> <span data-start="1328.12" data-end="1333.23"Audience member: Written this song especially for tonight's occasion.</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1333.23" data-end="1341.71"><span class="speaker">Thomas</span>: So, they threw out these things into the audience. And people\h and you could hear</span> <span data-start="1341.71" data-end="1346.87">it in the melody like cycle back. There's not like\h</span> <span data-start="1346.87" data-end="1354.679"Audience member: Apple\h THOMAS: So, all of these things, all the stuff</span> <span data-start="1354.679" data-end="1362.38">we just talked about. All of it was just Tone.js and Magenta and we created our own as well.</span> <span data-start="1362.38" data-end="1369.17">We used a couple other previous inventions, sure. But that was kind of the point, right?</span> <span data-start="1369.17" data-end="1375.23">Combining these simple machines to kind of create something more complex. We didn't reinvent</span> <span data-start="1375.23" data-end="1382.91">the wheel, by any means. We didn't have to. We just created something a little bit smarter</span> <span data-start="1382.91" data-end="1389.179">than it was before with the tools that I had at our disposal. I think we can keep doing</span> <span data-start="1389.179" data-end="1392.549">this. We can keep like flipping our tools and creating things that are new and useful</span> <span data-start="1392.549" data-end="1400.11">for people and helpful and interesting. And hopefully the inventions that we piece together,</span> <span data-start="1400.11" data-end="1407.01">the sum will be greater than its parts. This is such an exciting time to be building stuff.</span> <span data-start="1407.01" data-end="1410.304">And I can't wait to see what we all build next. So, thank you.</span> <span data-start="1410.304" data-end="1411.304">[ Applause ] KATIE: Wow. Oh, my gosh, all right, I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="1411.304" data-end="1412.304">gush for a second about the Flaming Lips. They're one of my favorite bands. I've seen</span> <span data-start="1412.304" data-end="1413.304">them live four or five times. If you haven't seen them, even if you don't particularly</span> <span data-start="1413.304" data-end="1414.304">love their music, it's an amazing experience. You should go and do it. I'm going to stop</span> <span data-start="1414.304" data-end="1415.304">gushing about the Flaming Lips and now I'm going to gush about Thomas. That was really</span> <span data-start="1415.304" data-end="1416.304">cool and I really love his message that, you know, like he's not some kind of crazy genius.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1416.304" data-end="1417.304">He's just like a person who is really into music and really wanted to try something cool.</span> <span data-start="1417.304" data-end="1418.304">And that we all could do this with JavaScript. It's like amazing, right? Anyway, so, coming</span> <span data-start="1418.304" data-end="1419.304">up next we have Sophia Shoemaker is going to talk about building a PWA that had to work</span> <span data-start="1419.304" data-end="1420.304">off the grid in an African country which I can't remember which one, but we need to be</span> <span data-start="1420.304" data-end="1421.304">back here at 10:30 for that. So, you have a couple minutes to go out and switch rooms</span> <span data-start="1421.304" data-end="1422.304">if you want. But you shouldn't. You should stay here. All right. Thanks, everybody.</span> </p>
