<p><span data-start="601.05" data-end="603.54">I promised I would talk more about scope</span> <span data-start="603.54" data-end="606.81">so basically scope is this context</span> <span

that's</span> <span data-start="634.74" data-end="636.36">what lexical scoping is all about and</span> <span data-start="636.36" data-end="637.529">that's why scoping can only happen</span> <span

data-start="640.62" data-end="643.38">execution context and one interesting</span> <span data-start="643.38" data-end="644.97">thing to note about variable</span> <span data-start="644.97"

that's I know</span> <span data-start="663.06" data-end="664.29">that's like super crazy but if you have</span> <span data-start="664.29" data-end="665.61">a top-level function that's why the</span> <span data-start="665.61" data-end="667.769">value of this applies to the window</span> <span data-start="667.769" data-end="670.41">because it at that point like after it's</span> <span data-start="670.41" data-end="672.089">been processed that function itself is</span> <span data-start="672.089" data-end="675.9">now a member of the global object</span> <span data-start="675.91" data-end="677.99">and another way to like think about the</span> <span data-start="677.99" data-end="680.08">value is this as it points to the object</span> <span data-start="680.08" data-end="683.69">at which the function is applied so I</span> <span data-start="683.69" data-end="686.18">know that's super tricky okay so that's</span> <span data-start="686.18" data-end="689.81">creation it's kind of crazy and I hope I</span> <span data-start="689.81" data-end="691.49">explained it in a coherent way we'll see</span> <span data-start="691.49" data-end="693.529">that remains to be seen but after that</span> <span data-start="693.529" data-end="695.81">activation so basically after a function</span> <span data-start="695.81" data-end="698.75">has been created it runs and the the</span> <span data-start="698.75" data-end="702.77">code execution stage begins okay so I</span> <span data-start="702.77" data-end="704.42">just wanted to take a moment to talk</span> <span data-start="704.42" data-end="709.52">briefly about closures because I have a</span> <span data-start="709.52" data-end="711.89">feeling that or I know I personally</span> <span data-start="711.89" data-end="713.51">until I really learned about the</span> <span data-start="713.51" data-end="715.31">variable object of scoping and like what</span> <span data-start="715.31" data-end="716.96">that truly means I had no idea really</span> <span data-start="716.96" data-end="719.21">what closures were about and so I have a</span> <span data-start="719.21" data-end="720.68">kind of complicated definition up here</span> <span data-start="720.68" data-end="722.75">but I'm going to simplify it but</span> <span data-start="722.75" data-end="724.19">basically a closure is formed when an</span> <span data-start="724.19" data-end="725.42">inner function is made accessible</span> <span data-start="725.42" data-end="727.01">outside of the function which was</span> <span data-start="727.01" data-end="728.57">contained so imagine if you had an inner</span> <span data-start="728.57" data-end="730.4">function the outer function returns that</span> <span data-start="730.4" data-end="732.74">inner function so basically what's</span> <span data-start="732.74" data-end="734.57">happening there is the inner function</span> <span data-start="734.57" data-end="736.339">contains a reference to its parents</span> <span data-start="736.339" data-end="737.54">variable object and when you actually</span> <span data-start="737.54" data-end="741.41">return it you make that available for</span> <span data-start="741.41" data-end="742.67">when that inner function is executed</span> <span data-start="742.67" data-end="746.51">outside of of its normal context you've</span> <span data-start="746.51" data-end="748.16">effectively closed over that variable</span> <span data-start="748.16" data-end="751.58">object and make it available um and so</span> <span data-start="751.58" data-end="753.62">that's what that's all about and I truly</span> <span data-start="753.62" data-end="754.85">did not think I would blow through that</span> <span data-start="754.85" data-end="758.81">so quickly but I did I'm really happy to</span> <span data-start="758.81" data-end="768.84">answer questions if anyone hasn't</span> <span data-start="768.85" data-end="772.43">so yeah are there any questions out</span> <span data-start="772.43" data-end="775.76">there I can bring you a mic and your can</span> <span data-start="775.76" data-end="777.77">just find me either on the internet or</span> <span data-start="777.77" data-end="779.39">in real life you can talk to me about</span> <span data-start="779.39" data-end="784.34">this oh we do we have a question so when</span> <span data-start="784.34" data-end="789.05">you talked about the I forget whether it</span> <span data-start="789.05" data-end="790.67">was the context object or something we</span> <span data-start="790.67" data-end="793.43">have the activation record and all that</span> <span data-start="793.43" data-end="793.91">stuff</span> <span data-start="793.91" data-end="796.22">are there any interpreters where this</span> <span data-start="796.22" data-end="799.46">object is actually exposed no it's just</span> <span data-start="799.46" data-end="801.26">like an implementation construct so it's</span> <span data-start="801.26" data-end="802.58">just something that happens behind the</span> <span data-start="802.58" data-end="804.14">scenes and it's not an actual object</span> <span data-start="804.14" data-end="805.88">like I just think about it that way like</span> <span data-start="805.88" data-end="807.56">it doesn't have a prototype or anything</span> <span data-start="807.56" data-end="811.46">like that it's just like basically it</span> <span

they should</span> <span data-start="825.35" data-end="826.76">actually expose these kind of things</span> <span data-start="826.76" data-end="828.59">because you can do this I mean small</span> <span data-start="828.59" data-end="831.35">talk did this and and other languages do</span> <span data-start="831.35" data-end="832.58">this and you can do some really fun</span> <span data-start="832.58" data-end="835.73">stuff that sounds super fun it sounds</span> <span data-start="835.73" data-end="836.93">like you're adding complexity it makes</span> <span data-start="836.93" data-end="838.61">me nervous yeah you're gonna fight with</span> <span data-start="838.61" data-end="842.75">eval and I friends yeah a couple people</span> <span data-start="842.75" data-end="844.46">wanted to like kill me when I said that</span> <span data-start="844.46" data-end="848.72">we have any other questions yeah II</span> <span data-start="848.72" data-end="850.4">thought wasn't inherently bad it's just</span> <span data-start="850.4" data-end="853.31">inherently dangerous right but I just</span> <span data-start="853.31" data-end="857.21">prefer not to talk about it hey Martha</span> <span data-start="857.21" data-end="859.46">can you spend the word on block scopes</span> <span data-start="859.46" data-end="862.37">oh yeah so one of the tricky things</span> <span data-start="862.37" data-end="864.77">about JavaScript is it looks a lot like</span> <span data-start="864.77" data-end="866.87">see like it kind of borrowed a lot of</span> <span data-start="866.87" data-end="868.67">the same syntax so and see everything is</span> <span data-start="868.67" data-end="871.76">scoped its scoped by block so like an if</span> <span data-start="871.76" data-end="873.89">statement or something like there the</span> <span data-start="873.89" data-end="875.48">scope would be contained within that</span> <span data-start="875.48" data-end="879.23">block but unfortunately it / fortunately</span> <span data-start="879.23" data-end="883.13">for us with an javascript scope is not</span> <span data-start="883.13" data-end="884.87">defined within like an if statement it's</span> <span data-start="884.87" data-end="887.9">only defined within a function so that's</span> <span data-start="887.9" data-end="889.34">why if you train like reference a</span> <span data-start="889.34" data-end="890.63">variable inside like a for loop or</span> <span data-start="890.63" data-end="892.37">something it's not actually scoped</span> <span data-start="892.37"

data-start="912.339" data-end="915.61">time I have no idea how I rambled so</span> <span data-start="915.61" data-end="923.529">quickly so is it ever possible to point</span> <span

data-end="930.339">there's always a references up yeah</span> <span data-start="930.339" data-end="931.45">that's actually happens for you</span> <span data-start="931.45" data-end="933.82">implicitly

data-end="947.2">way up to the global level so right so</span> <span data-start="947.2" data-end="948.37">you can always like access named</span> <span data-start="948.37" data-end="950.17">properties of like the parent scope but</span> <span data-start="950.17" data-end="951.52">you can never reference it directly</span> <span data-start="951.52" data-end="954.73">right like parent this only if your turn</span> <span data-start="954.73" data-end="958.839">it returned a reference to that to like</span> <span data-start="958.839" data-end="960.37">what the context inside the function</span> <span data-start="960.37" data-end="961.93">outside like a closure like that be the</span> <span data-start="961.93" data-end="965.14">only way that you could do that or</span> <span data-start="965.14" data-end="969.49">window or global and node don't do that</span> <span data-start="969.49" data-end="979.12">though can you talk about just kind of I</span> <span data-start="979.12" data-end="981.339">guess how you got started with reading</span> <span data-start="981.339" data-end="984.54">more into the actual implementation yeah</span> <span data-start="984.54" data-end="986.95">like how you learned all this stuff yeah</span> <span data-start="986.95" data-end="989.23">yeah so actually a fun in fact I'm glad</span> <span data-start="989.23" data-end="990.459">we get to talk about this this is much</span> <span data-start="990.459" data-end="993.25">better than whatever I just did I have</span> <span data-start="993.25" data-end="995.44">an art degree I totally self-taught I</span> <span data-start="995.44" data-end="997.06">went to her school highly recommend it</span> <span data-start="997.06" data-end="999.82">wonderful program but for some reason</span> <span data-start="999.82" data-end="1002.579">like even like through my like school</span> <span data-start="1002.579" data-end="1003.87">like through high school of that like I</span> <span data-start="1003.87" data-end="1005.579">kind of have to completely immerse</span> <span data-start="1005.579"

data-end="1009.63">until I know every small detail about</span> <span data-start="1009.63" data-end="1010.26">every little thing</span> <span data-start="1010.26" data-end="1012.63">so I just like
