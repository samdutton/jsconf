data-end="1453.51">want to look at real time because</span> <span data-start="1453.51" data-end="1455.37">everybody wants to be real time these</span> <span data-start="1455.37" data-end="1456.81">days and in fact I was I was laughing</span> <span data-start="1456.81" data-end="1459.99">because I noticed that the the go-to app</span> <span data-start="1459.99" data-end="1462.96">which was like the the to-do app that</span> <span data-start="1462.96" data-end="1464.61">people were using as a tutorial for</span> <span data-start="1464.61" data-end="1466.47">their framework has now switched to the</span> <span data-start="1466.47" data-end="1470.22">real-time chat tutorial right so all</span> <span data-start="1470.22" data-end="1470.97">these frameworks have chatted</span> <span data-start="1470.97" data-end="1472.35">differentiates themselves by having you</span> <span data-start="1472.35" data-end="1473.34">build something in real time because</span> <span data-start="1473.34" data-end="1474.75">they know that's what people are looking</span> <span data-start="1474.75" data-end="1477.539">at right but when I looked around at</span> <span data-start="1477.539" data-end="1479.64">this pattern I was surprised to find a</span> <span data-start="1479.64" data-end="1481.02">little bit more consistency than I was</span> <span data-start="1481.02" data-end="1483.36">expecting for something that I thought</span> <span data-start="1483.36" data-end="1488.309">was just an emerging pattern the way</span> <span data-start="1488.309" data-end="1490.14">that people are integrating it actually</span> <span data-start="1490.14" data-end="1492.659">seems very similar to me but as a</span> <span data-start="1492.659" data-end="1493.95">pattern now so it felt like there was</span> <span data-start="1493.95" data-end="1494.909">something missing so if you look at</span> <span data-start="1494.909" data-end="1497.309">these bullet points obviously you can</span> <span data-start="1497.309" data-end="1498.809">subscribe to real-time updates from the</span> <span data-start="1498.809" data-end="1502.44">server but the the thing that I think</span> <span data-start="1502.44" data-end="1503.669">makes this the pattern the thing that I</span> <span data-start="1503.669" data-end="1505.77">think is really useful here is the idea</span> <span data-start="1505.77" data-end="1508.32">that those real-time updates get</span> <span data-start="1508.32" data-end="1509.789">dispatched through your normal model</span> <span data-start="1509.789" data-end="1511.71">layer in a way that's very familiar to</span> <span data-start="1511.71" data-end="1512.909">you and they you don't have to spend a</span> <span data-start="1512.909" data-end="1515.039">lot of time reasoning about real-time as</span> <span data-start="1515.039" data-end="1518.039">separate from not real-time right we'll</span> <span data-start="1518.039" data-end="1519.059">kind of see what that looks like you can</span> <span data-start="1519.059" data-end="1521.64">you can register for four events just</span> <span data-start="1521.64" data-end="1525.299">like normal models so I looked at</span> <span data-start="1525.299" data-end="1528.48">angular first I didn't I didn't write</span> <span data-start="1528.48" data-end="1530.34">these examples I kind of googled around</span> <span data-start="1530.34" data-end="1531.48">and looking for what people were doing</span> <span data-start="1531.48" data-end="1533.549">with real-time and angular and I found</span> <span data-start="1533.549" data-end="1536.49">this so this is kind of an example of</span> <span data-start="1536.49" data-end="1538.38">how you might kind of build a blog that</span> <span data-start="1538.38" data-end="1540.24">gets real-time updates or whatever right</span> <span data-start="1540.24" data-end="1542.82">and so you're kind of going into your</span> <span data-start="1542.82" data-end="1544.169">angular controller you've got your scope</span> <span data-start="1544.169" data-end="1546.299">there and you give it an empty list of</span> <span data-start="1546.299" data-end="1547.86">items that you're gonna presumably fill</span> <span data-start="1547.86" data-end="1551.07">and you have this this initial method to</span> <span data-start="1551.07" data-end="1553.35">retrieve your initial data right so just</span> <span data-start="1553.35" data-end="1555.87">do a regular HS call get your items back</span> <span data-start="1555.87" data-end="1557.789">and shove them on that scope and you're</span> <span data-start="1557.789" data-end="1560.58">good to get started right but then to</span> <span data-start="1560.58" data-end="1561.96">add the real-time component they pulled</span> <span data-start="1561.96" data-end="1563.4">in this service angular wants you to go</span> <span data-start="1563.4" data-end="1564.72">through these services to access data</span> <span data-start="1564.72" data-end="1568.409">and so they've got this this pusher this</span> <span data-start="1568.409" data-end="1570.809">pusher service that exposes this</span> <span data-start="1570.809" data-end="1572.52">subscribe method and instead subscribe</span> <span data-start="1572.52" data-end="1574.83">to you know whatever whatever collection</span> <span data-start="1574.83" data-end="1576.419">on the server will give you real-time</span> <span data-start="1576.419" data-end="1578.88">updates in this case just called items</span> <span data-start="1578.88" data-end="1581.159">and register a callback and every time</span> <span data-start="1581.159" data-end="1583.26">there's a real-time update of items</span> <span data-start="1583.26" data-end="1585.48">we're gonna fire this thing and all I'm</span> <span data-start="1585.48" data-end="1587.07">doing dealing here is pushing it onto</span> <span data-start="1587.07" data-end="1589.53">this this items alright and if you</span> <span data-start="1589.53" data-end="1591.21">remember this is this is there's not</span> <span data-start="1591.21" data-end="1593.7">much else here because angular is</span> <span data-start="1593.7" data-end="1595.83">listening for changes to this scope so</span> <span data-start="1595.83" data-end="1596.94">all I have to do is push these items</span> <span data-start="1596.94" data-end="1598.32">here and all the stuff that's listening</span> <span data-start="1598.32" data-end="1599.52">for changes is going to</span> <span data-start="1599.52" data-end="1601.08">and in this case they're gonna update in</span> <span data-start="1601.08" data-end="1603.09">real time and sometimes that's really</span> <span data-start="1603.09" data-end="1604.86">all you need right like that's really</span> <span data-start="1604.86" data-end="1606.33">all you want is to say for this</span> <span data-start="1606.33" data-end="1608.309">particular list I want it to update as</span> <span data-start="1608.309" data-end="1610.23">soon as these objects come in so as fast</span> <span data-start="1610.23" data-end="1612.75">as possible and that that's all it takes</span> <span data-start="1612.75" data-end="1614.79">in this case and I think that's pretty</span> <span data-start="1614.79" data-end="1616.679">nice it's very explicit which is which</span> <span data-start="1616.679" data-end="1619.41">is cool but it's also kind of you know</span> <span data-start="1619.41" data-end="1621.03">like it could be better it could be</span> <span data-start="1621.03" data-end="1622.8">encapsulated a little bit better I don't</span> <span data-start="1622.8" data-end="1624.63">have to always worry about you know</span> <span data-start="1624.63" data-end="1626.55">setting up this subscribe and every</span> <span data-start="1626.55" data-end="1627.929">controller that I need this just real</span> <span data-start="1627.929" data-end="1630.45">time stuff right so I jumped over to</span> <span data-start="1630.45" data-end="1632.91">ember googled around a little bit and I</span> <span data-start="1632.91" data-end="1634.92">found something extremely similar right</span> <span data-start="1634.92" data-end="1636.72">completely unrelated but extremely</span> <span data-start="1636.72" data-end="1639.27">similar this is from the discourse folks</span> <span data-start="1639.27" data-end="1643.32">who are heavy ember users and they're</span> <span data-start="1643.32" data-end="1644.64">doing a similar thing building a blog</span> <span data-start="1644.64" data-end="1647.1">wanted to be real-time updates such and</span> <span data-start="1647.1" data-end="1649.23">such and they do kind of the same thing</span> <span data-start="1649.23" data-end="1650.13">right so you're there in their</span> <span data-start="1650.13" data-end="1652.26">controller create this subscribe method</span> <span data-start="1652.26" data-end="1653.07">that's going to give them real-time</span> <span data-start="1653.07" data-end="1656.46">capabilities and they're using this this</span> <span data-start="1656.46" data-end="1659.58">library called a message bus which you</span> <span data-start="1659.58" data-end="1661.5">know if I'm not mistaken is a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1661.5" data-end="1662.88">client that kind of connects to this</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1662.88" data-end="1664.679">Ruby back-end that gives you real-time</span> <span data-start="1664.679" data-end="1667.41">updates and it just just exposes this</span> <span data-start="1667.41" data-end="1668.88">subscribe method and it says subscribe</span> <span data-start="1668.88" data-end="1670.86">to whatever thing on your back-end you</span> <span data-start="1670.86" data-end="1673.62">want to get real-time from you you know</span> <span data-start="1673.62" data-end="1675.51">you register a callback and where's</span> <span data-start="1675.51" data-end="1677.25">gonna give you data and then you take</span> <span data-start="1677.25" data-end="1679.5">that data and you you shove it into the</span> <span data-start="1679.5" data-end="1681.42">the part of the model layer that you</span> <span data-start="1681.42" data-end="1683.82">want to fire of its fire update events</span> <span data-start="1683.82" data-end="1686.01">and in the case of ember kind of looks</span> <span data-start="1686.01" data-end="1690.12">like this the the controller model stuff</span> <span data-start="1690.12" data-end="1692.01">and ember is still a little sketchy to</span> <span data-start="1692.01" data-end="1693.72">me but like you don't need a lot to</span> <span data-start="1693.72" data-end="1695.13">understand this when you get some data</span> <span data-start="1695.13" data-end="1696.6">here's where you put it it's gonna</span> <span data-start="1696.6" data-end="1698.76">update in real time no fuss no muss</span> <span data-start="1698.76" data-end="1701.19">right I put citations for these these</span> <span data-start="1701.19" data-end="1703.2">two that aren't mine so you can go and</span> <span data-start="1703.2" data-end="1705.03">check them out so I was surprised that</span> <span data-start="1705.03" data-end="1706.59">these things looked look pretty similar</span> <span data-start="1706.59" data-end="1707.52">but you know they're still pretty</span> <span data-start="1707.52" data-end="1709.2">explicit they're still not encapsulated</span> <span data-start="1709.2" data-end="1712.41">well and so this I think is an</span> <span data-start="1712.41" data-end="1714.69">interesting place to look at em juiced</span> <span data-start="1714.69" data-end="1716.97">again we didn't talk about how ya induce</span> <span data-start="1716.97" data-end="1718.59">models are created but it count looks</span> <span data-start="1718.59" data-end="1720.63">like this you just define a new model in</span> <span data-start="1720.63" data-end="1722.19">this case we're making a feed which is</span> <span data-start="1722.19" data-end="1724.62">you know kind of that list of threaded</span> <span data-start="1724.62" data-end="1726.54">conversations and we're associating it</span> <span data-start="1726.54" data-end="1728.6">with a real-time feed client</span> <span data-start="1728.6" data-end="1730.65">appropriately named this is gonna say</span> <span data-start="1730.65" data-end="1732.33">this is gonna get real-time data for you</span> <span data-start="1732.33" data-end="1732.87">and</span> <span data-start="1732.87" data-end="1735.75">surface it in a way that you can use and</span> <span data-start="1735.75" data-end="1737.67">in a completely different file this is a</span> <span data-start="1737.67" data-end="1739.59">pretty sophisticated system which means</span> <span data-start="1739.59" data-end="1741.69">that it's a it's kind of overgrown and</span> <span data-start="1741.69" data-end="1743.34">hard to maintain and a completely</span> <span data-start="1743.34" data-end="1745.17">different file you have your base real</span> <span

data-start="1752.52" data-end="1754.5">the point yet cuz stuff is the same so</span> <span data-start="1754.5" data-end="1756.3">here's your subscribe you give it an ID</span> <span

data-end="1762.51">surface that data right that's what this</span> <span data-start="1762.51" data-end="1763.95">is where the difference comes in and</span> <span data-start="1763.95" data-end="1766.2">this is where this pattern is a little</span> <span data-start="1766.2" data-end="1767.309">more complete than the ones that we just</span> <span data-start="1767.309" data-end="1769.17">looked at because this is buried right</span> <span data-start="1769.17" data-end="1771.51">this is an abstraction that's wrapped in</span> <span data-start="1771.51" data-end="1773.55">our model layer so the usage looks</span> <span data-start="1773.55" data-end="1775.47">different the user just looks like this</span> <span data-start="1775.47" data-end="1778.14">you just create your your model like you</span> <span data-start="1778.14" data-end="1780.48">like you do in any other place and then</span> <span data-start="1780.48" data-end="1782.22">you hook on to this on thread update</span> <span data-start="1782.22" data-end="1783.929">that says if there's if there are new</span> <span data-start="1783.929" data-end="1785.7">threads coming into this this feed</span> <span data-start="1785.7" data-end="1788.22">collection let me know and that's it</span> <span data-start="1788.22" data-end="1789.87">like you don't have to mess around with</span> <span data-start="1789.87" data-end="1791.34">the real-time this could be a regular</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1791.34" data-end="1792.78">Ajax call this could be real-time we</span> <span data-start="1792.78" data-end="1794.88">don't really care all of our our UI is</span> <span

data-end="1812.4">this stuff has to change right that's</span> <span data-start="1812.4" data-end="1813.99">that that's ideally what you want from a</span> <span data-start="1813.99" data-end="1815.059">pattern is something that's actually</span> <span data-start="1815.059" data-end="1817.86">modular and encapsulated like this</span> <span data-start="1817.86" data-end="1822.48">so I hesitated to put this this light</span> <span data-start="1822.48" data-end="1824.52">these last slides in because I've been</span> <span data-start="1824.52" data-end="1826.38">doing these investigations of these</span> <span data-start="1826.38" data-end="1829.02">frameworks but I wanted to look at</span> <span data-start="1829.02" data-end="1831.75">meteora but I didn't I didn't get very</span> <span data-start="1831.75" data-end="1835.11">far because I think something about</span> <span data-start="1835.11" data-end="1836.82">media or kind of twist my brain in a way</span> <span data-start="1836.82" data-end="1841.62">that is not very cool so I only got so</span> <span data-start="1841.62" data-end="1844.71">far with this but I did I did recognize</span> <span data-start="1844.71" data-end="1847.38">that media or I think is establishing</span> <span data-start="1847.38" data-end="1850.32">this real-time pattern in a way that I</span> <span data-start="1850.32" data-end="1852.36">think makes a lot more sense right so</span> <span data-start="1852.36" data-end="1854.7">this is the meteor example in that you</span> <span data-start="1854.7" data-end="1856.71">just create you know this this meteor</span> <span data-start="1856.71" data-end="1858.9">collection of messages right you do a</span> <span data-start="1858.9" data-end="1860.49">query on it by saying find and it's</span> <span data-start="1860.49"

data-end="1886.929">like a normal message collection that</span> <span data-start="1886.929" data-end="1889.809">you can then send into templates right</span> <span data-start="1889.809" data-end="1891.789">and instead of just you know you loop</span> <span data-start="1891.789" data-end="1893.11">over the messages that are there if you</span> <span data-start="1893.11" data-end="1894.19">look at you know this is our message</span> <span data-start="1894.19" data-end="1895.84">list you loop over the messages that are</span> <span data-start="1895.84" data-end="1897.22">there they're gonna get rendered but</span> <span data-start="1897.22" data-end="1899.429">also any any messages that get synced</span> <span data-start="1899.429" data-end="1901.45">subsequently from the server they're</span> <span data-start="1901.45" data-end="1902.769">gonna get rendered like this is all kind</span> <span data-start="1902.769" data-end="1905.44">of hooked up in a nice way in a kind of</span> <span data-start="1905.44" data-end="1907.029">magical way but it's also kind of nice</span> <span data-start="1907.029" data-end="1910.33">right and this is what I think we want</span> <span data-start="1910.33" data-end="1912.01">the the real-time connection to be is</span> <span data-start="1912.01" data-end="1913.6">the thing where we go through our models</span> <span data-start="1913.6" data-end="1915.1">we use this pattern that we already know</span> <span data-start="1915.1" data-end="1916.99">the basic one that everybody in here</span> <span data-start="1916.99" data-end="1918.13">said yeah our you know how to do that</span> <span data-start="1918.13" data-end="1920.47">but you get real-time with the same</span> <span data-start="1920.47" data-end="1925.12">capabilities right so I hope I've kind</span> <span data-start="1925.12" data-end="1928.059">of Illustrated how these patterns have</span> <span data-start="1928.059" data-end="1929.679">kind of helped me evaluate these</span> <span data-start="1929.679" data-end="1931.21">different frameworks and I want to wrap</span> <span data-start="1931.21" data-end="1934.539">up here but I like this quote this is</span> <span data-start="1934.539" data-end="1937.6">from our VP of engineering and when he</span> <span data-start="1937.6" data-end="1939.19">said this I knew that he had captured</span> <span data-start="1939.19" data-end="1941.59">the the the core of why I felt like this</span> <span data-start="1941.59" data-end="1943.779">would be a good talk because rather than</span> <span data-start="1943.779" data-end="1945.549">kind of being inundated by all these</span> <span data-start="1945.549" data-end="1948.1">solutions that we have to evaluate it's</span> <span data-start="1948.1" data-end="1949.33">much better to kind of get really</span> <span data-start="1949.33" data-end="1951.49">acquainted with the problem right the</span> <span data-start="1951.49" data-end="1953.08">thing that we're trying to do and how we</span> <span data-start="1953.08" data-end="1955.21">expect to be able to do it and evaluate</span> <span data-start="1955.21" data-end="1956.769">these frameworks against that right</span> <span data-start="1956.769" data-end="1959.44">rather than kind of saying how do I do</span> <span data-start="1959.44" data-end="1961.96">this an ember how do I do this thing and</span> <span data-start="1961.96" data-end="1964.99">angular my question becomes I know I can</span> <span data-start="1964.99" data-end="1965.95">do this thing right</span> <span data-start="1965.95" data-end="1968.08">like I want angular to enable me to do</span> <span data-start="1968.08" data-end="1969.49">this thing so I know what I'm looking</span> <span data-start="1969.49" data-end="1971.559">for right I'm looking for my models I'm</span> <span data-start="1971.559" data-end="1973.659">looking for how I can inspect them I'm</span> <span data-start="1973.659" data-end="1976.419">looking for how I can register callbacks</span> <span data-start="1976.419" data-end="1978.399">and I'm looking for how I can nest views</span> <span data-start="1978.399" data-end="1981.159">and I know what to expect right that's</span> <span data-start="1981.159" data-end="1983.47">been a huge win for me in terms of doing</span> <span data-start="1983.47" data-end="1987.22">these evaluations right and so what I</span> <span data-start="1987.22" data-end="1988.48">want to leave you with is like let's</span> <span data-start="1988.48" data-end="1990.49">find a way to talk more about these</span> <span data-start="1990.49" data-end="1992.679">shared patterns let's let's get these</span> <span data-start="1992.679" data-end="1994.899">examples let's like use github let's get</span> <span data-start="1994.899" data-end="1997.51">people to contribute let's find out how</span> <span data-start="1997.51" data-end="1998.8">far these patterns are</span> <span data-start="1998.8" data-end="2001.35">reading across our community and used</span> <span data-start="2001.35" data-end="2003.09">them as a context for for having a</span> <span data-start="2003.09" data-end="2005.18">stronger basis for front-end development</span> <span data-start="2005.18" data-end="2007.74">and that's basically it</span> </p>
