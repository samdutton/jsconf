same time there's a really there's a</span> <span data-start="112.64" data-end="113.84">lot of fiddly bits when it comes to</span> <span data-start="113.84" data-end="115.52">writing a code editor that's good and</span> <span data-start="115.52" data-end="118.4">usable and when you're building a web</span> <span data-start="118.4" data-end="121.19">based editor you have the web based the</span> <span data-start="121.19" data-end="123.11">fiddly bits right i mean we don't know</span> <span data-start="123.11" data-end="124.909">about those and you have the fiddly bits</span> <span data-start="124.909" data-end="127.22">of getting code editing right so one of</span> <span data-start="127.22" data-end="129.259">the things that we wanted actually from</span> <span data-start="129.259" data-end="131.75">the beginning of best bin on forward is</span> <span data-start="131.75" data-end="133.19">basically no compromises that we want</span> <span data-start="133.19" data-end="135.2">this to be an editor that competes at</span> <span data-start="135.2" data-end="136.909">the same level as desktop editors it</span> <span data-start="136.909" data-end="138.53">shouldn't have any you shouldn't feel</span> <span data-start="138.53" data-end="140.9">like oh man I'm really giving this up to</span> <span data-start="140.9" data-end="142.849">go work on this to use this editor it</span> <span data-start="142.849" data-end="145.22">should be the one you want to use so</span> <span data-start="145.22" data-end="148.34">that's what we strive for so basically</span> <span data-start="148.34" data-end="150.23">the ACE editor that's what it stands for</span> <span data-start="150.23" data-end="152.15">up their age I stood or cloud nine</span> <span data-start="152.15" data-end="153.489">editor but ace is a lot easier to say</span> <span data-start="153.489" data-end="156.439">it's fully featured so that means it</span> <span data-start="156.439" data-end="157.879">really has a lot of the stuff that</span> <span data-start="157.879" data-end="159.2">you're familiar with and comfortable</span> <span data-start="159.2" data-end="160.76">with and you'll see some of these</span> <span data-start="160.76" data-end="162.319">features in action as we go along here</span> <span data-start="162.319" data-end="164.029">it's extensible so you can write your</span> <span data-start="164.029" data-end="165.53">own syntax highlighters you can</span> <span data-start="165.53" data-end="167.569">aight themes you can write new commands</span> <span data-start="167.569" data-end="169.43">for the editor change the keyboard</span> <span data-start="169.43" data-end="171.29">bindings do all kinds of other things to</span> <span data-start="171.29" data-end="173.66">it so it's extensible it's scalable so</span> <span data-start="173.66" data-end="175.7">if you have multi tens of thousands of</span> <span data-start="175.7" data-end="177.59">lines of code in a file you should</span> <span data-start="177.59" data-end="178.91">probably make the break that file up but</span> <span data-start="178.91" data-end="181.58">if you do you can you can load it in</span> <span data-start="181.58" data-end="182.68">this editor and it's not going to crash</span> <span data-start="182.68" data-end="185.75">and cross-browser going back to ie7 so</span> <span data-start="185.75" data-end="187.7">this is basically code you can run</span> <span data-start="187.7" data-end="189.17">anywhere and that's one difference</span> <span data-start="189.17" data-end="191.27">between ace and Bespin was best been</span> <span data-start="191.27" data-end="192.739">used canvas so it didn't run out of</span> <span data-start="192.739" data-end="194.72">older browsers ace doesn't have that</span> <span data-start="194.72" data-end="197.959">particular constraint so I'll hand it</span> <span data-start="197.959" data-end="201.62">over to Fabian to do a demo ok yeah I'll</span> <span data-start="201.62" data-end="204.709">do a small demo today the goal is to</span> <span data-start="204.709" data-end="206.81">have like a small CoffeeScript</span> <span data-start="206.81" data-end="209.18">prevarication like a seat here we're</span> <span data-start="209.18" data-end="211.85">going to

data-start="1532.88" data-end="1534.2">was a command line that was one of the</span> <span data-start="1534.2" data-end="1536.24">somewhat unique features there's a</span> <span data-start="1536.24" data-end="1537.71">command line because editors often grow</span> <span data-start="1537.71" data-end="1539.96">a lot of features and so that command</span> <span data-start="1539.96" data-end="1541.309">line is still available if you want to</span> <span data-start="1541.309" data-end="1543.89">use it and basically in this case we're</span> <span data-start="1543.89" data-end="1545.179">taking the replace all command you can</span> <span data-start="1545.179" data-end="1547.34">see that not only does this command line</span> <span data-start="1547.34"

data-end="1584.44">playing again oh I want okay</span> <span data-start="1584.45" data-end="1586.35">well anyway what I was saying about the</span> <span data-start="1586.35" data-end="1589.47">command line it was that the really cool</span> <span data-start="1589.47" data-end="1590.73">thing about that is that you could have</span> <span data-start="1590.73" data-end="1593.159">you could basically have a pop-up of</span> <span data-start="1593.159" data-end="1594.57">that gooey window that had to replace</span> <span data-start="1594.57"

data-end="1599.789">course the command line is great because</span> <span data-start="1599.789" data-end="1601.86">if you have a command line that</span> <span data-start="1601.86" data-end="1603.779">basically means that people can run any</span> <span data-start="1603.779" data-end="1605.82">command I'm using keyboard access and</span> <span data-start="1605.82"

data-end="1610.139">that so that's that's a pretty cool</span> <span data-start="1610.139" data-end="1612.57">feature and you can use it you know if</span> <span data-start="1612.57" data-end="1613.95">you're not actually it's an optional</span> <span data-start="1613.95" data-end="1617.129">module and you can see that you know</span> <span data-start="1617.129" data-end="1618.419">running replace all doesn't back to</span> <span data-start="1618.419" data-end="1620.49">replace all and really pretty much all</span> <span data-start="1620.49" data-end="1622.019">the editor commands everything you do in</span> <span data-start="1622.019" data-end="1623.82">the editor is this sort of command you</span> <span data-start="1623.82" data-end="1626.179">can that you can actually use this way</span> <span data-start="1626.179" data-end="1628.889">another feature i want to show off is</span> <span data-start="1628.889" data-end="1630.48">something that a long time best Minh</span> <span data-start="1630.48" data-end="1632.82">contributor just contributed it's</span> <span data-start="1632.82" data-end="1636.289">basically code folding Julian furyk</span> <span data-start="1636.289" data-end="1638.309">coded this up in just a few days it's</span> <span data-start="1638.309" data-end="1640.23">pretty amazing now the way that code</span> <span data-start="1640.23" data-end="1642.119">folding is implemented right now is</span> <span data-start="1642.119" data-end="1643.98">unstructured code folding or what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1643.98" data-end="1646.529">Wikipedia calls user folding where</span> <span data-start="1646.529" data-end="1648.24">basically you can select any arbitrary</span> <span data-start="1648.24" data-end="1650.61">range of text and say fold this and it</span> <span data-start="1650.61" data-end="1652.769">does it drink sit down so it means you</span> <span data-start="1652.769" data-end="1654.029">can shrink down argument lists if you</span> <span data-start="1654.029" data-end="1655.98">want you could shrink down blocks of</span> <span data-start="1655.98" data-end="1658.139">code the great thing about this</span> <span data-start="1658.139" data-end="1659.94">implementation is that that means you</span> <span data-start="1659.94" data-end="1661.049">know we're probably most people probably</span> <span data-start="1661.049" data-end="1662.999">used to structured code folding where</span> <span data-start="1662.999" data-end="1664.11">it's based on your program structure</span> <span data-start="1664.11" data-end="1666.299">it's very easy to implement structured</span> <span data-start="1666.299" data-end="1667.919">folding on top of this kind of folding</span> <span data-start="1667.919" data-end="1669.48">it'd be hard to go the other way around</span> <span data-start="1669.48" data-end="1672.419">so so that's a pretty cool feature that</span> <span data-start="1672.419" data-end="1674.159">that just recently landed in the tree</span> <span data-start="1674.159" data-end="1677.07">yeah this week actually yeah just a few</span> <span data-start="1677.07" data-end="1680.279">days ago and the last thing I wanna show</span> <span data-start="1680.279" data-end="1684.149">is basically a Firefox plug-in made by</span> <span data-start="1684.149" data-end="1687.779">goes on github basically it has VI key</span> <span data-start="1687.779" data-end="1690.99">bindings because he really likes VI so</span> <span data-start="1690.99" data-end="1692.759">that's one of the unique features about</span> <span data-start="1692.759" data-end="1694.619">aces that you can you can do VI or emacs</span> <span data-start="1694.619" data-end="1697.409">tile key bindings if you like and that's</span> <span data-start="1697.409" data-end="1698.58">the way this one works you can see I'm</span> <span data-start="1698.58" data-end="1700.59">pressing like a scape kkkk to move up</span> <span data-start="1700.59" data-end="1703.169">and odo open the line so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="1703.169" data-end="1705.149">cool but the interesting thing also</span> <span data-start="1705.149" data-end="1706.619">about this is that he made it this is</span> <span data-start="1706.619" data-end="1709.08">actually a Firefox add-on so if you put</span> <span data-start="1709.08"
