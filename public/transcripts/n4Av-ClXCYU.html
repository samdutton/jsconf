on my team built this one and it was</span> <span data-start="169.57" data-end="171.28">pretty basic like as you can see you</span> <span data-start="171.28" data-end="173.55">have like some layers at the bottom and</span> <span data-start="173.55" data-end="176.17">it was this was pretty much determine</span> <span data-start="176.17" data-end="177.91">and every point was kind of to set up</span> <span data-start="177.91" data-end="179.43">some effects some thoughts into that</span> <span data-start="179.43" data-end="184.93">effect and then we had this was another</span> <span data-start="184.93" data-end="188.4">example of a timeline oh my god narrator</span> <span data-start="188.4" data-end="190.9">this one has a little bit it was a</span> <span data-start="190.9" data-end="194.77">little bit more advanced like it had is</span> <span data-start="194.77" data-end="199.72">a curve to you so it had the same I also</span> <span data-start="199.72" data-end="201.13">had like a timeline bill that you had</span> <span data-start="201.13" data-end="202.63">all the blocks like it and usually like</span> <span data-start="202.63" data-end="205.15">in

able to do some</span> <span data-start="211.36" data-end="213.34">curves that it will like you have like a</span> <span data-start="213.34" data-end="215.26">fade effect that you have like a like a</span> <span data-start="215.26" data-end="216.55">camera that goes when teased you will be</span> <span data-start="216.55" data-end="218.11">able to modify that apply that curve to</span> <span data-start="218.11" data-end="222.49">any value from that 3d scene and this</span> <span data-start="222.49" data-end="225.94">one was the last one that we used it was</span> <span data-start="225.94" data-end="227.5">everything everyone each one was done</span> <span data-start="227.5" data-end="228.91">with a different guy and somehow I was</span> <span data-start="228.91" data-end="231.64">working with those guys and I â€” we used</span> <span data-start="231.64" data-end="234.13">those tools the good thing or these this</span> <span data-start="234.13" data-end="235.36">one was also very similar to the</span> <span data-start="235.36" data-end="236.65">previous one like he also had a team</span> <span data-start="236.65" data-end="238.51">like timeline I also had all this like</span> <span data-start="238.51" data-end="243.16">this was like the curve Bo Adam what he</span> <span data-start="243.16" data-end="244.75">was amazing all these is that all those</span> <span data-start="244.75" data-end="246.85">parameters that you will change you will</span> <span data-start="246.85" data-end="249.52">you will see exactly in real time</span> <span data-start="249.52" data-end="251.47">immediately what it will affect like how</span> <span data-start="251.47" data-end="253.84">we look like suddenly I cannot share the</span> <span data-start="253.84" data-end="256.03">tools because they were for Windows and</span> <span data-start="256.03" data-end="258">an item because that was always anymore</span> <span data-start="258" data-end="261.07">but all these we can see there was a</span> <span data-start="261.07" data-end="262.66">screenshot so it will be nice to be able</span> <span data-start="262.66" data-end="264.52">to do a better than more them but I</span> <span data-start="264.52" data-end="265.72">think you can get a little bit of an</span> <span data-start="265.72" data-end="270.03">idea of it so the output of the</span> <span data-start="270.03" data-end="273.58">animations that we did a demo so the</span> <span data-start="273.58" data-end="276.25">problem the output wasn't really amazing</span> <span data-start="276.25" data-end="279.84">because all these was like Howie</span> <span data-start="279.84" data-end="282.03">work like no one was paying for this we</span> <span data-start="282.03" data-end="284.51">will compete with each other and</span> <span data-start="284.51" data-end="289.26">basically we we will work in a new</span> <span data-start="289.26" data-end="291.12">animation or any of them or like a two</span> <span data-start="291.12" data-end="293.46">weeks before the competition so you only</span> <span data-start="293.46" data-end="295.08">had time like like two weeks to build</span> <span data-start="295.08" data-end="297.87">something the developer do so will like</span> <span data-start="297.87" data-end="299.31">over the year will be like working on</span> <span data-start="299.31" data-end="300.86">his free time like building these tools</span> <span data-start="300.86" data-end="303.45">but the output it was always you always</span> <span data-start="303.45" data-end="305.73">had to say like but it was done in two</span> <span data-start="305.73" data-end="307.5">weeks you know don't judge it that way</span> <span data-start="307.5" data-end="308.97">like it's not like after effects</span> <span data-start="308.97" data-end="312.66">animation which that's kind of the</span> <span data-start="312.66" data-end="315.24">reasoning of all this stuff like I saw</span> <span data-start="315.24" data-end="317.31">that it was a lot of potential on this</span> <span data-start="317.31" data-end="319.5">like it was the whole real-time and</span> <span data-start="319.5" data-end="323.52">everything was amazing and I always so I</span> <span data-start="323.52" data-end="326.22">always was very impressed with it means</span> <span data-start="326.22" data-end="327.51">that After Effects didn't have like</span> <span data-start="327.51" data-end="329.51">things like that or like any other like</span> <span data-start="329.51" data-end="332.13">famous editing tool like it was in real</span> <span data-start="332.13" data-end="335.13">time so it's an example show like this</span> <span data-start="335.13" data-end="523.54">one that we're seeing here I again like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="523.55" data-end="525.45">Thanks</span> <span data-start="525.45" data-end="530.91">so so these these demo for this one I</span> <span data-start="530.91" data-end="532.56">was doing all the modeling on 3d studio</span> <span data-start="532.56" data-end="536.79">max we had some exporters also we will</span> <span data-start="536.79" data-end="539.22">build our own exporters so we will</span> <span data-start="539.22" data-end="541.23">export from there to our own format and</span> <span data-start="541.23" data-end="542.61">then it will load in this in this tool</span> <span data-start="542.61" data-end="545.39">and then do all the editing and all the</span> <span data-start="545.39" data-end="547.32">movements I don't know maybe the camera</span> <span data-start="547.32" data-end="549.09">movements I think the camera also were</span> <span data-start="549.09" data-end="551.4">done in 3d see the marks but we'll use</span> <span data-start="551.4" data-end="553.83">modify a little bit like how everything</span> <span data-start="553.83" data-end="555.78">is growing and all the processing and</span> <span data-start="555.78" data-end="557.49">things like this so the thing is like</span> <span data-start="557.49" data-end="559.92">all these that which is like the demo</span> <span data-start="559.92" data-end="563.22">tape which is so it can easily be done</span> <span data-start="563.22" data-end="564.84">like with WebGL it's the same thing like</span> <span data-start="564.84" data-end="567.39">we just happen to be using like DirectX</span> <span data-start="567.39" data-end="570.6">back then but that could be like easily</span> <span data-start="570.6" data-end="574.56">done in WebGL and I'm I wish like the</span> <span data-start="574.56" data-end="576.15">web's were a little bit more like like</span> <span data-start="576.15" data-end="579.51">this these kind of graphics and the</span> <span data-start="579.51" data-end="581.67">pollen was the Ptolemies that we still</span> <span data-start="581.67" data-end="583.5">needs better tools to build this kind of</span> <span data-start="583.5" data-end="585.56">thing right now is everything is for</span> <span data-start="585.56" data-end="587.88">developers so far like we need more like</span> <span data-start="587.88" data-end="589.2">to be able to remove from each of the</span> <span data-start="589.2" data-end="592.44">people doing graphics and 3d stuff so</span> <span data-start="592.44" data-end="594">exactly one year ago comes eventually</span> <span data-start="594" data-end="597.89">one year ago I was invited to touch yes</span> <span data-start="597.89" data-end="601.65">and I used that as an excuse to start</span> <span data-start="601.65" data-end="603.51">building like a library like it's a</span> <span data-start="603.51" data-end="605.31">building this tool like I wanted to</span> <span data-start="605.31" data-end="606.99">recreate a tool that I just show like</span> <span data-start="606.99" data-end="608.76">this is this previous one I wanted to</span> <span data-start="608.76" data-end="611.37">recreate this one I wanted to have it</span> <span data-start="611.37" data-end="614.43">again back but so I thought like what</span> <span data-start="614.43" data-end="615.69">about trying to build is like in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="615.69" data-end="618.06">JavaScript and make it open and making</span> <span data-start="618.06" data-end="619.41">like a Bella before everyone and see</span> <span data-start="619.41" data-end="622.05">what happens when a tool like this is</span> <span data-start="622.05" data-end="623.73">available for like people and people can</span> <span data-start="623.73"

little bit</span> <span data-start="628.569" data-end="630.16">like flash was like an open-source flash</span> <span data-start="630.16" data-end="634.66">in a way so I built like a very like I</span> <span data-start="634.66" data-end="635.619">quickly built like I think it was</span> <span data-start="635.619" data-end="637.66">probably like two weeks or something</span> <span data-start="637.66" data-end="640.24">also which is how to build like a</span> <span data-start="640.24" data-end="643.769">prototype of like a first version of it</span> <span data-start="643.769" data-end="646.029">this is not a seven how it look like a</span> <span data-start="646.029" data-end="647.47">looked at how many wars on this but I</span> <span data-start="647.47" data-end="713.759">think it idea</span> <span data-start="713.769" data-end="716.99">so this is this is using this was done</span> <span data-start="716.99" data-end="718.879">thank you</span> <span data-start="718.879" data-end="722.329">this was done using this shader effect</span> <span data-start="722.329" data-end="723.74">like fragment shaders that you can find</span> <span

data-end="732.199">think well I I give some credit here for</span> <span data-start="732.199" data-end="734.18">the reasons that I took but I had to</span> <span data-start="734.18" data-end="737.18">build something very quickly so in this</span> <span data-start="737.18" data-end="739.339">case and I just built like some basic</span> <span data-start="739.339" data-end="741.29">modules or you will pass any fragment</span> <span data-start="741.29" data-end="743.24">shader and then a time or like some</span> <span data-start="743.24" data-end="745.819">properties to it and then do like a play</span> <span data-start="745.819" data-end="750.079">them just in the right time so this at</span> <span data-start="750.079" data-end="751.399">this form that this soul was not very</span> <span data-start="751.399" data-end="754.129">useful like it can only you know show</span> <span data-start="754.129"

data-end="763.67">that's the way he only things they can</span> <span data-start="763.67" data-end="766.879">use like move the flash maybe this was</span> <span data-start="766.879" data-end="768.29">just a simple module that it will just</span> <span data-start="768.29" data-end="770.269">like to draw a quad on top of it with</span> <span data-start="770.269"

data-end="825.129">katana computers and in this one they do</span> <span data-start="825.129" data-end="830.66">some demo swing competitions so I wanted</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="830.66" data-end="833.66">I thought going back to this one and see</span> <span data-start="833.66" data-end="837.25">if I correlate something</span> <span data-start="837.26" data-end="840.17">and I send myself the challenge of like</span> <span data-start="840.17" data-end="842.27">he is going with the Chromebook like</span> <span data-start="842.27" data-end="846.71">these $3 crumbled and see was I what I</span> <span data-start="846.71" data-end="848.96">could do with it like I kind of found it</span> <span data-start="848.96" data-end="851.12">interesting that this device this</span> <span data-start="851.12" data-end="853.37">machine had the same power that they the</span> <span data-start="853.37" data-end="854.99">computer that I was powering ten years</span> <span data-start="854.99" data-end="857.14">ago with the screen on there on the</span> <span data-start="857.14" data-end="859.58">compute on the big tower on the back and</span> <span data-start="859.58" data-end="861.29">now I could just carry over this is</span> <span data-start="861.29" data-end="862.76">super super to device and see what I can</span> <span data-start="862.76" data-end="864.44">do with this with this thing so I lock</span> <span data-start="864.44" data-end="866.96">myself in the room for like two days</span> <span data-start="866.96" data-end="870.11">before they contain competition and to</span> <span data-start="870.11" data-end="871.22">see what I called Oh like I only had one</span> <span data-start="871.22" data-end="873.77">song and then I had to build out of it</span> <span data-start="873.77" data-end="875.21">something with it it was a bit</span> <span data-start="875.21" data-end="877.61">challenging because this is running</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="877.61" data-end="879.83">Chrome OS and and whenever you're doing</span> <span data-start="879.83" data-end="882.14">something with crumble any browser you</span> <span data-start="882.14" data-end="884.99">have some security limitations</span> <span data-start="884.99" data-end="886.55">you cannot load textures so you can</span> <span data-start="886.55" data-end="890.54">unload some like even JSON files so I</span> <span data-start="890.54" data-end="893.93">had to basically have to use like lower</span> <span data-start="893.93" data-end="895.34">like three tiers and use all the</span> <span data-start="895.34" data-end="896.9">primitives that they had available and</span> <span data-start="896.9" data-end="899.48">build something out of it so this is</span> <span data-start="899.48" data-end="1151.57">what I built</span> <span data-start="1151.58" data-end="1155.85">Thanks so was it oh wow</span> <span data-start="1155.85" data-end="1157.89">it goes back well as an experiment on</span> <span data-start="1157.89" data-end="1160.29">this one I try adding like as if it was</span> <span data-start="1160.29" data-end="1163.34">a video so you can forward to any point</span> <span data-start="1163.34" data-end="1167.85">in time if it allows me yeah like if it</span> <span data-start="1167.85" data-end="1169.47">was any kind of idiot but the good thing</span> <span data-start="1169.47" data-end="1172.02">then the nice thing of this is that even</span> <span data-start="1172.02" data-end="1173.91">in these it happens that this resolution</span> <span data-start="1173.91" data-end="1175.41">right now is pretty I don't I don't</span> <span data-start="1175.41" data-end="1177.06">think I have done anything at such a</span> <span data-start="1177.06" data-end="1178.77">high resolution so in this case the good</span> <span data-start="1178.77" data-end="1180.9">benefit is that if you had a video it</span> <span data-start="1180.9" data-end="1182.22">will look a little bit blurry but this</span> <span data-start="1182.22" data-end="1184.26">is still as crisp as the projector can</span> <span data-start="1184.26" data-end="1197.28">be so for this I just the same I just</span> <span data-start="1197.28" data-end="1199.98">the same version of the tool or the</span> <span data-start="1199.98" data-end="1201.69">editor that they have from the J's</span> <span data-start="1201.69" data-end="1204.3">basically I just added a few things like</span> <span data-start="1204.3" data-end="1207.3">now I call like zoom in the timeline to</span> <span data-start="1207.3" data-end="1209.07">kind of navigate a little bit quicker</span> <span data-start="1209.07" data-end="1213.81">and maybe a co like resize the effects</span> <span data-start="1213.81" data-end="1216.38">and mobile it a bit but uh but that's</span> <span data-start="1216.38" data-end="1219.54">actually I was also like we able to like</span> <span data-start="1219.54" data-end="1222.41">clone an effect so like if I had this</span> <span data-start="1222.41" data-end="1225">like a I could have another flash there</span> <span data-start="1225" data-end="1227.22">if I wanted to make his move it out</span> <span data-start="1227.22" data-end="1232.59">towards when he goes away like whatever</span> <span data-start="1232.59" data-end="1237.33">and here you can also remove some and in</span> <span data-start="1237.33" data-end="1238.83">this case it was actually useful because</span> <span data-start="1238.83" data-end="1240.93">whatever I was doing here and then I</span> <span data-start="1240.93" data-end="1243.66">call like a sports so this which is</span> <span data-start="1243.66" data-end="1247.95">basically like a kind of format like I</span> <span data-start="1247.95" data-end="1251.28">still try to move define this is a JSON</span> <span data-start="1251.28" data-end="1255.15">format that then I run time whenever you</span> <span data-start="1255.15" data-end="1256.89">using the editor button you can use a</span> <span data-start="1256.89" data-end="1258.6">player and that's this is what the</span> <span data-start="1258.6" data-end="1260.58">player basically needs and also you also</span> <span data-start="1260.58" data-end="1262.61">need like the modules and is like this</span> <span data-start="1262.61" data-end="1265.2">so from here I call like edit the whole</span> <span data-start="1265.2" data-end="1266.79">thing like duplicate things and explore</span> <span data-start="1266.79" data-end="1267.61">it and</span> <span data-start="1267.61" data-end="1270.16">it started to be able to be useful but</span> <span data-start="1270.16" data-end="1272.02">for instance if I wanted more if I</span> <span data-start="1272.02" data-end="1274.78">wanted to modify like any anything in it</span> <span data-start="1274.78" data-end="1278.71">like I still couldn't like change any</span> <span data-start="1278.71" data-end="1281.83">parameters from here so if I one here</span> <span data-start="1281.83" data-end="1285.61">for instance if I wanted this in scene</span> <span data-start="1285.61" data-end="1289.03">from module I had to go back to the code</span> <span data-start="1289.03" data-end="1295.33">which this is how it used to look here</span> <span data-start="1295.33" data-end="1297.1">for instance you want to change instead</span> <span data-start="1297.1" data-end="1299.89">of being the Lighting's of the thing</span> <span data-start="1299.89" data-end="1307.51">with I know what can I change yeah so</span> <span data-start="1307.51" data-end="1309.88">the having this red color like we can</span> <span data-start="1309.88" data-end="1314.23">just change it how to below then kind of</span> <span data-start="1314.23" data-end="1316.51">go back to the same place but now you</span> <span data-start="1316.51" data-end="1318.9">can see that the lights around it is</span> <span data-start="1318.9" data-end="1322.06">yellow and I guess it will be binary</span> <span data-start="1322.06" data-end="1332.62">change also the sphere like this one</span> <span data-start="1332.63" data-end="1334.72">so now I said that having this rather</span> <span data-start="1334.72" data-end="1336.92">sing in the middle like we have it in in</span> <span data-start="1336.92" data-end="1339.59">jello and everything just looks like as</span> <span data-start="1339.59" data-end="1341.87">it used to be but you know and still</span> <span data-start="1341.87" data-end="1344.06">like this is not a very nice process</span> <span data-start="1344.06" data-end="1345.59">like you still need to go back to the</span> <span data-start="1345.59" data-end="1348.35">sublime modify the the effect and</span> <span data-start="1348.35" data-end="1350.15">everything and this is enough this is</span> <span data-start="1350.15" data-end="1351.29">not like it's something that you want to</span> <span data-start="1351.29" data-end="1353.36">have like a graphic like a designer's</span> <span data-start="1353.36" data-end="1359.18">deserve so actually there was something</span> <span data-start="1359.18" data-end="1362.05">interesting for them</span> <span data-start="1362.05" data-end="1364.16">another feature that I had to add for</span> <span data-start="1364.16" data-end="1366.47">this or that they managed were the</span> <span data-start="1366.47" data-end="1369.32">example like for this demo was so we're</span> <span data-start="1369.32" data-end="1373.25">swimming into the timeline we make for</span> <span data-start="1373.25" data-end="1375.77">instance for this part let's put the</span> <span data-start="1375.77" data-end="1394.55">music very well think thinking that can</span> <span data-start="1394.55" data-end="1396.14">be like kind of a pain I having some or</span> <span data-start="1396.14" data-end="1398.72">all those things but you can with the</span> <span data-start="1398.72" data-end="1400.52">audio Pia you can reduce the playback</span> <span data-start="1400.52" data-end="1413.93">rate this is basically how you think you</span> <span data-start="1413.93" data-end="1415.19">keep listening to the whole thing it's a</span> <span data-start="1415.19" data-end="1418.22">very slow favorite rate and in your</span> <span data-start="1418.22" data-end="1420.02">listens it's kind of if the music wasn't</span> <span data-start="1420.02" data-end="1423.71">darker now it is cinema dark today I</span> <span data-start="1423.71" data-end="1426.8">managed to get this thing and it's kind</span> <span data-start="1426.8" data-end="1437.39">of the basic of what I usually need</span> <span data-start="1437.4" data-end="1441.84">so four months later since then I was</span> <span data-start="1441.84" data-end="1443.97">invited here and then I used this as an</span> <span data-start="1443.97" data-end="1445.65">excuse to add like more improvements to</span> <span data-start="1445.65" data-end="1448.77">this so one of the things I like the</span> <span data-start="1448.77" data-end="1450.3">first thing I want to do was like</span> <span data-start="1450.3" data-end="1453.3">friends in this case like now when I do</span> <span data-start="1453.3" data-end="1455.01">a click here now you can finally like</span> <span data-start="1455.01" data-end="1459.96">modify you can modify the text in it</span> <span data-start="1459.96" data-end="1461.55">like you have some parameters of this</span> <span data-start="1461.55" data-end="1463.74">thing so in this case we can just change</span> <span data-start="1463.74" data-end="1476.37">and for like no you're going to change</span> <span data-start="1476.37" data-end="1478.38">it even one whenever it's playing if</span> <span data-start="1478.38" data-end="1480.27">that's something you want to do for some</span> <span data-start="1480.27" data-end="1485.04">reason</span> <span data-start="1485.05" data-end="1486.88">and to do a little bit more like</span> <span data-start="1486.88" data-end="1488.23">something interesting we can also move</span> <span data-start="1488.23" data-end="1511.739">the camera to say something cheesy</span> <span data-start="1511.749" data-end="1514.489">only have too many other promises this</span> <span data-start="1514.489" data-end="1517.19">one like here we can change instead of</span> <span data-start="1517.19" data-end="1519.73">being the flashy and this kind of blue</span> <span data-start="1519.73" data-end="1522.409">why we can change it to be like what</span> <span data-start="1522.409" data-end="1524.539">about the color and we already see how</span> <span data-start="1524.539" data-end="1540.049">it's that's what that was kind of the</span> <span data-start="1540.049" data-end="1543.049">first thing then I all these that wasn't</span> <span data-start="1543.049" data-end="1545.119">it's not like very nice like for</span> <span data-start="1545.119" data-end="1547.639">instance in this scene we set up Anna</span> <span data-start="1547.639" data-end="1550.19">you can say it like we set up the XY set</span> <span data-start="1550.19" data-end="1552.799">the position where the camera starts and</span> <span data-start="1552.799" data-end="1554.6">the actual set of a position where the</span> <span data-start="1554.6" data-end="1557.389">camera ends and this is not like a very</span> <span data-start="1557.389" data-end="1559.789">nice way of like animating things so so</span> <span data-start="1559.789" data-end="1561.379">the next thing was implementing some</span> <span data-start="1561.379" data-end="1563.869">sort of curves into it so you have like</span> <span data-start="1563.869" data-end="1565.94">a camera position and then like on the</span> <span data-start="1565.94" data-end="1567.679">previous tools that we saw like you'll</span> <span data-start="1567.679" data-end="1569.179">have like an editor for the curves</span> <span data-start="1569.179" data-end="1571.1">sadly the editor for the cases is I</span> <span data-start="1571.1" data-end="1572.059">still don't have it but the curves</span> <span data-start="1572.059" data-end="1575.379">internally it's working and I have it</span> <span data-start="1575.379" data-end="1578.239">actually I think was in this non the</span> <span data-start="1578.239" data-end="1584.11">next one</span> <span data-start="1584.12" data-end="1587.07">yeah like in this one this color module</span> <span data-start="1587.07" data-end="1591.6">has a dissipating but this color module</span> <span data-start="1591.6" data-end="1597.14">has a curve applied to it internally</span> <span data-start="1597.14" data-end="1605.28">let's see if I can get this work so</span> <span data-start="1605.28" data-end="1607.92">you'll see that the value it's</span> <span data-start="1607.92" data-end="1610.02">decreasing or like it's increased</span> <span data-start="1610.02" data-end="1611.37">decreased in actually because it just</span> <span data-start="1611.37" data-end="1613.5">goes from like opaque full of fake black</span> <span data-start="1613.5" data-end="1616.68">to the trans friends so you can apply</span> <span data-start="1616.68" data-end="1618.72">any kind of curves internal like linear</span> <span data-start="1618.72" data-end="1620.34">curve the spine curves or any kind of</span> <span data-start="1620.34" data-end="1622.65">even my sinus weight to any kind of</span> <span data-start="1622.65" data-end="1624.24">frequency to any value that you have on</span> <span data-start="1624.24" data-end="1629.19">the on the engine or the top and here</span> <span data-start="1629.19" data-end="1631.89">now for instance in this effect not that</span> <span data-start="1631.89" data-end="1633.3">yeah we have some parameters we can also</span> <span data-start="1633.3" data-end="1639.04">move we can move the timer for instance</span> <span data-start="1639.05" data-end="1642.18">like if for whatever reason we we wanted</span> <span data-start="1642.18" data-end="1643.98">to try it we wanted to see how it looks</span> <span data-start="1643.98" data-end="1646.07">from here Mike</span> <span data-start="1646.07" data-end="1650.01">that's probably too close</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1650.02" data-end="1655.66">I don't think from this one you want to</span> <span data-start="1655.66" data-end="1678.919">try something else</span> <span data-start="1678.929" data-end="1681.91">so yeah like this first thing is still</span> <span data-start="1681.91" data-end="1683.559">working progress I need to like another</span> <span data-start="1683.559" data-end="1685.929">panel on like where the ten money's to</span> <span data-start="1685.929" data-end="1688.72">be able to certainly try to do need to</span> <span data-start="1688.72" data-end="1691.27">decide how the format is and how it</span> <span data-start="1691.27" data-end="1693.13">whether they're in sync with the block</span> <span data-start="1693.13" data-end="1694.72">or whether they are like using their own</span> <span data-start="1694.72" data-end="1697.39">time or whatever but this is kind of</span> <span data-start="1697.39" data-end="1698.5">something like this is kind of the</span> <span data-start="1698.5" data-end="1700.33">latest version and this is how it</span> <span data-start="1700.33" data-end="1703.059">starting to work for the module like</span> <span data-start="1703.059" data-end="1706.48">this week for the module system this</span> <span data-start="1706.48" data-end="1708.61">week I started to like I had something</span> <span data-start="1708.61" data-end="1710.44">like really ugly before implemented it</span> <span data-start="1710.44" data-end="1712.12">was everything was like in in global</span> <span data-start="1712.12" data-end="1715.03">scope like you will define like like</span> <span data-start="1715.03" data-end="1717.97">like image module equals function and</span> <span data-start="1717.97" data-end="1719.98">then everything every other module knows</span> <span data-start="1719.98" data-end="1722.02">the name of the other modules so that</span> <span data-start="1722.02" data-end="1725.44">was obviously ugly and I'm this week I</span> <span data-start="1725.44" data-end="1727.9">started doing a new try to define a new</span> <span data-start="1727.9" data-end="1730.96">module code for it a module part of me</span> <span data-start="1730.96" data-end="1733.12">this is what I have so far but I had to</span> <span data-start="1733.12" data-end="1734.26">fill it that this is not the best thing</span> <span data-start="1734.26" data-end="1736">like probably something like requires</span> <span data-start="1736" data-end="1738.37">yes or like AMD or something that I had</span> <span data-start="1738.37" data-end="1740.89">to look how is the best way to intern</span> <span data-start="1740.89" data-end="1742.929">and all this stuff but this will be like</span> <span data-start="1742.929" data-end="1744.669">a module like this code is like what</span> <span data-start="1744.669" data-end="1747.4">what you will what you then like you</span> <span data-start="1747.4" data-end="1749.29">just a J's father you can drag into the</span> <span data-start="1749.29" data-end="1751.51">tool and use that as a resource for</span> <span data-start="1751.51" data-end="1753.16">anything like it can be like a flash it</span> <span data-start="1753.16" data-end="1754.57">can be like a 3tc and it has some</span> <span data-start="1754.57" data-end="1756.85">parameters or whatever so this is kind</span> <span data-start="1756.85" data-end="1758.77">of the basic of it like like a module</span> <span data-start="1758.77" data-end="1761.77">has like parameters and any function</span> <span data-start="1761.77" data-end="1763.84">that it is whatever you need to create</span> <span data-start="1763.84" data-end="1766.059">something or whatever it's like you need</span> <span data-start="1766.059" data-end="1768.309">to initialize any kind of geometry so</span> <span data-start="1768.309" data-end="1771.07">things like this the loads still not is</span> <span data-start="1771.07" data-end="1775.7">not implemented yet</span> <span data-start="1775.71" data-end="1780.37">the start is whenever the effect that</span> <span data-start="1780.37" data-end="1781.99">whenever the module is gonna be rendered</span> <span data-start="1781.99" data-end="1783.49">for the first time this is being called</span> <span data-start="1783.49" data-end="1786.13">so so you can setup your effect and then</span> <span data-start="1786.13" data-end="1787.72">the update is just a method that is</span> <span data-start="1787.72" data-end="1790.09">called like every frame that the module</span> <span data-start="1790.09" data-end="1792.4">is rendering and it's sending the</span> <span data-start="1792.4" data-end="1794.89">parameters it's like say the animation</span> <span data-start="1794.89" data-end="1796.57">is moving or like there is some sort of</span> <span data-start="1796.57" data-end="1798.58">movie for like core animation or</span> <span data-start="1798.58" data-end="1800.11">anything like this but you get it from</span> <span data-start="1800.11" data-end="1801.78">the parameters</span> <span data-start="1801.78" data-end="1806.22">so for instance this is how module looks</span> <span data-start="1806.22" data-end="1811.559">for just a single flats color like in</span> <span data-start="1811.559" data-end="1813.57">this case I'm using three but this you</span> <span data-start="1813.57" data-end="1815.16">can use whatever you want like it can be</span> <span data-start="1815.16" data-end="1817.11">done like for any other like any other</span> <span data-start="1817.11" data-end="1818.85">library it like this is agnostic it</span> <span data-start="1818.85" data-end="1820.38">doesn't it doesn't know what three J's</span> <span data-start="1820.38" data-end="1823.77">is so in this case for instance we're</span> <span data-start="1823.77" data-end="1826.59">withdrawing this flat color and so so in</span> <span data-start="1826.59" data-end="1828.809">3d one year what you want to do for like</span> <span data-start="1828.809" data-end="1830.79">one during college is the plane is</span> <span data-start="1830.79" data-end="1832.98">creating a orthographic camera which is</span> <span data-start="1832.98" data-end="1835.2">always going to be like this it has no</span> <span data-start="1835.2" data-end="1837.179">perspective and then you create a plane</span> <span data-start="1837.179" data-end="1839.94">and then that plane has a color so in</span> <span data-start="1839.94" data-end="1842.07">this case we're creating a autographic</span> <span data-start="1842.07" data-end="1844.59">camera and then a scene then a material</span> <span data-start="1844.59" data-end="1848.61">isn't select a material which is the one</span> <span data-start="1848.61" data-end="1849.98">that we're going to change the color on</span> <span data-start="1849.98" data-end="1853.83">then create a plane geometry which is</span> <span data-start="1853.83" data-end="1856.37">just a quad that we need to draw with</span> <span data-start="1856.37" data-end="1858.72">like a mesh with the geometry in this</span> <span data-start="1858.72" data-end="1861.69">material so this in this is kind of ugly</span> <span data-start="1861.69" data-end="1864.57">like and right now the this effect needs</span> <span data-start="1864.57" data-end="1866.13">to know about the render where it is but</span> <span data-start="1866.13" data-end="1868.5">the runner is another module so this is</span> <span data-start="1868.5" data-end="1870.57">the dependency issue that I still need</span> <span data-start="1870.57" data-end="1875.01">to work on and then all with all this</span> <span data-start="1875.01" data-end="1877.919">set up and you have defined a module and</span> <span data-start="1877.919" data-end="1879.39">then you have the parameters that is</span> <span data-start="1879.39" data-end="1882.36">like color put aside color and then like</span> <span data-start="1882.36" data-end="1883.53">this is the default value and you can</span> <span data-start="1883.53" data-end="1885.75">specify some ranges especially for Matic</span> <span data-start="1885.75" data-end="1888.69">floats which is like a normal number of</span> <span data-start="1888.69" data-end="1891.419">decimals so for flow will be like for</span> <span data-start="1891.419" data-end="1895.679">like opacity and then in this case we</span> <span data-start="1895.679" data-end="1897.03">don't have a window needed start so we</span> <span data-start="1897.03" data-end="1898.679">don't need in it or anything because</span> <span data-start="1898.679" data-end="1900.96">it's always going to be there so this</span> <span data-start="1900.96" data-end="1904.77">this one has a update method that in</span> <span data-start="1904.77" data-end="1906.69">every every time that is being called</span> <span data-start="1906.69" data-end="1909.179">every render time is going to set the</span> <span data-start="1909.179" data-end="1911.429">the color the material to whatever the</span> <span data-start="1911.429" data-end="1913.559">parameter color is and that primary</span> <span data-start="1913.559" data-end="1915.15">color don't change because we're kind of</span> <span data-start="1915.15" data-end="1916.62">we have I mean we can have any curve</span> <span data-start="1916.62" data-end="1919.049">applied to it same thing with the passes</span> <span data-start="1919.049" data-end="1920.49">it just has the opacity and then it</span> <span data-start="1920.49" data-end="1921.059">renders</span> <span data-start="1921.059" data-end="1923.76">so in this case we have like we have</span> <span data-start="1923.76" data-end="1925.2">like the weather what you'll run there</span> <span data-start="1925.2" data-end="1927.72">like kind of an on top of it which only</span> <span data-start="1927.72" data-end="1929.429">does initialization it doesn't really do</span> <span data-start="1929.429" data-end="1931.23">anything an update and then it has this</span> <span data-start="1931.23" data-end="1933.31">scene that it renders that scene and</span> <span data-start="1933.31" data-end="1935.26">in this case you need to flush something</span> <span data-start="1935.26" data-end="1937.63">unitive like any flat color that it is</span> <span data-start="1937.63" data-end="1938.89">another renderer</span> <span data-start="1938.89" data-end="1941.89">with this sin and this is more less how</span> <span data-start="1941.89" data-end="1945.19">it's looking so far so the next thing</span> <span data-start="1945.19" data-end="1948.39">when I work which is kind of the obvious</span> <span data-start="1948.39" data-end="1951.91">sorry it's kind of the obvious thing</span> <span data-start="1951.91" data-end="1954.15">like yeah this is free interesting and</span> <span data-start="1954.15" data-end="1956.41">really useful especially for me because</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1956.41" data-end="1958.39">I know how to build this thing on how to</span> <span data-start="1958.39" data-end="1960.82">where all the parts are but it will be</span> <span data-start="1960.82" data-end="1963.58">nice if it was like something on the</span> <span data-start="1963.58" data-end="1965.86">edges for that you go here and then you</span> <span data-start="1965.86" data-end="1968.53">can use publish so publish is basically</span> <span data-start="1968.53" data-end="1970.84">means exporting or creating a sip file</span> <span data-start="1970.84" data-end="1973.36">with the HTML file and everything that</span> <span data-start="1973.36" data-end="1974.77">you need so you can upload it to your</span> <span data-start="1974.77" data-end="1976.96">website and then publish it on your</span> <span data-start="1976.96" data-end="1981.76">website and this is one it's not as easy</span> <span data-start="1981.76" data-end="1985.42">as it sounds like I'll try to work on it</span> <span data-start="1985.42" data-end="1987.79">for the like as the next thing also for</span> <span data-start="1987.79" data-end="1989.35">like also the features editor need</span> <span data-start="1989.35" data-end="1992.29">something like this yeah this is pretty</span> <span data-start="1992.29" data-end="1993.19">much what I have so far</span> <span data-start="1993.19" data-end="1996.4">and that's it it's certain sources and</span> <span data-start="1996.4" data-end="1998.05">github already it's always been there so</span> <span data-start="1998.05" data-end="2000.03">you want to guys your anyone when I have</span> <span data-start="2000.03" data-end="2002.88">to take a look-see bit at some point</span> <span data-start="2002.88" data-end="2003.86">like feel free</span> </p>
