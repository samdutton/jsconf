data-end="866.21">because this also came up recently if</span> <span data-start="866.21" data-end="869.24">you have a SVG that you're applying as a</span> <span data-start="869.24" data-end="871.37">background so I have this image of an</span> <span data-start="871.37" data-end="873.23">octopus apply its background you can't</span> <span data-start="873.23"

data-end="880.4">have multiple colors either if you want</span> <span data-start="880.4" data-end="882.89">to have this dynamic range so what you</span> <span data-start="882.89" data-end="885.23">do is you can use filters for this so</span> <span data-start="885.23" data-end="886.91">filters are pretty well supported</span> <span data-start="886.91" data-end="888.47">actually what you can do isn't it just</span> <span data-start="888.47" data-end="890.3">like the brightness I can make this like</span> <span data-start="890.3" data-end="893.81">darker if I wanted to I could adjust the</span> <span data-start="893.81" data-end="896.24">contrast I could increase that to two</span> <span data-start="896.24" data-end="899.12">and then the next thing that people will</span> <span data-start="899.12" data-end="900.38">mention is well what about the color if</span> <span data-start="900.38" data-end="901.79">you can't change it from black and white</span> <span data-start="901.79" data-end="905.39">to a color if you wanted to but you can</span> <span data-start="905.39" data-end="908.99">because we have the sepia filter so we</span> <span data-start="908.99" data-end="910.64">can apply the sepia filter and then on</span> <span data-start="910.64" data-end="912.65">top of that we can apply a hue rotation</span> <span data-start="912.65" data-end="914.67">so I can apply a hero tation to like six</span> <span data-start="914.67" data-end="916.47">degrees and now I have a green octopus</span> <span data-start="916.47" data-end="918.3">and from here I can use saturate and</span> <span data-start="918.3" data-end="920.37">saturate it too so I have like a bright</span> <span data-start="920.37" data-end="922.29">green

don't need to go</span> <span data-start="925.86" data-end="927.36">into code change the way that you're</span> <span data-start="927.36" data-end="930.66">creating these UIs and just use these to</span> <span data-start="930.66" data-end="932.28">apply different effects and because it</span> <span data-start="932.28" data-end="934.35">is a CSS filter they are animatable</span> <span data-start="934.35" data-end="936.78">they're interactive you can do anything</span> <span data-start="936.78" data-end="938.91">you want with hover States etc for a</span> <span data-start="938.91"

quickly</span> <span data-start="944.4" data-end="946.56">talk about SVG filter effects because</span> <span data-start="946.56" data-end="948.33">this is really where you have a lot of</span> <span data-start="948.33" data-end="950.61">control when you're editing your images</span> <span data-start="950.61" data-end="952.53">and it's because with SVG filter effects</span> <span data-start="952.53" data-end="954">it's really the only place that you can</span> <span data-start="954" data-end="956.16">control the individual channels the red</span> <span data-start="956.16"
