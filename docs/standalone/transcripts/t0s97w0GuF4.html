data-end="782.949">the size and complexity of your app so</span> <span data-start="782.949" data-end="784.959">as I mentioned before we force people to</span> <span data-start="784.959"

a</span> <span data-start="832.24" data-end="834.4">great plan for data flow out of the box</span> <span data-start="834.4" data-end="838.96">we were like just you set state but when</span> <span data-start="838.96" data-end="840.64">you have an appt with a deeply nested</span> <span data-start="840.64" data-end="843.67">component structure then you fed to data</span> <span data-start="843.67"

data-end="851.62">using redux and we have a higher order</span> <span data-start="851.62" data-end="855.04">component that fetches data so it's much</span> <span data-start="855.04" data-end="857.17">easier and we should have set that up</span> <span data-start="857.17" data-end="862.51">straight out of the box a mistake that</span> <span data-start="862.51" data-end="866.08">denzel made was coupling data fetching</span> <span data-start="866.08" data-end="869.44">and rendering in the same function the</span> <span data-start="869.44" data-end="871.93">reason why that's a no-no is because it</span> <span data-start="871.93" data-end="874.12">allows developers just kind of gloss</span> <span data-start="874.12"

a loading state and you need to deal</span> <span data-start="881.8" data-end="884.98">with it when you're writing react</span> <span data-start="884.98" data-end="886.33">components you need to think

<span data-start="891.43" data-end="893.5">impacted our rewrite or made it harder</span> <span data-start="893.5" data-end="895.21">was because of people are porting over</span> <span data-start="895.21" data-end="897.01">there Denzel components they had to</span> <span data-start="897.01" data-end="899.08">think about things like loading state</span> <span data-start="899.08"

i'd even go</span> <span data-start="931.36" data-end="933.46">so far as to say the true value of react</span> <span data-start="933.46" data-end="937.2">is testability not speed</span> <span data-start="937.2" data-end="939.82">there are tools down so that you can</span> <span data-start="939.82" data-end="941.98">render a string to a dom node and</span> <span data-start="941.98" data-end="944.98">different and it's still fast but not</span> <span data-start="944.98" data-end="950.8">nearly as testable finally we didn't</span> <span data-start="950.8" data-end="954.58">have a good CSS strategy that was semi</span> <span data-start="954.58" data-end="956.65">intentional because we were already</span> <span data-start="956.65" data-end="958.69">changing so much stuff we

data-start="963.34" data-end="965.02">writing react is that it makes it</span> <span data-start="965.02" data-end="967.24">immediately obvious like global CSS is a</span> <span data-start="967.24" data-end="969.46">bad idea in the same way the global</span> <span data-start="969.46" data-end="973.09">variables are a bad idea because we</span> <span data-start="973.09" data-end="974.53">didn't provide teams with clear</span> <span data-start="974.53" data-end="977.17">guidelines on what to do it was kind of</span> <span data-start="977.17" data-end="979.9">like the wild wild west some
