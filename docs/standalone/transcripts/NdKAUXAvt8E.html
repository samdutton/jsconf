data-start="31.57" data-end="33.67">background about me I had a very nice</span> <span data-start="33.67" data-end="35.019">introduction but a little bit of</span> <span data-start="35.019" data-end="36.25">background about me I've been a designer</span> <span data-start="36.25" data-end="38.17">for about 12 years and I switched over</span> <span data-start="38.17" data-end="40.92">to focusing on code about five years ago</span> <span data-start="40.92" data-end="43.78">and I love color theory like I think</span> <span data-start="43.78" data-end="45.04">it's just a really interesting</span> <span data-start="45.04" data-end="47.7">combination of like science and design</span> <span data-start="47.7" data-end="50.41">and aesthetics and just like human</span> <span data-start="50.41" data-end="52.899">factors with it's a really fun topic to</span> <span data-start="52.899" data-end="55.809">talk about and it's a really it's a</span> <span data-start="55.809" data-end="57.879">really important it's an important topic</span> <span data-start="57.879" data-end="59.289">because it can have a huge impact on</span> <span data-start="59.289" data-end="63.67">your users I'm also mostly from the big</span> <span data-start="63.67" data-end="65.649">square States and so I'm not really like</span> <span data-start="65.649" data-end="67.509">used to all the humidity so that kind of</span> <span data-start="67.509" data-end="69.07">means that this is my current hair</span> <span data-start="69.07" data-end="69.82">situation</span> <span data-start="69.82" data-end="75.49">ah yeah so that's just a disclaimer that</span> <span data-start="75.49" data-end="78.729">that's pretty much where I'm at and I'm</span> <span data-start="78.729" data-end="82.869">qualified to speak about color and the</span> <span data-start="82.869" data-end="85.11">teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I</span> <span data-start="85.11" data-end="89.83">wanted to be one of them so you can</span> <span data-start="89.83" data-end="92.289">trust me I even though it's missing like</span> <span data-start="92.289" data-end="94.3">the before primary qualifications to be</span> <span data-start="94.3" data-end="95.38">one of them which is that you know being</span> <span data-start="95.38" data-end="97.99">a turtle and a teenager and a mutant but</span> <span data-start="97.99" data-end="101.86">that's fine um so for this talk we've</span> <span data-start="101.86" data-end="105.61">got six sections we're gonna talk about</span> <span data-start="105.61" data-end="107.61">color groups we're gonna talk about</span> <span data-start="107.61" data-end="110.229">color associations we'll be talking</span> <span data-start="110.229" data-end="112.3">about the color wheel we'll be talking</span> <span data-start="112.3" data-end="114.25">about color combinations we'll be</span> <span data-start="114.25" data-end="115.599">talking about properties and terms</span> <span data-start="115.599" data-end="116.5">because we've got to be able to talk</span> <span data-start="116.5" data-end="117.819">about it and we'll be talking about</span> <span data-start="117.819" data-end="119.89">accessibility because it's important and</span> <span data-start="119.89" data-end="120.849">you should worry about it</span> <span data-start="120.849" data-end="129.009">so let's get started let's do it so when</span> <span data-start="129.009" data-end="130.45">we talk about color theory you need to</span> <span data-start="130.45" data-end="131.56">kind of start at the beginning you have</span> <span data-start="131.56" data-end="133.15">to like build your foundation and that</span> <span data-start="133.15" data-end="134.23">means we're gonna talk about color</span> <span data-start="134.23" data-end="136.69">groups so there are essentially three</span> <span data-start="136.69" data-end="139.06">big buckets that all colors fall into</span> <span data-start="139.06" data-end="141.73">they are warm cool and neutral so let's</span> <span data-start="141.73" data-end="142.87">dig into it let's talk about it a little</span> <span data-start="142.87" data-end="144.73">bit so</span> <span data-start="144.73" data-end="146.89">warm colors are gonna be sort of like</span> <span data-start="146.89" data-end="148.36">your Reds through your through your</span> <span data-start="148.36" data-end="150.519">yellows and these are generally thought</span> <span data-start="150.519" data-end="152.62">to be very positive and energetic so</span> <span data-start="152.62" data-end="154.78">these are colors like colors in this</span> <span data-start="154.78" data-end="156.31">group tend to have actually been shown</span> <span data-start="156.31" data-end="158.799">to have a physical effect on people they</span> <span data-start="158.799" data-end="160.9">can raise your blood pressure they can</span> <span data-start="160.9" data-end="164.11">increase your respiration they can even</span> <span data-start="164.11" data-end="166.69">enhance your metabolism and so if you</span> <span data-start="166.69" data-end="168.43">think about the kinds of brands that</span> <span data-start="168.43" data-end="171.28">often use colors in this in this in this</span> <span data-start="171.28" data-end="173.079">color group they're often trying to</span> <span data-start="173.079" data-end="175.84">communicate like fun or playfulness or</span> <span data-start="175.84" data-end="178.48">in like the case of like McDonald's</span> <span data-start="178.48" data-end="180.519">they're trying to like one encourage you</span> <span data-start="180.519" data-end="181.72">to want to eat more and then also kind</span> <span data-start="181.72" data-end="183.609">of move you through the store faster so</span> <span data-start="183.609" data-end="186.75">they can you know sell more high-quality</span> <span data-start="186.75" data-end="191.2">hamburgers then we have the cool color</span> <span data-start="191.2" data-end="193.53">group so again colors in this group are</span> <span data-start="193.53" data-end="195.64">kind of like basically the opposite of</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="196.93">our warm color group so they're gonna be</span> <span data-start="196.93" data-end="198.28">a little bit calmer a little bit more</span> <span data-start="198.28" data-end="201.129">soothing a little more relaxing you get</span> <span data-start="201.129" data-end="203.019">like your greens your blues and like</span> <span data-start="203.019" data-end="205.84">your purples in this range colors in</span> <span data-start="205.84" data-end="207.34">this group are often associated with</span> <span data-start="207.34" data-end="209.859">stability and composure and again if you</span> <span data-start="209.859" data-end="211.84">think about the types of brands that are</span> <span data-start="211.84" data-end="214.389">using these colors they're often they're</span> <span data-start="214.389" data-end="216.4">often trying to like really encourage</span> <span data-start="216.4" data-end="217.84">you to trust them so you'll see a lot of</span> <span data-start="217.84" data-end="219.849">like banks and hospitals and insurance</span> <span data-start="219.849" data-end="220.93">companies that tend to have their</span> <span data-start="220.93" data-end="222.73">branding skewing a little bit more</span> <span data-start="222.73" data-end="223.989">towards the cool side of the color</span> <span data-start="223.989" data-end="228.13">spectrum then we have neutral colors</span> <span data-start="228.13" data-end="230.319">these can you know sort of skew either</span> <span data-start="230.319" data-end="232.389">warm or cool depending on the specific</span> <span data-start="232.389" data-end="234.459">blend of the color so you'll see these</span> <span data-start="234.459" data-end="236.23">these top three colors are a little bit</span> <span data-start="236.23" data-end="237.97">cooler and then the bottom three colors</span> <span data-start="237.97" data-end="239.859">bottom two I can count that's fine the</span> <span data-start="239.859" data-end="241.84">bottom two colors are a little bit</span> <span data-start="241.84" data-end="244.84">warmer and so it's kind of so-so</span> <span data-start="244.84" data-end="246.849">neutrals are often basically they're</span> <span data-start="246.849" data-end="249.97">used most often is like the the base or</span> <span data-start="249.97" data-end="251.5">foundation of your color palette and</span> <span data-start="251.5" data-end="252.79">then a warmer a cool tone might be</span> <span data-start="252.79" data-end="254.76">pulled in as an accent color</span> <span data-start="254.76" data-end="258.88">so our final color group our group that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.88" data-end="259.989">I'm going to be talking about it's a non</span> <span data-start="259.989" data-end="261.039">color group but we're gonna talk about</span> <span data-start="261.039" data-end="263.979">mutants a little bit so they tend to</span> <span data-start="263.979" data-end="266.02">also have you know fairly specific uses</span> <span data-start="266.02" data-end="267.94">and like a use cases you'll see the</span> <span data-start="267.94" data-end="269.32">minutes is you know generally pretty</span> <span data-start="269.32" data-end="270.88">pretty focused so if you think I like</span> <span data-start="270.88" data-end="273.719">the x-men or Godzilla or the turtles</span> <span data-start="273.719" data-end="277.66">they have they very specific use cases</span> <span data-start="277.66" data-end="279.64">also have very strong cultural</span> <span data-start="279.64" data-end="283.6">associations which leads us to color</span> <span data-start="283.6" data-end="287.32">associations so whether we realize it or</span> <span data-start="287.32" data-end="290.82">not colors have very very strong</span> <span data-start="290.82" data-end="293.5">associations built into them so if you</span> <span data-start="293.5" data-end="295.84">pick a color that your users don't like</span> <span data-start="295.84" data-end="298.27">they're going to be like pushed away</span> <span data-start="298.27" data-end="299.53">from using your site or using your</span> <span data-start="299.53" data-end="301.42">product simply because the cut we have</span> <span data-start="301.42" data-end="303.4">so we have such strong connection to</span> <span data-start="303.4" data-end="305.23">color and we have relate to it so</span> <span data-start="305.23" data-end="306.67">intensely that it can it can actually</span> <span data-start="306.67" data-end="310.63">like push people away so and and what</span> <span data-start="310.63" data-end="311.83">but what these what these meanings that</span> <span data-start="311.83" data-end="313.39">we have about colors can be a very</span> <span data-start="313.39" data-end="315.82">subjective so they can change or or vary</span> <span data-start="315.82" data-end="318.64">based on the communities or the cultures</span> <span data-start="318.64" data-end="322.93">that we grew up in so so some colors can</span> <span data-start="322.93" data-end="324.64">have variation have kind of one specific</span> <span data-start="324.64" data-end="325.81">meaning and one culture and a very</span> <span data-start="325.81" data-end="327.19">different meaning in another culture so</span> <span data-start="327.19" data-end="329.8">if you think about the color white in in</span> <span data-start="329.8" data-end="332.08">most Western cultures it's associated</span> <span data-start="332.08" data-end="333.94">with like purity and cleanliness and</span> <span data-start="333.94" data-end="335.38">maybe like a fresh start or in the</span> <span data-start="335.38" data-end="338.65">beginning and then in in other cultures</span> <span data-start="338.65" data-end="340.21">and some Eastern cultures it is</span> <span data-start="340.21" data-end="341.98">associated with death and it's often</span> <span data-start="341.98" data-end="344.65">like the color that is worn at funerals</span> <span data-start="344.65" data-end="345.76">it's like a color associated with</span> <span data-start="345.76" data-end="348.52">mourning so you know you can have these</span> <span data-start="348.52" data-end="350.74">two these this one color but two pretty</span> <span data-start="350.74" data-end="352.3">pretty vastly different meanings</span> <span data-start="352.3" data-end="353.56">associated with it so it's important to</span> <span data-start="353.56" data-end="355.39">understand understand that the</span> <span data-start="355.39" data-end="357.1">associations that are bound to a</span> <span data-start="357.1" data-end="358.75">specific color as you're applying it to</span> <span data-start="358.75" data-end="363.4">your product or or your team so when</span> <span data-start="363.4" data-end="364.78">we're talking about color associations</span> <span data-start="364.78" data-end="366.55">red is a color that has some of these</span> <span data-start="366.55" data-end="368.95">strongest associations bound to it and</span> <span data-start="368.95" data-end="370.66">it can be very polarizing it's a very</span> <span data-start="370.66" data-end="373.6">passionate color it can be associated</span> <span data-start="373.6" data-end="375.1">with love and it can also be associated</span> <span data-start="375.1" data-end="377.5">with like like the devil right so it's a</span> <span data-start="377.5" data-end="378.73">very polarizing color if you think about</span> <span data-start="378.73" data-end="379.93">the Turtles</span> <span data-start="379.93" data-end="382.6">we have Raph like good old Raphael good</span> <span data-start="382.6" data-end="384.97">old Raph and if we think about him he is</span> <span data-start="384.97" data-end="386.98">very strongly bound to these cultural</span> <span data-start="386.98" data-end="388.45">associations that we have with red</span> <span data-start="388.45" data-end="390.97">surrended this very passionate color and</span> <span data-start="390.97" data-end="393.01">so is Raphael he is like the hot head of</span> <span data-start="393.01" data-end="394.57">the group right so he's he's a little</span> <span data-start="394.57" data-end="396.64">movie moody he's kind of a Jersey boy he</span> <span data-start="396.64" data-end="399.31">gets a little sassy sometimes and he's</span> <span data-start="399.31" data-end="402.13">just this very like intense character</span> <span data-start="402.13" data-end="404.47">and has a lot of feelings sometimes like</span> <span data-start="404.47" data-end="405.7">when he's when he's happy he's really</span> <span data-start="405.7" data-end="407.629">happy when he's angry</span> <span data-start="407.629" data-end="408.919">and so if we think about some of these</span> <span data-start="408.919" data-end="410.99">like big sort of terms that are often</span> <span data-start="410.99" data-end="412.479">associated with red we have like</span> <span data-start="412.479" data-end="415.55">determination we have anger Rafael gets</span> <span data-start="415.55" data-end="416.99">a little bit angry sometimes he's a very</span> <span data-start="416.99" data-end="418.669">intense character which are all things</span> <span data-start="418.669" data-end="421.03">that are bound to read really intensely</span> <span data-start="421.03" data-end="424.58">if we think about orange oranges if you</span> <span data-start="424.58" data-end="426.11">still get some of that like intensity</span> <span data-start="426.11" data-end="428.06">and that that energy from red but it's a</span> <span data-start="428.06" data-end="429.439">little bit softened if the little tone</span> <span data-start="429.439" data-end="431.27">down if we think about it's a little bit</span> <span data-start="431.27" data-end="432.71">more playful whereas red could be very</span> <span data-start="432.71" data-end="434.719">intense and very like passionate oranges</span> <span data-start="434.719" data-end="436.099">is more playful and a little bit more</span> <span data-start="436.099" data-end="437.15">goofy and a little bit more lighthearted</span> <span data-start="437.15"

data-end="901.399">equally balanced very carefully crafted</span> <span data-start="901.399" data-end="902.899">combination of colors that gives us is</span> <span data-start="902.899" data-end="907.069">very soft nuts off but a very like</span> <span data-start="907.069" data-end="909.98">balanced color combination and a really</span> <span data-start="909.98" data-end="911.72">nice mix of hot cool and then very</span> <span data-start="911.72" data-end="914.139">aggressive and slightly softer</span> <span data-start="914.139" data-end="916.1">combinations and relationships between</span> <span data-start="916.1" data-end="918.559">colors and characters so there's a lot</span> <span data-start="918.559" data-end="919.85">of contrast but there's not necessarily</span> <span data-start="919.85" data-end="926.449">conflict so now so now that we have now</span> <span data-start="926.449" data-end="927.47">that we kind of understand the color</span> <span data-start="927.47" data-end="929.149">wheel we understand how to make like how</span> <span data-start="929.149" data-end="930.829">to start making some color combinations</span> <span data-start="930.829" data-end="932.75">now we're going to talk about color</span> <span data-start="932.75" data-end="934.22">properties so this is essentially going</span> <span data-start="934.22" data-end="936.709">to give us the vocabulary to be able to</span> <span data-start="936.709" data-end="938.149">speak about color a little bit more</span> <span data-start="938.149" data-end="939.88">effectively so we kind of</span> <span data-start="939.88" data-end="941.23">when we're working with it we can we can</span> <span data-start="941.23" data-end="943.06">speak a little bit better to it we can</span> <span data-start="943.06" data-end="944.65">explain it to our teams a little bit</span> <span data-start="944.65" data-end="946.72">more effectively and it also just makes</span> <span data-start="946.72" data-end="949.03">you like really fun at parties she can</span> <span data-start="949.03" data-end="950.23">just show them be like hey grandma</span> <span data-start="950.23" data-end="952.99">guess what so um it's really good for</span> <span data-start="952.99" data-end="954.1">holiday gatherings</span> <span data-start="954.1" data-end="957.13">protip so so we're gonna talk about this</span> <span data-start="957.13" data-end="959.11">let's dive right in so first we're gonna</span> <span data-start="959.11" data-end="962.53">talk about hue so hue is essentially</span> <span data-start="962.53" data-end="965.44">it's almost like a synonym for color it</span> <span data-start="965.44" data-end="968.41">is like a pure color so these are going</span> <span data-start="968.41" data-end="969.79">to be so something that could be</span> <span data-start="969.79" data-end="971.41">considered a hue is essentially like the</span> <span data-start="971.41" data-end="973.48">colors that you might find in a like an</span> <span data-start="973.48" data-end="975.04">8 pack of crayons so the colors that</span> <span data-start="975.04" data-end="976.72">have names so you could say like like</span> <span data-start="976.72" data-end="979.3">red or blue or green the colors that you</span> <span data-start="979.3" data-end="981.07">can really kind of you can identify a</span> <span data-start="981.07" data-end="984.46">name with a word those are often those</span> <span data-start="984.46" data-end="988.47">are often referred to as hues so cool</span> <span data-start="988.47" data-end="991.87">then we have value and so value</span> <span data-start="991.87" data-end="994.18">describes the lightness or darkness of a</span> <span data-start="994.18" data-end="995.92">color and it has to do with how much</span> <span data-start="995.92" data-end="997.99">light that color is allowing to reflect</span> <span data-start="997.99" data-end="1000.09">back into your eye so if we have a</span> <span data-start="1000.09" data-end="1002.79">really dark color or that is going to</span> <span data-start="1002.79" data-end="1004.26">have a low value because that means that</span> <span data-start="1004.26" data-end="1005.97">it is absorbing more light than it is</span> <span data-start="1005.97" data-end="1007.95">reflecting back to you and then if we</span> <span data-start="1007.95" data-end="1010.8">have a a high value that means that it's</span> <span data-start="1010.8" data-end="1012.33">a light color which is reflecting more</span> <span data-start="1012.33" data-end="1013.68">light back into your eye than it is like</span> <span data-start="1013.68" data-end="1015.57">absorbing away from you so in this</span> <span data-start="1015.57" data-end="1017.58">example we have this really sort of deep</span> <span data-start="1017.58" data-end="1019.83">purple that is a low value and then this</span> <span data-start="1019.83" data-end="1021.12">really bright yellow that is a high</span> <span data-start="1021.12" data-end="1023.16">value so we have hue which is gonna be</span> <span data-start="1023.16" data-end="1025.5">the pure a pure tone a pure color and</span> <span data-start="1025.5" data-end="1027.42">then we have value which is the</span> <span data-start="1027.42" data-end="1030.99">lightness or darkness of a color then we</span> <span data-start="1030.99" data-end="1035.97">have tone so tones are made by mixing a</span> <span data-start="1035.97" data-end="1038.76">pure color with a neutral or a grayscale</span> <span data-start="1038.76" data-end="1040.05">of color and for this for this talk</span> <span data-start="1040.05" data-end="1041.04">we're gonna use it I'm just gonna use</span> <span data-start="1041.04" data-end="1043.62">white and black so essentially a tone</span> <span data-start="1043.62" data-end="1045.209">will be a little bit softer than the</span> <span data-start="1045.209" data-end="1047.16">original color so it essentially kind of</span> <span data-start="1047.16" data-end="1050.43">creates a range of range within a color</span> <span data-start="1050.43" data-end="1052.89">so so if you have like created a</span> <span data-start="1052.89" data-end="1054.21">complementary color combination and</span> <span data-start="1054.21" data-end="1055.14">you're like this is a little too intense</span> <span data-start="1055.14" data-end="1056.91">you could start to work with tones to</span> <span data-start="1056.91" data-end="1058.26">kind of soften one of those colors a</span> <span data-start="1058.26" data-end="1063.84">little bit so so tone would be just like</span> <span data-start="1063.84" data-end="1066.06">the the pure the pure to the pure color</span> <span data-start="1066.06" data-end="1069.03">and then within there we have tints so a</span> <span data-start="1069.03" data-end="1070.83">tint would be if you added white to a</span> <span data-start="1070.83" data-end="1073.06">color so you had a like a range</span> <span data-start="1073.06" data-end="1075.28">going towards to towards a lighter color</span> <span data-start="1075.28" data-end="1077.8">and then a shade would be if you edit</span> <span data-start="1077.8" data-end="1080.08">black and you went down towards a really</span> <span data-start="1080.08" data-end="1085.84">dark color so then we have saturation so</span> <span data-start="1085.84" data-end="1088.42">saturation defines the range of purity</span> <span data-start="1088.42" data-end="1089.86">of a color and this is pretty</span> <span data-start="1089.86" data-end="1091.3">interesting so you go from having a</span> <span data-start="1091.3" data-end="1093.1">hundred percent saturated so this very</span> <span data-start="1093.1" data-end="1095.29">very bright bold sort of yellowy green</span> <span data-start="1095.29" data-end="1097.39">color here and then you have zero</span> <span data-start="1097.39" data-end="1098.98">percent saturated which becomes this</span> <span data-start="1098.98" data-end="1101.83">gray and one thing that's kind of</span> <span data-start="1101.83" data-end="1104.83">interesting is that a completely d</span> <span data-start="1104.83" data-end="1106.72">saturated color while it is great it's</span> <span data-start="1106.72" data-end="1108.58">actually like tonal so it pairs really</span> <span data-start="1108.58" data-end="1112.21">this is a great way to find a neutral</span> <span data-start="1112.21" data-end="1113.65">color palette that works with an accent</span> <span data-start="1113.65" data-end="1115.9">color so if you're looking to find if</span> <span data-start="1115.9" data-end="1117.64">you want to if you have like if you have</span> <span data-start="1117.64" data-end="1119.8">a warm color or a cool color that you</span> <span data-start="1119.8" data-end="1120.97">really want to use as your is your</span> <span data-start="1120.97" data-end="1122.92">bright punchy accent color and then you</span> <span data-start="1122.92" data-end="1124.27">want to have a neutral background for</span> <span data-start="1124.27" data-end="1126.64">that desaturating one of that bad accent</span> <span data-start="1126.64" data-end="1127.93">color to that tonal gray and then</span> <span data-start="1127.93" data-end="1129.64">finding it like a range of tones within</span> <span data-start="1129.64" data-end="1132.22">that tonal gray is a really great way to</span> <span data-start="1132.22" data-end="1134.23">build out that that background because</span> <span data-start="1134.23" data-end="1135.49">it's gonna it's gonna work really</span> <span data-start="1135.49" data-end="1136.75">effectively with that really bright</span> <span data-start="1136.75" data-end="1138.87">punchy super saturated color</span> <span data-start="1138.87" data-end="1141.73">and since we're speaking about tonal</span> <span data-start="1141.73" data-end="1144.1">gray total Gray's actually pretty</span> <span data-start="1144.1" data-end="1145.36">interesting so when you're when you're</span> <span data-start="1145.36" data-end="1147.7">actually painting the way you get tonal</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1147.7" data-end="1149.71">Gray's you can take two colors that are</span> <span data-start="1149.71" data-end="1152.47">on equal so total gray like just to</span> <span data-start="1152.47" data-end="1153.85">desaturate a color when you're painting</span> <span data-start="1153.85" data-end="1155.62">you take two colors that are on opposite</span> <span data-start="1155.62" data-end="1156.97">sides of the color wheel and you blend</span> <span data-start="1156.97" data-end="1159.34">them in equal amounts and eventually you</span> <span data-start="1159.34" data-end="1161.41">get to this tonal gray so essentially</span> <span data-start="1161.41" data-end="1163.06">the way you get to that gray color is by</span> <span data-start="1163.06" data-end="1165.82">combining all these elements by these</span> <span data-start="1165.82" data-end="1167.56">these colors together and then you end</span> <span data-start="1167.56" data-end="1168.64">up with this to agree that will work</span> <span data-start="1168.64" data-end="1170.2">really effectively with either color</span> <span data-start="1170.2" data-end="1172.12">that you started from and so when we</span> <span data-start="1172.12" data-end="1175.33">bring it back to the Turtles splinter is</span> <span data-start="1175.33" data-end="1178.57">your tonal grain so so if we think about</span> <span data-start="1178.57" data-end="1179.98">this he's like at the center then he's</span> <span data-start="1179.98" data-end="1182.47">at the core of the turtles he is an</span> <span data-start="1182.47" data-end="1184.36">equal combination of all of his students</span> <span data-start="1184.36" data-end="1186.34">right so he is he's at the center of</span> <span data-start="1186.34" data-end="1187.96">them if you combined any one of them in</span> <span data-start="1187.96" data-end="1188.77">equal amounts</span> <span data-start="1188.77" data-end="1190.33">you're gonna hit splinter cuz he's at</span> <span data-start="1190.33" data-end="1192.46">the core of their being he raised them</span> <span data-start="1192.46" data-end="1196.18">from tiny radioactive babies so so</span> <span data-start="1196.18" data-end="1198.01">splinter is essentially the tonal gray</span> <span data-start="1198.01" data-end="1202.54">of the turtles all right so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1202.54" data-end="1205.81">No so now that we know we have</span> <span data-start="1205.81" data-end="1207.79">vocabulary we can speak about color we</span> <span

data-end="1374.32">as we as we mentioned early again</span> <span data-start="1374.32" data-end="1375.76">earlier this morning like universal</span> <span data-start="1375.76" data-end="1377.26">icons aren't really a thing but if you</span> <span data-start="1377.26" data-end="1380.08">keep them simple like this is this this</span> <span data-start="1380.08" data-end="1382.12">combined with with an error message and</span> <span data-start="1382.12" data-end="1383.29">some some sort of like visual other</span> <span data-start="1383.29" data-end="1384.76">visual cues this is this is this will</span> <span data-start="1384.76" data-end="1386.95">work so now when we put this through a</span> <span data-start="1386.95" data-end="1389.44">color vision deficiency simulator now we</span> <span data-start="1389.44" data-end="1391.12">see that this still holds up I can still</span> <span data-start="1391.12" data-end="1392.47">figure out what's going on and what I</span> <span data-start="1392.47" data-end="1396.1">need to fix to make this worm go well so</span> <span data-start="1396.1" data-end="1397.9">essentially like this is a great example</span> <span data-start="1397.9" data-end="1399.61">of using color to highlight and</span> <span data-start="1399.61" data-end="1401.17">complement what's already on the page so</span> <span data-start="1401.17" data-end="1402.67">we already have icons we already have an</span> <span data-start="1402.67" data-end="1404.17">error message and we're using cop we're</span> <span data-start="1404.17" data-end="1406.02">not relying on color to be the primary</span> <span data-start="1406.02" data-end="1408.61">delivery method of this message where</span> <span data-start="1408.61" data-end="1412.03">we're using it to complement that so if</span> <span data-start="1412.03" data-end="1414.61">we're bring it back to the turtles so we</span> <span data-start="1414.61" data-end="1416.32">take a look at these guys and like we</span> <span data-start="1416.32" data-end="1417.73">are really so far we've been just</span> <span data-start="1417.73" data-end="1419.26">completely relying on color to tell</span> <span data-start="1419.26" data-end="1420.46">these guys apart but really if you think</span> <span data-start="1420.46" data-end="1422.25">about it they all kind of look the same</span> <span data-start="1422.25" data-end="1424.36">like they don't have noses you can't</span> <span data-start="1424.36" data-end="1425.47">really see they don't have different</span> <span data-start="1425.47" data-end="1426.64">like they just they look very similar</span> <span data-start="1426.64" data-end="1431.41">but what we can what we how we can tell</span> <span data-start="1431.41" data-end="1435.64">them apart is with their weapons so if I</span> <span data-start="1435.64" data-end="1437.26">put I put the turtles through a color</span> <span data-start="1437.26" data-end="1439.42">vision deficiency simulator and so now</span> <span data-start="1439.42" data-end="1441.79">you still know exactly who's who because</span> <span data-start="1441.79" data-end="1443.5">they all have very different and</span> <span data-start="1443.5" data-end="1445.48">distinct weapons so again like we're not</span> <span data-start="1445.48" data-end="1447.94">relying solely on color to communicate</span> <span data-start="1447.94" data-end="1450.37">which turtle is which we're just</span> <span data-start="1450.37" data-end="1452.32">complimenting what's already on the page</span> <span data-start="1452.32" data-end="1454.87">or the you know the reptile spine and so</span> <span data-start="1454.87" data-end="1456.82">so now we're communicating more</span> <span data-start="1456.82" data-end="1458.53">effectively and we've essentially we've</span> <span data-start="1458.53" data-end="1461.05">just made the Turtles accessible we did</span> <span data-start="1461.05" data-end="1461.41">it</span> <span data-start="1461.41" data-end="1466.16">alright so to sum up</span> <span data-start="1466.16" data-end="1469.37">we covered six parts and they covered</span> <span data-start="1469.37" data-end="1472.84">colors and conspiracy theories my</span> <span data-start="1472.84" data-end="1475.16">research and references were pretty much</span> <span data-start="1475.16" data-end="1478.96">exclusively being a kid in the 90s and</span> <span data-start="1478.96" data-end="1489.289">pretty sure I nailed it</span> </p>
