data-end="252.319">are the benefits of diversity studies</span> <span data-start="252.319" data-end="255.739">have shown that you know actually less</span> <span data-start="255.739" data-end="257.959">integrated groups do actually function</span> <span data-start="257.959" data-end="261.079">better so and that's I mean if you think</span> <span data-start="261.079" data-end="262.16">about it kind of makes sense if</span> <span data-start="262.16" data-end="264.139">everyone's like you in the group you</span> <span data-start="264.139" data-end="266.9">think that it would work better it kind</span> <span data-start="266.9" data-end="269.09">of somewhat feels right but that that</span> <span data-start="269.09" data-end="270.53">goes against what we're trying to talk</span> <span data-start="270.53" data-end="273.26">about here but we wanted to if the</span> <span data-start="273.26" data-end="274.729">research shows that we wanted to sort of</span> <span data-start="274.729" data-end="277.099">talk about that first off right and I</span> <span data-start="277.099" data-end="278.63">think it's a tendency of people like to</span> <span data-start="278.63" data-end="280.159">be around people who are like themselves</span> <span data-start="280.159" data-end="282.229">right i mean you kind of have a sense of</span> <span data-start="282.229" data-end="285.91">comfort around people who think like you</span> <span data-start="285.91" data-end="289.27">and you can actually get a lot done that</span> <span data-start="289.27" data-end="291.91">way but so so why do this what are they</span> <span data-start="291.91" data-end="294.13">what advantages does diversity give you</span> <span data-start="294.13" data-end="297.64">and and what we're fine like what we're</span> <span data-start="297.64" data-end="301.36">like after Chris and I read a lot we we</span> <span data-start="301.36" data-end="304.06">found like what you lose is you</span> <span data-start="304.06" data-end="305.95">basically are you're losing a larger</span> <span data-start="305.95" data-end="307.42">pool because you have thirty to forty</span> <span data-start="307.42" data-end="308.56">percent of the population that's</span> <span data-start="308.56" data-end="310.63">untapped and we need more computer</span> <span data-start="310.63" data-end="312.43">scientist we need I mean there's so much</span> <span data-start="312.43" data-end="314.5">work there's so much good stuff that</span> <span data-start="314.5" data-end="317.08">still needs to be done that we need more</span> <span data-start="317.08" data-end="321.43">people to do it and by being non-diverse</span> <span data-start="321.43" data-end="324.4">we lose it we lose a huge segment of the</span> <span data-start="324.4" data-end="328.57">population it's also a great way to grow</span> <span data-start="328.57" data-end="334.08">your community I don't yeah JS comp is a</span> <span data-start="334.08" data-end="337.06">crazy experiment that sometimes fails</span> <span data-start="337.06" data-end="339.55">sometimes succeeds and I would argue</span> <span data-start="339.55" data-end="342.73">that the more diverse ideas you have</span> <span data-start="342.73" data-end="345.1">from

data-end="363.01">out on our own experiences that we might</span> <span data-start="363.01" data-end="368.35">be able to have just because we are like</span> <span data-start="368.35" data-end="369.79">somebody else might mean that we're</span> <span data-start="369.79" data-end="372.46">missing out on a good deal of life that</span> <span data-start="372.46" data-end="375.01">we would otherwise be better served to</span> <span data-start="375.01" data-end="377.73">experience if someone once told me that</span> <span data-start="377.73" data-end="379.87">ninety percent of the

<span data-start="384.04" data-end="385.39">percent of the response is based on</span> <span data-start="385.39" data-end="386.8">their history and ten percent is</span> <span data-start="386.8" data-end="389.26">actually from what you said and I think</span> <span data-start="389.26" data-end="391.57">you lose when you don't have all that</span> <span data-start="391.57" data-end="394.39">history you don't have all that</span> <span data-start="394.39" data-end="397.24">background you lose a lot of experiences</span> <span data-start="397.24" data-end="398.71">and a

your culture</span> <span data-start="404.41" data-end="407.5">and studies have also shown like the</span> <span data-start="407.5" data-end="409.75">reverse which is that when you do have a</span> <span data-start="409.75" data-end="411.55">woman in management you have a better</span> <span data-start="411.55" data-end="413.29">retention of your women developers</span> <span data-start="413.29"
