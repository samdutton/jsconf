<p><span data-start="61.1" data-end="63.989">I'm doing a human-computer interaction</span> <span data-start="63.989" data-end="65.76">research basically trying to make it</span> <span data-start="65.76" data-end="68.81">easier to create web applications mainly</span> <span data-start="68.81" data-end="72.03">data-driven web applications so enough</span> <span data-start="72.03"

one of</span> <span data-start="79.56" data-end="84.09">the breaks or the party so enough about</span> <span data-start="84.09" data-end="84.6">me</span> <span data-start="84.6" data-end="85.59">let's move on to something more</span> <span data-start="85.59" data-end="88.89">interesting such as pie charts pie</span> <span data-start="88.89" data-end="91.65">charts are everywhere in xkcd in old</span> <span data-start="91.65" data-end="96.36">windows on walls on genitals on food on</span> <span data-start="96.36" data-end="99.15">blackboards and of course there they're</span> <span data-start="99.15" data-end="101.939">very ubiquitous on the web we see pie</span> <span data-start="101.939" data-end="105.03">charts all the time elf wave for evil to</span> <span data-start="105.03" data-end="108.78">show percentages or just as spinners to</span> <span data-start="108.78" data-end="111.299">for as a loading indicator but still</span> <span data-start="111.299" data-end="113.22">it's surprisingly difficult to make them</span> <span data-start="113.22" data-end="115.29">with web technologies for example look</span> <span data-start="115.29" data-end="117.479">at this very very simple pie chart this</span> <span data-start="117.479" data-end="119.67">is what we'll be working on for most of</span> <span data-start="119.67" data-end="122.49">this talk how can we make this pie chart</span> <span data-start="122.49" data-end="124.079">with web technologies it's super simple</span> <span data-start="124.079" data-end="126.21">it's just two colors it should be very</span> <span data-start="126.21" data-end="129.5">easy right can you think of a solution</span> <span data-start="129.5" data-end="132.18">can you try to think about it for a bit</span> <span data-start="132.18" data-end="133.92">just a very simple tight</span> <span data-start="133.92" data-end="135.69">thing needs to go it needs to show one</span> <span data-start="135.69" data-end="138.599">percentage from zero to 100% how would</span> <span data-start="138.599" data-end="141.51">you do it so when I thought about it my</span> <span data-start="141.51" data-end="143.25">first idea was okay we need to show</span> <span data-start="143.25" data-end="144.66">custom angles in some way</span> <span data-start="144.66" data-end="148.59">let's try skew transforms so we start</span> <span data-start="148.59" data-end="150.78">with a square element we give it a</span> <span data-start="150.78" data-end="153.569">border radius of 50% to make it round</span> <span data-start="153.569" data-end="158.489">and then we add a pseudo element with an</span> <span data-start="158.489" data-end="162.89">empty content we position it absolutely</span> <span data-start="162.89" data-end="165.209">let's give it a background as well to</span> <span data-start="165.209" data-end="166.59">see what we're doing right now it won't</span> <span data-start="166.59" data-end="172.08">show because it has no dimensions bottom</span> <span data-start="172.08" data-end="178.16">50% left</span> <span data-start="178.16" data-end="183.6">50% and let's give it a padding of 50%</span> <span data-start="183.6" data-end="185.459">as well now we're starting to see it</span> <span data-start="185.459" data-end="189.62">let's give this overflow:hidden so that</span> <span data-start="189.62" data-end="192.269">it doesn't obscure our code and it looks</span> <span data-start="192.269" data-end="193.799">more like a pie chart so this already</span> <span data-start="193.799" data-end="196.739">looks like a pie chart with 25% more</span> <span data-start="196.739" data-end="200.19">scape like most times the 1 25% won't be</span> <span data-start="200.19" data-end="201.359">what we want</span> <span data-start="201.359" data-end="203.84">so this is where transforms come in</span> <span data-start="203.84" data-end="208.98">let's try skewing transform so we're</span> <span data-start="208.98" data-end="210.269">sort of starting to get there but not</span> <span data-start="210.269" data-end="212.1">quite because this is not exactly</span> <span data-start="212.1" data-end="214.41">staying in the center but you know how</span> <span data-start="214.41" data-end="216.12">to fix that right we just use the</span> <span data-start="216.12" data-end="226.59">transform origin or bottom left and now</span> <span data-start="226.59" data-end="232.29">it looks more like a pie chart</span> <span data-start="232.3" data-end="238.13">hey thank you but wait a bit because yes</span> <span data-start="238.13" data-end="240.56">we can show different percentages but as</span> <span data-start="240.56" data-end="244.03">it grows it starts showing the problems</span> <span data-start="244.03" data-end="246.41">which you we can sort of patch by</span> <span data-start="246.41" data-end="249.8">increasing the bad thing but at some</span> <span data-start="249.8" data-end="252.89">point it will come back to bite us we</span> <span data-start="252.89" data-end="254.33">can increase the padding even more</span> <span data-start="254.33" data-end="256.91">whether I can't make it infinite so that</span> <span data-start="256.91" data-end="260.12">90 degrees it will disappear but we can</span> <span data-start="260.12" data-end="262.19">sort of get around that we can special</span> <span data-start="262.19" data-end="266.45">case everything we can special case 50%</span> <span data-start="266.45" data-end="267.86">because it's easy to just give it a</span> <span data-start="267.86" data-end="269.96">different colour and have the the on</span> <span data-start="269.96" data-end="272.66">half the the circle the difficult part</span> <span data-start="272.66" data-end="274.73">was showing the angles right and we can</span> <span data-start="274.73" data-end="277.9">give it a SAN over half class and apply</span> <span data-start="277.9" data-end="280.4">and change the transform and append the</span> <span data-start="280.4" data-end="282.02">color and swap the colors to show</span> <span data-start="282.02" data-end="285.32">percentages over 50% so we can we can</span> <span data-start="285.32" data-end="286.85">sort of do it with skewed suit of</span> <span data-start="286.85" data-end="288.62">elements so there I sold it I made pie</span> <span data-start="288.62" data-end="292.67">charts with CSS is it good is it a good</span> <span data-start="292.67" data-end="294.38">solution would you work would you want</span> <span data-start="294.38" data-end="296.51">to work on this code would anybody want</span> <span data-start="296.51" data-end="299.75">to work on this code doesn't it make you</span> <span data-start="299.75" data-end="301.82">feel dirty that we used CSS and that in</span> <span data-start="301.82" data-end="306.02">such a way and pure CSS is not good</span> <span data-start="306.02" data-end="308.6">enough just using CSS to mate is to just</span> <span data-start="308.6" data-end="312.17">claim hey I did this with pure CSS so</span> <span data-start="312.17" data-end="315.08">what will you CSS because of its the</span> <span data-start="315.08" data-end="316.7">clarity of reactive nature because</span> <span data-start="316.7" data-end="318.29">sometimes it actually helps us simplify</span> <span data-start="318.29" data-end="321.05">our code just being able to do something</span> <span data-start="321.05" data-end="323.81">in CSS without actually ending up with</span> <span data-start="323.81" data-end="328.03">code that's maintainable or or even</span> <span data-start="328.03" data-end="330.35">understandable that what the hell does</span> <span data-start="330.35" data-end="332.36">this do how do I set this pie charts to</span> <span data-start="332.36" data-end="335.63">show 30% I will have to say think that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="335.63" data-end="338.36">Oh minus 90 degrees was zero and then 90</span> <span data-start="338.36" data-end="341.72">degrees was 50% so 30 bit seriously</span> <span data-start="341.72" data-end="344.03">nobody wants to think to think like that</span> <span data-start="344.03" data-end="345.86">usually we should just be able we should</span> <span data-start="345.86" data-end="346.94">be able to just set a straightforward</span> <span data-start="346.94" data-end="352.91">number so to sorry for a super CSS</span> <span data-start="352.91" data-end="354.83">solution to actually be a good idea it</span> <span data-start="354.83" data-end="356.27">needs to be flexible it needs to be</span> <span data-start="356.27" data-end="357.95">maintainable and ideally it should be</span> <span data-start="357.95" data-end="360.14">extensible that's not as important but</span> <span data-start="360.14" data-end="361.77">it should be it's</span> <span data-start="361.77" data-end="364.25">good thing if it's also extensible and</span> <span data-start="364.25" data-end="369.24">flexibility means multiple things such</span> <span data-start="369.24" data-end="371.789">as is it possible to change things what</span> <span data-start="371.789" data-end="374.009">things well you can sort of foresee what</span> <span data-start="374.009" data-end="375.72">you might want to change about something</span> <span data-start="375.72" data-end="378.569">in the pie chart example you might want</span> <span data-start="378.569" data-end="380.97">to change the colors or of course you</span> <span data-start="380.97" data-end="383.49">will want to set the percentage so these</span> <span data-start="383.49" data-end="386.759">things should be possible to change but</span> <span data-start="386.759" data-end="387.93">it shouldn't they should just be</span> <span data-start="387.93" data-end="389.61">possible to change it should be possible</span> <span data-start="389.61" data-end="392.28">to change them in line ideally because a</span> <span data-start="392.28" data-end="394.47">lot of the time we'll have a widget that</span> <span data-start="394.47" data-end="397.56">we stylist with CSS and then we change</span> <span data-start="397.56" data-end="398.819">something with JavaScript and with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="398.819" data-end="400.62">JavaScript we can only set inline Styles</span> <span data-start="400.62" data-end="403.11">yes with CSS variables that won't be a</span> <span data-start="403.11" data-end="404.849">big problem because we can just set the</span> <span data-start="404.849" data-end="406.44">CSS variable and then we can use it in</span> <span data-start="406.44" data-end="409.199">pseudo elements so that won't be a</span> <span data-start="409.199" data-end="410.849">problem but right now if we need to</span> <span data-start="410.849" data-end="412.56">change something in a pseudo element to</span> <span data-start="412.56" data-end="415.199">modify the percentage that's a problem</span> <span data-start="415.199" data-end="417.06">because we can't in like we can't set</span> <span data-start="417.06" data-end="419.13">pseudo elements by inline Styles and if</span> <span data-start="419.13" data-end="423">you're wondering by the way CSS</span> <span data-start="423" data-end="426.75">variables have pretty bad browser</span> <span data-start="426.75" data-end="428.34">support right now so it's still a</span> <span data-start="428.34" data-end="434.699">concern so and also it's not just about</span> <span data-start="434.699" data-end="435.96">being possible to change and being</span> <span data-start="435.96" data-end="437.61">possible to change it in line but also</span> <span data-start="437.61" data-end="440.25">how easy is it to change and how many</span> <span

data-start="445.259" data-end="447.24">have to do the more the more likely it</span> <span data-start="447.24" data-end="449.699">is that I will forget one and or that</span> <span

data-end="455.639">how that they need to make changes all</span> <span data-start="455.639" data-end="457.71">over the place so it's software</span> <span data-start="457.71"

is a good</span> <span data-start="463.08" data-end="464.909">thing strive to make your code as dry as</span> <span data-start="464.909" data-end="466.68">possible the opposite who's wet by the</span> <span data-start="466.68" data-end="473.039">way we enjoy typing good CSS solutions</span> <span data-start="473.039" data-end="475.139">should also be maintainable which is</span> <span data-start="475.139" data-end="478.52">also sort of it's hard to define but a</span> <span data-start="478.52" data-end="480.719">heuristic and it's just a heuristic</span> <span data-start="480.719" data-end="482.849">because you can have tons of code that</span> <span data-start="482.849" data-end="484.44">is very understandable very well</span> <span data-start="484.44"

data-end="721.41">colored my circle with two colors so now</span> <span data-start="721.41" data-end="725.73">what if I add a pseudo element that is</span> <span data-start="725.73"

data-end="758.49">will work is if I use the extended</span> <span data-start="758.49" data-end="761.13">border radius syntax which lets me set</span> <span data-start="761.13" data-end="761.73">the

<span data-start="766.769" data-end="770.48">want a semicircle on the bright side so</span> <span data-start="770.48" data-end="772.98">the top right the top left corner is</span> <span

can</span> <span data-start="802.86" data-end="807.449">start rotating it and it's almost almost</span> <span data-start="807.449" data-end="809.85">getting there what do I need transform</span> <span data-start="809.85" data-end="816.649">origin which will be on the left center</span> <span data-start="816.649" data-end="822.57">so left and there it is now so you might</span> <span

the show percentages over 50 percent</span> <span data-start="843.5" data-end="846.329">ha but the only thing that's needed here</span> <span data-start="846.329" data-end="849.139">to show percentages over 50 percent is</span> <span data-start="849.139" data-end="852.75">to set a background of gold to my pseudo</span> <span data-start="852.75" data-end="855.329">element and then I can

data-start="861" data-end="866.49">percentage I want on it so it's sort of</span> <span data-start="866.49" data-end="867.99">slightly slightly more straightforward</span> <span data-start="867.99" data-end="869.91">you might start thinking well I've</span> <span data-start="869.91" data-end="871.74">repeated my colors and stuff in many</span> <span data-start="871.74" data-end="873.86">places so that's not very maintainable</span> <span data-start="873.86" data-end="876.93">yes I have but I can eliminate that</span> <span data-start="876.93" data-end="878.94">repetition let's eliminate the</span> <span data-start="878.94" data-end="883.079">repetition so here I've set it to f06</span> <span data-start="883.079" data-end="884.67">but it's in a gradient so I can't really</span> <span data-start="884.67" data-end="887.13">use it anywhere else instead I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="887.13" data-end="890.04">set it to transparent and I'm gonna move</span> <span

data-end="900.02">inherit but if I just didn't hear it on</span> <span data-start="900.02" data-end="901.4">the background you see what happens</span> <span data-start="901.4" data-end="903.17">because it inherits the whole to color</span> <span data-start="903.17" data-end="905">background so I have to show it to</span> <span data-start="905" data-end="908.32">change this the background color also</span> <span data-start="908.32" data-end="910.7">okay you might be thinking okay you did</span> <span data-start="910.7" data-end="912.08">this with the background color but what</span> <span data-start="912.08" data-end="914.24">will you do about gold because otherwise</span> <span data-start="914.24" data-end="916.25">we would have to repeat it here well</span> <span data-start="916.25" data-end="919.49">actually we don't because I can just set</span> <span data-start="919.49" data-end="923.48">the color to gold and then I changed</span> <span data-start="923.48" data-end="925.19">this gradient color stop to current</span> <span data-start="925.19" data-end="927.08">color which always refers to the value</span> <span data-start="927.08" data-end="929.39">of the color property if I change this</span> <span data-start="929.39" data-end="936.62">to say green then it changes in the</span> <span data-start="936.62" data-end="938.57">gradient so now I can set this to</span> <span data-start="938.57" data-end="940.31">current color as well because color is</span> <span data-start="940.31" data-end="941.87">an inherited property so my studio</span> <span data-start="941.87" data-end="946.58">element also has a color of gold and now</span> <span data-start="946.58" data-end="951.33">if I change it it changes in both places</span> <span data-start="951.34" data-end="956.69">and also I can make this a little more</span> <span data-start="956.69" data-end="960.23">sensible by using turn units so now this</span> <span data-start="960.23" data-end="962.24">is 10% and a corresponds to point one</span> <span data-start="962.24" data-end="966.02">turn so I don't have to do weird weird</span> <span data-start="966.02" data-end="970.13">math with angles 20% 30% and so on and</span> <span data-start="970.13" data-end="973.55">yes above above 50%</span> <span data-start="973.55" data-end="975.71">it would have to

we</span> <span data-start="981.62" data-end="984.2">had to endure with the skewed hack with</span> <span data-start="984.2" data-end="987.26">the skewed element hack that's slightly</span> <span

data-end="996.17">huge pain to even attempt animation on</span> <span data-start="996.17" data-end="1000.49">it here it's not super straightforward</span> <span data-start="1000.49" data-end="1003.55">but we can do it we will need to animate</span> <span data-start="1003.55" data-end="1011.68">two things the color and the rotation so</span> <span data-start="1011.68" data-end="1022.389">the color will go from</span> <span data-start="1022.399" data-end="1024.959">we'll alternate between current color</span> <span data-start="1024.959" data-end="1029.339">and

remove this one it just</span> <span data-start="1042.48" data-end="1044.55">gets the default of 0 by the way you</span> <span data-start="1044.55" data-end="1047.25">notice I didn't use from and two key</span> <span data-start="1047.25" data-end="1049.26">frames this is because when you don't</span> <span data-start="1049.26" data-end="1051.48">specify from a new key frame or from or</span> <span
