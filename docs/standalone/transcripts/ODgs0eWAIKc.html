<p><span data-start="17.61" data-end="20.3">thanks for coming down here everybody</span> <span data-start="20.3" data-end="23.07">we're from Bloomberg we got four guys</span> <span data-start="23.07" data-end="24.99">here we're going to be presenting what</span> <span data-start="24.99" data-end="28.14">we do with JavaScript we haven't really</span> <span data-start="28.14" data-end="30.39">talked about anything we we do publicly</span> <span data-start="30.39" data-end="33.12">before and we figured it would be a good</span> <span data-start="33.12" data-end="35.1">idea just to kind of show the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="35.1" data-end="37.38">community what we do every day at work</span> <span data-start="37.38" data-end="44.89">which involves a lot of JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="44.9" data-end="48.239">thank you so as you see homegrown</span> <span data-start="48.239" data-end="50.7">server-side scripting so what we do you</span> <span data-start="50.7" data-end="52.53">know as this implies we do a lot of</span> <span data-start="52.53" data-end="55.17">server-side script so first off about me</span> <span data-start="55.17" data-end="57.39">if you looked at the schedule I am not</span> <span data-start="57.39" data-end="59.79">arming I am ng prep rocky Armand is</span> <span data-start="59.79" data-end="63.87">right there so I'm a programmer nardi</span> <span data-start="63.87" data-end="66.78">been there for eight years I work on</span> <span data-start="66.78" data-end="69.06">core infrastructure and making rd</span> <span data-start="69.06" data-end="71.43">productive which is one of the key</span> <span data-start="71.43" data-end="72.63">points here because that's where</span> <span data-start="72.63" data-end="76.53">javascript has helped us a lot so how</span> <span data-start="76.53" data-end="78.3">many people here have heard of Bloomberg</span> <span data-start="78.3" data-end="81.69">before okay so is that how many people</span> <span data-start="81.69" data-end="83.34">fur to Bloomberg because of the TV</span> <span data-start="83.34" data-end="86.909">station or the radio station okay that's</span> <span data-start="86.909" data-end="90.59">good so first employee is Mike Bloomberg</span> <span data-start="90.59" data-end="93.45">he's now the mayor of New York City they</span> <span data-start="93.45" data-end="95.34">wrote the first line of code in 1981</span> <span data-start="95.34" data-end="97.85">that was way before Windows even existed</span> <span data-start="97.85" data-end="100.11">the TV station didn't start until</span> <span data-start="100.11" data-end="101.79">nineteen ninety-four I say this because</span> <span data-start="101.79" data-end="103.71">a lot of people just they view our</span> <span data-start="103.71" data-end="105.869">company as a media company and not as a</span> <span data-start="105.869" data-end="108.09">software company so we want to get</span> <span data-start="108.09" data-end="110.07">across that you know we have a lot of</span> <span data-start="110.07" data-end="112.68">code you know that when the TV station</span> <span data-start="112.68" data-end="114.869">started we've been writing code for 13</span> <span data-start="114.869" data-end="116.909">years already and as of right now we</span> <span data-start="116.909" data-end="120.619">have 30 years of code in our code base</span> <span data-start="120.619" data-end="123.96">that's a lot of code and to let</span> <span data-start="123.96" data-end="125.939">everybody know we have thousands of</span> <span data-start="125.939" data-end="127.92">programmers you know it's a lot of</span> <span data-start="127.92" data-end="129.209">people don't know that if you don't know</span> <span data-start="129.209" data-end="130.86">anything about the financial world but</span> <span data-start="130.86" data-end="134.04">in our offices in New York London and</span> <span data-start="134.04" data-end="137.459">even Tokyo we have a lot of people and</span> <span data-start="137.459" data-end="140.37">making those people productive saves you</span> <span data-start="140.37" data-end="142.23">know e equals real dollars to the</span> <span data-start="142.23" data-end="148.34">company</span> <span data-start="148.35" data-end="152.37">so let's talk about code for a second</span> <span data-start="152.37" data-end="155.2">coat accumulates over time the more</span> <span data-start="155.2" data-end="156.7">programmers you have the faster it</span> <span data-start="156.7" data-end="159.31">accumulates and this is especially true</span> <span data-start="159.31" data-end="161.5">of compiled code you wind up with tons</span> <span data-start="161.5" data-end="164.92">of code and what we found is that makes</span> <span data-start="164.92" data-end="167.95">your company very very slow when I first</span> <span data-start="167.95" data-end="169.96">started there about eight years ago the</span> <span data-start="169.96" data-end="172.6">the development cycle like it almost</span> <span data-start="172.6" data-end="175.21">felt like a sweatshop because the work</span> <span data-start="175.21" data-end="177.4">that people did there like compiling all</span> <span data-start="177.4" data-end="178.72">this code going through this like</span> <span data-start="178.72" data-end="180.97">laborious cycle of testing things and</span> <span data-start="180.97" data-end="183.76">rolling things out it really made people</span> <span data-start="183.76" data-end="187.06">not like their jobs and it also took up</span> <span data-start="187.06" data-end="190.45">a large amount at a time so the other</span> <span data-start="190.45" data-end="192.07">part of this is that not everybody can</span> <span data-start="192.07" data-end="194.35">write clean compiled code I mean you</span> <span data-start="194.35" data-end="196.03">guys see just even in the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="196.03" data-end="197.47">world like what the difference is</span> <span data-start="197.47" data-end="198.82">between good JavaScript and bad</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.82" data-end="201.22">JavaScript now you extend extend that to</span> <span data-start="201.22" data-end="204.46">c c++ even Fortran whatever anything</span> <span data-start="204.46" data-end="206.53">compiled and you have all kinds of</span> <span data-start="206.53" data-end="208.18">issues that you wouldn't even have in</span> <span data-start="208.18" data-end="210.37">JavaScript like memory corruption memory</span> <span data-start="210.37" data-end="212.14">leaks things like that and and when you</span> <span data-start="212.14" data-end="214.69">have 30 years of code accumulated that</span> <span data-start="214.69" data-end="216.48">stuff can be fatal to your company here</span> <span data-start="216.48" data-end="219.85">so we discovered that JavaScript makes</span> <span data-start="219.85" data-end="223.57">people productive so about five years</span> <span data-start="223.57" data-end="228.73">ago we decided to use JavaScript to</span> <span data-start="228.73" data-end="234.97">write all of our app UI glue we the</span> <span data-start="234.97" data-end="236.77">infrastructure team we build complex</span> <span data-start="236.77" data-end="239.35">bindings that hook into like all of the</span> <span data-start="239.35" data-end="241.03">all the legacy Bloomberg infrastructure</span> <span data-start="241.03" data-end="243.22">and for the most part app development</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="245.79">teams are focused on writing product and</span> <span data-start="245.79" data-end="249.43">they write JavaScript that's like a</span> <span data-start="249.43" data-end="251.02">thousand two thousand plus people</span> <span data-start="251.02" data-end="252.61">writing Java server side JavaScript</span> <span data-start="252.61" data-end="256.109">every day in order to make this</span> <span data-start="256.109" data-end="258.91">realistic you need a complete end-to-end</span> <span data-start="258.91" data-end="262.15">solution you can't depend on piecemeal</span> <span data-start="262.15" data-end="263.86">things that kind of work together or</span> <span data-start="263.86" data-end="266.11">having a complex workflow that you have</span> <span data-start="266.11" data-end="268.75">to teach to every new person come in</span> <span data-start="268.75" data-end="270.64">coming in you have to make every person</span> <span data-start="270.64" data-end="272.35">productive from almost the moment they</span> <span data-start="272.35" data-end="275.75">start so what we wound up developing</span> <span data-start="275.75" data-end="279.11">is you know you can kind of think of it</span> <span data-start="279.11" data-end="283.61">as like a grandfather to nodejs back in</span> <span data-start="283.61" data-end="287.3">2005 we made this switch and we have</span> <span data-start="287.3" data-end="289.01">everything that goes along with this to</span> <span data-start="289.01" data-end="290.57">make people too productive we built our</span> <span data-start="290.57" data-end="293.42">own desktop ide we have an entire</span> <span data-start="293.42" data-end="295.01">deployment system with permission</span> <span data-start="295.01" data-end="298.01">handling roll out back outs exception</span> <span data-start="298.01" data-end="300.2">handling routing errors to the right</span> <span data-start="300.2" data-end="303.95">people debuggers memory debuggers code</span> <span data-start="303.95" data-end="305.75">profilers all of this stuff is built</span> <span data-start="305.75" data-end="307.82">into our environment and it all works</span> <span data-start="307.82" data-end="312.29">around jas so like I said in 2005 we</span> <span data-start="312.29" data-end="314.84">started with spider monkey we decided to</span> <span data-start="314.84" data-end="316.64">go with spider monkey because at the</span> <span data-start="316.64" data-end="318.41">time in 2005 that was really the only</span> <span data-start="318.41" data-end="321.95">the only good option and at the time it</span> <span data-start="321.95" data-end="325.16">was about spider monkey 1.6 which if you</span> <span data-start="325.16" data-end="326.87">guys use spider monkey at all if anybody</span> <span data-start="326.87" data-end="328.25">here works on server side stuff it's</span> <span data-start="328.25" data-end="334.99">pretty old now we decided to go with an</span> <span data-start="334.99" data-end="338.66">object-based UI toolkit to a lot of</span> <span data-start="338.66" data-end="341.15">people this will be familiar because it</span> <span data-start="341.15" data-end="343.58">actually started out as GDK it started</span> <span data-start="343.58" data-end="345.41">out as like the general concept of GDK</span> <span data-start="345.41" data-end="348.25">of course it was completely carved out</span> <span data-start="348.25" data-end="350.9">the the guts were taken out of it and</span> <span data-start="350.9" data-end="352.64">replaced with all of the code that we</span> <span data-start="352.64" data-end="354.29">needed in order to make it work in our</span> <span data-start="354.29" data-end="357.23">client server environment but the idea</span> <span data-start="357.23" data-end="359">remains the same it's a GUI tool kit</span> <span data-start="359" data-end="364.22">built around G object I doubt anybody I</span> <span data-start="364.22" data-end="365.84">mean some maybe some people in here I've</span> <span data-start="365.84" data-end="368.06">heard of gob I'll you'll see an example</span> <span data-start="368.06" data-end="370.91">of it later gob was a small project that</span> <span data-start="370.91" data-end="373.16">somebody made on the internet it isn't</span> <span data-start="373.16" data-end="376.1">really used anymore but it it was</span> <span data-start="376.1" data-end="378.2">something that we actually wanted it was</span> <span data-start="378.2" data-end="380.72">a way to write effective G object code</span> <span data-start="380.72" data-end="384.53">without all the croft and all the it's</span> <span data-start="384.53" data-end="386.12">really tedious like lots and lots of</span> <span data-start="386.12" data-end="387.59">lines of c in order just to write a</span> <span data-start="387.59" data-end="390.2">simple object gob kind of hides that all</span> <span data-start="390.2" data-end="392.45">the way and it's a preprocessor that</span> <span data-start="392.45" data-end="394.25">just generates the G object code and</span> <span data-start="394.25" data-end="395.18">what you're left with is like a</span> <span data-start="395.18" data-end="397.82">basically a c-sharp like syntax you</span> <span data-start="397.82" data-end="401.78">declare classes your properties signals</span> <span data-start="401.78" data-end="404.27">things like this and when you use the</span> <span data-start="404.27" data-end="405.79">preprocessor it actual</span> <span data-start="405.79" data-end="409.54">looks pretty nice we had to implement</span> <span data-start="409.54" data-end="411.79">our own equivalent G object</span> <span data-start="411.79" data-end="413.8">introspection layer so when we took G</span> <span data-start="413.8" data-end="416.44">object G object was just G object the</span> <span data-start="416.44" data-end="418.72">gnome community didn't have any work in</span> <span data-start="418.72" data-end="421.9">there related to introspecting these</span> <span data-start="421.9" data-end="424.45">things or hooking it up to scripting</span> <span data-start="424.45" data-end="425.83">languages they were just starting to</span> <span data-start="425.83" data-end="428.71">mess around with serious Python</span> <span data-start="428.71" data-end="432.1">integration stuff like that G object</span> <span data-start="432.1" data-end="433.75">introspection was actually started the</span> <span data-start="433.75" data-end="436.72">same year that we did this but we</span> <span data-start="436.72" data-end="438.91">essentially forked at that time you know</span> <span data-start="438.91" data-end="440.17">even though we're built on top of G</span> <span data-start="440.17" data-end="442.09">object it's everything it's been all</span> <span data-start="442.09" data-end="445.3">hacked now to to work the way we wanted</span> <span data-start="445.3" data-end="447.85">to so we're no longer really derived</span> <span data-start="447.85" data-end="450.43">from that you know we we can't take any</span> <span data-start="450.43" data-end="451.78">of their code anymore because it just</span> <span data-start="451.78" data-end="455.71">doesn't apply to our code base we had to</span> <span data-start="455.71" data-end="457.51">implement our own equivalent of ggas</span> <span data-start="457.51" data-end="459.7">which is a fairly recent project which</span> <span data-start="459.7" data-end="462.31">came about at the same time that all of</span> <span data-start="462.31" data-end="464.41">this server-side scripting stuff started</span> <span data-start="464.41" data-end="467.23">to pick off pick up that project started</span> <span data-start="467.23" data-end="469.48">in 08 and again we have this completed</span> <span data-start="469.48" data-end="473.41">in 05 so give you an example of what</span> <span data-start="473.41" data-end="475.42">some of this stuff looks like this is</span> <span data-start="475.42" data-end="478">gob syntax if you've anybody here</span> <span data-start="478" data-end="479.53">programs in c-sharp you know you'll see</span> <span data-start="479.53" data-end="482.98">that this looks pretty similar the as</span> <span data-start="482.98" data-end="485.01">far as the outer class definition goes</span> <span data-start="485.01" data-end="487.66">inside the curly braces to still see</span> <span data-start="487.66" data-end="490.9">your C++ but we really we liked the idea</span> <span data-start="490.9" data-end="493.96">of gob and so we took gob and kind of</span> <span data-start="493.96" data-end="497.95">made it our own we used the open-source</span> <span data-start="497.95" data-end="500.92">one that exists for a little while but</span> <span data-start="500.92" data-end="503.62">it had a lot of things that were missing</span> <span data-start="503.62" data-end="505.99">so we decided to reimplement our own so</span> <span data-start="505.99" data-end="508.09">we had a guy that wrote our own in oak</span> <span data-start="508.09" data-end="510.55">camo and now it's a lot more complex we</span> <span data-start="510.55" data-end="513.07">have support for C sharp type attributes</span> <span data-start="513.07" data-end="515.68">and lots of other nice language features</span> <span data-start="515.68" data-end="519.34">that again just all preprocess into C</span> <span data-start="519.34" data-end="522.79">code that's built around G object so</span> <span data-start="522.79" data-end="526.18">this this is what my group does we write</span> <span data-start="526.18" data-end="528.01">a lot of these objects we we have a team</span> <span data-start="528.01" data-end="530.32">core team that builds all these things</span> <span data-start="530.32" data-end="534.25">and the app developers use all this so</span> <span data-start="534.25" data-end="536.17">here's an example of this previous</span> <span data-start="536.17" data-end="537.34">object</span> <span data-start="537.34" data-end="539.56">you wrap it and because of the generic</span> <span data-start="539.56" data-end="541.93">bindings which are equivalent to jjs it</span> <span data-start="541.93" data-end="544.51">shows up in JavaScript like this and you</span> <span data-start="544.51" data-end="546.22">can see that you know the bindings are</span> <span data-start="546.22" data-end="548.8">can be pretty smart whatever logic you</span> <span data-start="548.8" data-end="551.86">want to bake in there you can we we want</span> <span data-start="551.86" data-end="555.07">to catch errors before they occur so you</span> <span data-start="555.07" data-end="556.93">know when if you if an object if a</span> <span data-start="556.93" data-end="558.67">native code object takes an integer and</span> <span data-start="558.67" data-end="560.65">it gets something that's that can't fit</span> <span data-start="560.65" data-end="562.06">inside of an integer it's going to throw</span> <span data-start="562.06" data-end="564.07">rather than trying to coerce it or clamp</span> <span data-start="564.07" data-end="566.26">it or something like that that's a</span> <span data-start="566.26" data-end="568.09">general theme throughout all the</span> <span data-start="568.09"
