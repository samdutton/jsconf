the link will have a thumbnail</span> <span data-start="1398.28" data-end="1401.04">in this case yes hot-plug that's me I'm</span> <span data-start="1401.04" data-end="1405.57">sexy but I have a square image as my</span> <span data-start="1405.57" data-end="1408.42">profile although over here is displayed</span> <span data-start="1408.42" data-end="1411.78">in this nice wide ratio that we decided</span> <span data-start="1411.78" data-end="1413.43">would look best for all images there are</span> <span data-start="1413.43" data-end="1416.31">big enough to be displayed like this but</span> <span data-start="1416.31" data-end="1417.63">it's a square image being displayed as</span> <span data-start="1417.63" data-end="1419.34">wide but what happens if you don't have</span> <span data-start="1419.34" data-end="1421.47">a big enough image well we fall back to</span> <span data-start="1421.47" data-end="1424.23">a different more in line version we just</span> <span data-start="1424.23" data-end="1426.36">use the icon and we stretch it in a</span> <span data-start="1426.36" data-end="1428.73">different way you can't do this with</span> <span data-start="1428.73"
