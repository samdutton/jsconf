<p><span data-start="348.099" data-end="350.83">Prabhavati curl is then you can do your</span> <span data-start="350.83" data-end="356.65">things and fix the bug and so now that</span> <span data-start="356.65" data-end="359.349">we understand the process we need to be</span> <span data-start="359.349" data-end="363.37">able to actually make it faster so the</span> <span data-start="363.37" data-end="365.83">first type of variable the account can</span> <span data-start="365.83" data-end="368.59">be is local variable and local variable</span> <span data-start="368.59" data-end="371.229">are easy to debug because they are</span> <span data-start="371.229" data-end="374.8">scoped to a function and most of the</span> <span data-start="374.8" data-end="377.289">time functions are really small like</span> <span data-start="377.289" data-end="380.979">less one than one and red lines and so</span> <span data-start="380.979" data-end="382.659">you can just follow up as a developer</span> <span data-start="382.659" data-end="385.24">and you're going to see why it's not</span> <span data-start="385.24" data-end="387.099">working and why the assignment is not</span> <span data-start="387.099" data-end="393.46">good so at the extreme opposite is the</span> <span data-start="393.46" data-end="396.55">state of your application and if you</span> <span data-start="396.55" data-end="398.979">don't do anything on your code base to</span> <span data-start="398.979" data-end="401.16">structure it correctly</span> <span data-start="401.16" data-end="404.62">the variable can be updated like form</span> <span data-start="404.62" data-end="407.47">anywhere like your state can be updated</span> <span data-start="407.47" data-end="409.24">from anywhere and any file in your</span> <span data-start="409.24" data-end="411.72">system and this makes it very very hard</span> <span data-start="411.72" data-end="414.12">to go back one step</span> <span data-start="414.12" data-end="418.81">so with react what we've done is we</span> <span data-start="418.81" data-end="423.1">scoped the state to a component a react</span> <span data-start="423.1" data-end="426.52">component this means that if a state</span> <span data-start="426.52" data-end="428.89">variable of the react component doesn't</span> <span data-start="428.89" data-end="431.05">have the right value you only have to</span> <span data-start="431.05" data-end="432.91">look inside of this component to see why</span> <span data-start="432.91" data-end="439.9">it was broken so but one file is still</span> <span data-start="439.9" data-end="444.4">quite big and we with react we added</span> <span data-start="444.4" data-end="449.02">another constraint which is that the</span> <span data-start="449.02" data-end="453.13">only ways to modify the states is yet</span> <span data-start="453.13" data-end="455.53">two functions get initial state and</span> <span data-start="455.53" data-end="458.8">third state and because we added those</span> <span data-start="458.8" data-end="461.8">constraints you can just control F under</span> <span data-start="461.8" data-end="464.05">file and look for set state and you're</span> <span data-start="464.05" data-end="465.76">going to find all the places where the</span> <span data-start="465.76" data-end="468.43">state has been updated and this in a</span> <span data-start="468.43" data-end="471.94">couple of seconds so we reduced the</span> <span data-start="471.94" data-end="474.31">search space from the entire code base</span> <span data-start="474.31" data-end="480.6">to a couple of lines in your file and</span> <span data-start="480.6" data-end="485.95">the second type of variable in a reactor</span> <span data-start="485.95" data-end="489.58">application is props so props are values</span> <span data-start="489.58" data-end="491.38">that are being passed from your parents</span> <span data-start="491.38" data-end="494.29">and one of the great property of props</span> <span data-start="494.29" data-end="496.75">is that they're immutable so you should</span> <span data-start="496.75" data-end="499.21">never update your props this means that</span> <span data-start="499.21" data-end="503.25">if the value of your prop is not correct</span> <span data-start="503.25" data-end="505.87">you just have to look for your parents</span> <span data-start="505.87" data-end="510.24">for the call site that was being used</span> <span data-start="510.24" data-end="514">but still the call sites if your</span> <span data-start="514" data-end="516.7">component is only being used one or</span> <span data-start="516.7" data-end="519.61">twice and it's going to be easy but if</span> <span data-start="519.61" data-end="522.25">it's a core component then you're going</span> <span data-start="522.25" data-end="526.81">to have a lot of Co sites and one of the</span> <span data-start="526.81" data-end="527.32">trade</span> <span data-start="527.32" data-end="532.72">of passing things program it declare</span> <span data-start="532.72" data-end="537.07">like of passing things and specifying it</span> <span data-start="537.07" data-end="539.44">is that it's quite viable for example if</span> <span data-start="539.44" data-end="541.45">you want to pass an element from a</span> <span data-start="541.45" data-end="543.75">grandparent or a grandparent to a child</span> <span data-start="543.75" data-end="547.87">then you need all the elements in the</span> <span data-start="547.87" data-end="551.53">between to know about it and we look</span> <span data-start="551.53" data-end="554.56">around and there's actually a solution</span> <span data-start="554.56" data-end="556.63">that for this which is for example in</span> <span data-start="556.63" data-end="561.7">angular the scope all the values are in</span> <span data-start="561.7" data-end="563.35">a rigid from your parent and a</span> <span data-start="563.35" data-end="564.82">grandparent and you're going one parent</span> <span data-start="564.82" data-end="567.34">so this has a good effect of reducing</span> <span data-start="567.34" data-end="569.35">the number of code that you have to</span> <span data-start="569.35" data-end="571.86">write but it also has a very bad effect</span> <span data-start="571.86" data-end="575.95">which is that if a perhaps is doesn't</span> <span data-start="575.95" data-end="578.68">have the right value so now you not only</span> <span data-start="578.68" data-end="581.29">have to check all the co sites but now</span> <span data-start="581.29" data-end="583.21">all of their code sites and all of their</span> <span data-start="583.21" data-end="584.86">whole site and all of the echo sites and</span> <span data-start="584.86" data-end="587.41">at this point you basically lost you</span> <span data-start="587.41" data-end="589.54">have to search like a large part of your</span> <span data-start="589.54" data-end="591.37">code base and it's really hard to track</span> <span data-start="591.37" data-end="596.5">bugs and as a corollary it's also hard</span> <span data-start="596.5" data-end="600.79">for someone to change evaluate at a very</span> <span data-start="600.79" data-end="603.01">root level because you've got no idea</span> <span data-start="603.01" data-end="606.19">was children and grandchildren and want</span> <span data-start="606.19" data-end="607.63">grandchildren are going to be affected</span> <span data-start="607.63" data-end="610.57">so in order to write your you in order</span> <span data-start="610.57" data-end="612.42">to test if you didn't break anything</span> <span data-start="612.42" data-end="614.77">like you're going to have to check a lot</span> <span data-start="614.77" data-end="616.72">of files and usually you're not going to</span> <span data-start="616.72" data-end="620.11">and you're going to introduce bugs so we</span> <span data-start="620.11" data-end="622.48">decided not to introduce this feature</span> <span data-start="622.48" data-end="627.4">and instead having a lot being a bit</span> <span data-start="627.4" data-end="633.25">more boilerplate and again if you're in</span> <span data-start="633.25" data-end="638.44">a developer tools you can just press up</span> <span data-start="638.44" data-end="640.18">and you're going to see which parent</span> <span data-start="640.18" data-end="642.73">components has been called so if you</span> <span data-start="642.73" data-end="644.68">ended in this setup you can know</span> <span data-start="644.68" data-end="649.09">instantly the local sites so it's again</span> <span data-start="649.09" data-end="655.16">shortening the step</span> <span data-start="655.17" data-end="658.72">so this is for profs and States and we</span> <span data-start="658.72" data-end="660.67">also introduced something that's very</span> <span data-start="660.67" data-end="664.27">unique among JavaScript libraries which</span> <span data-start="664.27" data-end="669.91">is that you can type your probes and for</span> <span data-start="669.91" data-end="674.44">example in this case the count value is</span> <span data-start="674.44" data-end="677.14">a number and is if required and active</span> <span data-start="677.14" data-end="679.63">to the world is a string and we're doing</span> <span data-start="679.63" data-end="683.68">at runtime to check those types and in</span> <span data-start="683.68" data-end="686.23">order to understand why it's useful I'm</span> <span data-start="686.23" data-end="690.459">going to step back and look at languages</span> <span data-start="690.459" data-end="693.82">in general so we've got basically like</span> <span data-start="693.82" data-end="696.81">two main families static languages and</span> <span data-start="696.81" data-end="700.87">dynamic languages and if you see the</span> <span data-start="700.87" data-end="703.48">evolution of static languages they're</span> <span data-start="703.48" data-end="707.77">trying to make you write less types for</span> <span data-start="707.77" data-end="710.47">example in C++ they recently introduced</span> <span data-start="710.47" data-end="714.029">the Otaki world which lets the compiler</span> <span data-start="714.029" data-end="717.01">infer the type of the variable for you</span> <span data-start="717.01" data-end="719.98">so you have to write it and now if you</span> <span data-start="719.98" data-end="722.83">look at dynamic languages for example</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="722.83" data-end="726.91">JavaScript and PHP since you don't write</span> <span data-start="726.91" data-end="729.19">any type by default we want to write</span> <span data-start="729.19" data-end="732.43">more types and for example JavaScript</span> <span data-start="732.43" data-end="736.36">introduced typescript and PHP introduced</span> <span data-start="736.36" data-end="740.83">AK in order to that and the combine the</span> <span data-start="740.83" data-end="743.2">and they both converge into what I call</span> <span data-start="743.2" data-end="746.2">a sweet spot which is that you want</span> <span data-start="746.2" data-end="748.9">types and function arguments and you</span> <span data-start="748.9" data-end="754.45">want all everything else being n typed</span> <span data-start="754.45" data-end="757.12">being inferred by the compiler or by</span> <span data-start="757.12" data-end="759.82">whatever and there are two reasons for</span> <span data-start="759.82" data-end="761.07">that</span> <span data-start="761.07" data-end="765.16">sorry and the interesting thing is that</span> <span data-start="765.16" data-end="769.12">you could you can compare a function to</span> <span data-start="769.12" data-end="770.95">a component so if you think about a</span> <span data-start="770.95" data-end="773.2">react component it's like a function</span> <span data-start="773.2" data-end="776.86">that takes properties and that returns</span> <span data-start="776.86" data-end="780.339">of your children and so in that in this</span> <span data-start="780.339" data-end="783.52">case that makes sense to type component</span> <span data-start="783.52" data-end="786.25">props like languages type function</span> <span data-start="786.25" data-end="786.96">argument</span> <span data-start="786.96" data-end="790.06">and their two main reasons to that the</span> <span data-start="790.06" data-end="793.2">first one is all about documentation</span> <span data-start="793.2" data-end="797.02">because the interface of your component</span> <span data-start="797.02" data-end="800.2">is typed this means that you can as a</span> <span data-start="800.2" data-end="802.06">developer just look at this file and</span> <span data-start="802.06" data-end="804.4">you're going to see all the type all the</span> <span data-start="804.4" data-end="806.59">attribute that it that are required and</span> <span data-start="806.59" data-end="810.09">you can call this component whistles and</span> <span data-start="810.09" data-end="814.15">the second one is that it prevents the</span> <span data-start="814.15" data-end="818.11">propagation of errors so for example if</span> <span data-start="818.11" data-end="820.27">you have a bad variable in one component</span> <span data-start="820.27" data-end="823.24">and you pass it to another component and</span> <span data-start="823.24" data-end="825.16">that passes it to another component and</span> <span data-start="825.16" data-end="829">modify a little bit in JavaScript it's</span> <span data-start="829" data-end="832.15">really going to throw and so this bad</span> <span data-start="832.15" data-end="836.71">value can like propagate very far and at</span> <span data-start="836.71" data-end="840.7">one point is going to throw and it's</span> <span data-start="840.7" data-end="843.22">going to be really hard because it's</span> <span data-start="843.22" data-end="845.74">going to take a lot of ups you know to</span> <span data-start="845.74" data-end="851.23">go back to the initial issue and so if</span> <span data-start="851.23" data-end="853.42">you have exit and so if you have</span> <span data-start="853.42" data-end="855.79">prototypes then you're going to stop the</span> <span data-start="855.79" data-end="859.33">propagation of those exceptions exactly</span> <span data-start="859.33" data-end="861.64">when the parent calls a child so you</span> <span data-start="861.64" data-end="865.2">know directly whenever is going to be</span> <span data-start="865.2" data-end="868.39">whenever the problem is happening and</span> <span data-start="868.39" data-end="876.85">you don't have to do those ops and so</span> <span data-start="876.85" data-end="880.66">all of those like it's it's really</span> <span data-start="880.66" data-end="884.44">intuitive to if we have you if your goal</span> <span data-start="884.44" data-end="888.52">is to reduce the time it takes to trace</span> <span data-start="888.52" data-end="891.1">back where the variables get set</span> <span data-start="891.1" data-end="893.83">it's very intuitive to do the step that</span> <span data-start="893.83" data-end="897.43">we've done but someone on Twitter asked</span> <span data-start="897.43" data-end="900.88">me I don't like JSX and I don't like the</span> <span data-start="900.88" data-end="904.9">way the react the is constructed and I</span> <span data-start="904.9" data-end="908.59">want to use jQuery instead and we've had</span> <span data-start="908.59" data-end="911.8">great success from from the CoffeeScript</span> <span data-start="911.8" data-end="913.15">community and the closure scope</span> <span data-start="913.15" data-end="916.36">committee in coming up with new DSL to</span> <span data-start="916.36" data-end="919.92">write them elements so it's not so</span> <span data-start="919.92" data-end="922.769">why not using jQuery but in this case as</span> <span data-start="922.769" data-end="926.13">a fundamental issue with this is that</span> <span data-start="926.13" data-end="929.16">you never know when a components using</span> <span data-start="929.16" data-end="932.1">the jQuery way of doing it is completed</span> <span data-start="932.1" data-end="935.79">and so at any point in time someone can</span> <span data-start="935.79" data-end="938.959">add an attribute to that component and</span> <span data-start="938.959" data-end="942.75">what this means it's someone can for</span> <span data-start="942.75" data-end="944.579">example in this case override the IG</span> <span data-start="944.579" data-end="948.86">element and at any point in time and</span> <span data-start="948.86" data-end="954.899">it's very bad for when you're developing</span> <span data-start="954.899" data-end="957.66">code because now anytime you have a</span> <span data-start="957.66" data-end="960.269">function call in your code that passes</span> <span data-start="960.269" data-end="963.269">the element now you have no idea if the</span> <span data-start="963.269" data-end="965.25">function call is going or not to mutate</span> <span data-start="965.25" data-end="968.73">the element and so if you want to know</span> <span data-start="968.73" data-end="972.029">whether it's mutated or not then you've</span> <span data-start="972.029" data-end="975.029">got to inspect that function and all the</span> <span data-start="975.029" data-end="977.1">function trees that is using this</span> <span data-start="977.1" data-end="980.25">element and we've get we've add in the</span> <span data-start="980.25" data-end="982.26">past a lot of bugs because of this</span> <span data-start="982.26" data-end="985.14">because someone deep in the call stack</span> <span data-start="985.14" data-end="987.72">like this modifies the element and it's</span> <span data-start="987.72" data-end="992.1">really hard to understand why but at the</span> <span data-start="992.1" data-end="995.79">same time once an element is form it's</span> <span data-start="995.79" data-end="998.67">very useful in occasions to be able to</span> <span data-start="998.67" data-end="1001.37">modify it and we need to find a way to</span> <span data-start="1001.37" data-end="1004.79">do it in a safer way and for this we</span> <span data-start="1004.79" data-end="1008.63">introduced the API clone with props and</span> <span data-start="1008.63" data-end="1011.6">clone with props takes an element and it</span> <span data-start="1011.6" data-end="1014.51">takes new props like new attributes as</span> <span data-start="1014.51" data-end="1016.91">going instead of modifying the element</span> <span data-start="1016.91" data-end="1021.949">it's going to create a new element with</span> <span data-start="1021.949" data-end="1024.11">all the modified properties and you're</span> <span data-start="1024.11" data-end="1029.059">going to assign it to a variable and the</span> <span data-start="1029.059" data-end="1032.6">very interesting fact with this is that</span> <span data-start="1032.6" data-end="1036.169">now you any call sites that wants to</span> <span data-start="1036.169" data-end="1039.26">modify this element is going to return</span> <span data-start="1039.26" data-end="1042.23">the modified element and so you only</span> <span data-start="1042.23" data-end="1045.86">have to look at this specific call side</span> <span data-start="1045.86" data-end="1049.13">pattern if you want to see if an element</span> <span data-start="1049.13" data-end="1052.23">has been modified or not and</span> <span data-start="1052.23" data-end="1055.95">since this pattern is usually the</span> <span data-start="1055.95" data-end="1058.889">exception like you trim down a lot of</span> <span data-start="1058.889" data-end="1060.929">potential source of bugs in your</span> <span data-start="1060.929" data-end="1067.919">application and one of the one other ID</span> <span data-start="1067.919" data-end="1072.809">about this is for props and with this</span> <span data-start="1072.809" data-end="1076.499">we're using immutable objects and you</span> <span data-start="1076.499" data-end="1078.749">might think that immutable object you</span> <span data-start="1078.749"
