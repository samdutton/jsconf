data-start="224.16" data-end="228.449">of all the states this is particular not</span> <span data-start="228.449" data-end="231.15">particular interesting perhaps but if i</span> <span data-start="231.15" data-end="237.329">take the exact same same view as this</span> <span data-start="237.329" data-end="241.829">but on the api pissed api perspective we</span> <span data-start="241.829" data-end="244.98">see that yeah maybe you don't see that</span> <span data-start="244.98" data-end="247.139">but it's it's exactly the same thing</span> <span data-start="247.139" data-end="250.139">being rendered almost exactly so this is</span> <span data-start="250.139" data-end="253.59">an HTML have media API and you can move</span> <span data-start="253.59" data-end="258.539">things here interact with with yet it as</span> <span data-start="258.539" data-end="260.31">a regular HTML just strip the sea</span> <span data-start="260.31" data-end="263.82">systems and script tags and if you go to</span> <span data-start="263.82" data-end="267.15">the source you can read a bit about the</span> <span data-start="267.15" data-end="269.46">media type that I've used a documented</span> <span data-start="269.46" data-end="274.139">the media type kind of boring text with</span> <span data-start="274.139" data-end="277.59">some important classes that you should</span> <span data-start="277.59" data-end="280.62">know about some names and some</span> <span data-start="280.62" data-end="283.289">relationships how what</span> <span data-start="283.289" data-end="289.05">some forms mean semantically and I have</span> <span data-start="289.05" data-end="291.749">implemented a tiny Ruby client like ADA</span> <span data-start="291.749" data-end="295.46">lines of code that consume this this</span> <span data-start="295.46" data-end="299.249">hypermedia API in HTML so I can move</span> <span data-start="299.249" data-end="301.559">things for example from the working</span> <span data-start="301.559" data-end="304.199">state to the backlog the kind of simple</span> <span data-start="304.199" data-end="308.539">interface and move them back and forth</span> <span data-start="308.539" data-end="312.83">okay so how am i doing in time here</span> <span data-start="312.83" data-end="320.009">eight minutes yeah okay so what's going</span> <span data-start="320.009" data-end="327.349">on so first let me back up a few levels</span> <span data-start="327.349" data-end="330.959">if you have this kind of rules like</span> <span data-start="330.959" data-end="333.169">business rules application rules what</span> <span data-start="333.169" data-end="336.27">allowed items can go to different states</span> <span data-start="336.27" data-end="338.249">depending on which state you're in or</span> <span data-start="338.249" data-end="340.139">perhaps if you have a different user</span> <span data-start="340.139" data-end="342.389">roles for example admins can do more</span> <span data-start="342.389" data-end="345.3">than regular users or so what are they</span> <span data-start="345.3" data-end="347.279">allowed to see and do and perhaps you</span> <span data-start="347.279" data-end="349.62">have some different rules depending on</span> <span data-start="349.62" data-end="352.469">both the items state and the user state</span> <span data-start="352.469" data-end="355.709">then I think it makes sense to not have</span> <span data-start="355.709" data-end="358.08">this kind of application logic on all</span> <span data-start="358.08" data-end="360.24">your clients because then you will have</span> <span data-start="360.24" data-end="363.229">duplicated code and that's regular bad</span> <span data-start="363.229" data-end="365.61">so it might be a risk that you have</span> <span data-start="365.61" data-end="368.279">actually different applications deployed</span> <span data-start="368.279" data-end="370.889">because they have you have missed some</span> <span data-start="370.889" data-end="373.409">you have a bug in some some part of the</span> <span data-start="373.409" data-end="375.119">workflow and one client and that's not</span> <span data-start="375.119" data-end="377.639">good also it's hard when you deploy you</span> <span data-start="377.639" data-end="378.749">have to have a synchronized deployed</span> <span data-start="378.749" data-end="380.43">because you don't want applications are</span> <span data-start="380.43" data-end="382.289">be different you know this is important</span> <span data-start="382.289" data-end="385.229">stuff business-centric stuff probably</span> <span data-start="385.229" data-end="388.11">what allowed States and and user</span> <span data-start="388.11" data-end="390.839">authentication and authorization the</span> <span data-start="390.839" data-end="392.279">thing that should be in the API</span> <span data-start="392.279" data-end="394.889">centralized but then we have another</span> <span data-start="394.889" data-end="397.83">problem and that is how do is how can we</span> <span data-start="397.83" data-end="400.11">like Express like we tell the clients</span> <span data-start="400.11" data-end="402.389">about these workflows and rules in a</span> <span data-start="402.389" data-end="405.389">good way and the only way I know of is</span> <span data-start="405.389" data-end="408.36">to use rest and more specifically rest</span> <span
