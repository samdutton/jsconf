<p><span data-start="165.88" data-end="167.47">I think that's really fascinating so</span> <span data-start="167.47" data-end="169.21">what I want to look at is actually</span> <span data-start="169.21" data-end="171.04">combining several different CSS</span> <span data-start="171.04" data-end="174.01">techniques to create more interesting</span> <span data-start="174.01" data-end="177.25">and fluid typography and then we can</span> <span data-start="177.25" data-end="179.41">also tie in some other emerging features</span> <span data-start="179.41" data-end="181.72">that will help make that typography more</span> <span data-start="181.72" data-end="183.25">interesting and more useful in more</span> <span data-start="183.25" data-end="186.73">scenarios to more people so there's</span> <span data-start="186.73" data-end="187.99">three things that we're going to talk</span> <span data-start="187.99" data-end="189.94">about primarily and that is CSS custom</span> <span data-start="189.94" data-end="192.459">properties or variables the ability to</span> <span data-start="192.459" data-end="194.95">do calculations with them and pairing</span> <span data-start="194.95" data-end="198.01">that with variable fonts so variable</span> <span data-start="198.01" data-end="199.54">fonts I hope is something that you've</span> <span data-start="199.54" data-end="202.42">all at least heard about but if not I'm</span> <span data-start="202.42" data-end="203.92">gonna explain a little bit more about</span> <span data-start="203.92" data-end="206.17">what they are in a minute so looking at</span> <span data-start="206.17" data-end="207.31">what we have on screen</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.31" data-end="209.53">I thought the Odyssey might be a good</span> <span data-start="209.53" data-end="211.69">way to talk about the way our journey on</span> <span data-start="211.69" data-end="214.45">the web has evolved and I wanted to try</span> <span data-start="214.45" data-end="216.01">and present it in a slightly different</span> <span data-start="216.01" data-end="220.3">way so we have a heading and instead of</span> <span data-start="220.3" data-end="222.31">assigning it in an explicit color we</span> <span data-start="222.31" data-end="224.17">could sign it a variable for that color</span> <span data-start="224.17" data-end="226.51">so we might change it later on and and I</span> <span data-start="226.51" data-end="228.1">think that will have some interesting</span> <span data-start="228.1" data-end="232.42">use cases for that and so this is</span> <span data-start="232.42" data-end="235.86">totally not showing things properly</span> <span data-start="235.86" data-end="239.56">sorry okay</span> <span data-start="239.56" data-end="241.51">that's what it's supposed to look like</span> <span data-start="241.51" data-end="246.4">and so we have the color assigned and we</span> <span data-start="246.4" data-end="248.049">want to start to change those things so</span> <span data-start="248.049" data-end="250">we changed that variable assignment and</span> <span data-start="250" data-end="251.86">so now we have a different color heading</span> <span data-start="251.86" data-end="254.53">we might also want to do a calculation</span> <span data-start="254.53" data-end="257.62">on the size so that we could then change</span> <span data-start="257.62" data-end="260.77">that base size later on as we start to</span> <span data-start="260.77" data-end="263.35">scale it on different screen sizes so</span> <span data-start="263.35" data-end="265.29">we've now done things</span> <span data-start="265.29" data-end="267.33">changed the size and that actually</span> <span data-start="267.33" data-end="268.77">altered the flow of the text a little</span> <span data-start="268.77" data-end="271.38">bit so we might want to actually assign</span> <span data-start="271.38" data-end="273.69">a variable to the weight as well so as</span> <span data-start="273.69" data-end="275.94">size changes we might impact that so</span> <span data-start="275.94" data-end="277.56">here's where the variable fonts come in</span> <span data-start="277.56" data-end="280.65">so we have that single asset that we can</span> <span data-start="280.65" data-end="282.87">then use in a greater variety of ways</span> <span data-start="282.87" data-end="286.35">and this is actually where I want to</span> <span data-start="286.35" data-end="288.6">pause for just a second and bring up the</span> <span data-start="288.6" data-end="292.94">idea about when we read advice about</span> <span data-start="292.94" data-end="296.52">things we do on the web we need to think</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="298.5">about why that advice exists in the</span> <span data-start="298.5" data-end="299.04">first place</span> <span data-start="299.04" data-end="301.11">so I see a lot of people writing about</span> <span data-start="301.11" data-end="304.02">what is good typography and a lot of</span> <span data-start="304.02" data-end="305.46">people will talk about and these are our</span> <span data-start="305.46" data-end="308.04">experienced designers and we'll talk</span> <span data-start="308.04" data-end="310.38">about good typography being only using</span> <span data-start="310.38" data-end="313.47">two weights of a font that's actually</span> <span data-start="313.47" data-end="315.03">not good typography at all that's</span> <span data-start="315.03" data-end="317.73">convenient for performance and that has</span> <span data-start="317.73" data-end="320.76">been sort of codified as a way we should</span> <span data-start="320.76" data-end="323.94">do things because of the reality of how</span> <span data-start="323.94" data-end="326.1">we serve things on the web so it makes</span> <span data-start="326.1" data-end="327.66">for a better user experience if you get</span> <span data-start="327.66" data-end="329.13">content on screen and you're only</span> <span data-start="329.13" data-end="331.05">loading two assets that's a smaller</span> <span data-start="331.05" data-end="332.73">amount of data so that makes sense but</span> <span data-start="332.73" data-end="334.74">that's not actually good typography a</span> <span data-start="334.74" data-end="337.14">single weight of a typeface as you</span> <span data-start="337.14" data-end="339.21">change it in size will become more or</span> <span data-start="339.21" data-end="341.34">less clear and easy to read if you can</span> <span data-start="341.34" data-end="343.08">modulate that weight a little bit at</span> <span data-start="343.08" data-end="345.66">every different size you'll get clearer</span> <span data-start="345.66" data-end="348.66">and more legible type so there's reasons</span> <span data-start="348.66" data-end="350.19">why we might want to do this sort of</span> <span data-start="350.19" data-end="352.44">thing and I also wanted to show that</span> <span data-start="352.44" data-end="354.48">some of these ideas work equally well in</span> <span data-start="354.48" data-end="356.4">the context of a design system so it's</span> <span data-start="356.4" data-end="358.89">not something that is purely for one</span> <span data-start="358.89" data-end="362.04">block long form copy but when we take</span> <span data-start="362.04" data-end="363.69">this thing and we've got our card so I</span> <span data-start="363.69" data-end="365.16">don't have a box around it but you know</span> <span data-start="365.16" data-end="367.05">cards are a theme we know we are gonna</span> <span data-start="367.05" data-end="368.6">use sub-grid on them and everything and</span> <span data-start="368.6" data-end="370.98">we have them here in the bottom part of</span> <span data-start="370.98" data-end="372.42">the layout but if we stick them over on</span> <span data-start="372.42" data-end="375.03">the side maybe we scope the change in</span> <span data-start="375.03" data-end="377.61">size or scale of that typography to</span> <span data-start="377.61" data-end="380.91">where it's placed in the layout so again</span> <span data-start="380.91" data-end="383.64">we don't have to write any new markup</span> <span data-start="383.64" data-end="385.83">all we have to do is tweak some of those</span> <span data-start="385.83" data-end="389.1">size variables and that can be dependent</span> <span data-start="389.1" data-end="390.42">upon where things are placed and that's</span> <span data-start="390.42" data-end="393.03">really kind of interesting but let me</span> <span data-start="393.03" data-end="395.31">come back to variable fonts because one</span> <span data-start="395.31" data-end="397.02">of the things that I've learned is every</span> <span data-start="397.02" data-end="398.46">time I think I've been rattled</span> <span data-start="398.46" data-end="400.5">about them enough I'll go to another</span> <span data-start="400.5" data-end="402.18">event and people don't actually know</span> <span data-start="402.18" data-end="405.33">what they really look like so when you</span> <span data-start="405.33" data-end="407.639">load fonts you typically have a whole</span> <span data-start="407.639" data-end="409.139">bunch of different files that you need</span> <span data-start="409.139" data-end="410.639">to load in order to get all the</span> <span data-start="410.639" data-end="412.08">different weights and variants whether</span> <span data-start="412.08" data-end="414.509">it's with weight italics all that sort</span> <span data-start="414.509" data-end="417.03">of thing but a variable font actually</span> <span data-start="417.03" data-end="418.68">brings all of that together in a single</span> <span data-start="418.68" data-end="421.5">file so now you're loading one asset</span> <span data-start="421.5" data-end="423.66">which is bigger than a single static</span> <span data-start="423.66" data-end="426.18">file but not so big as what you want to</span> <span data-start="426.18" data-end="429">combine and it gives you then access to</span> <span data-start="429" data-end="431.759">the whole range of that set of weights</span> <span data-start="431.759" data-end="434.699">or widths all at once rather than having</span> <span data-start="434.699" data-end="437.91">only one or two so Tristan and Tilly</span> <span data-start="437.91" data-end="440.19">again will help me out where we have</span> <span data-start="440.19" data-end="443.009">variable size collies and you can have</span> <span data-start="443.009" data-end="444.69">that single font file that you're</span> <span data-start="444.69" data-end="446.28">loading and then playing around with all</span> <span data-start="446.28" data-end="449.4">these different characteristics and I</span> <span data-start="449.4" data-end="451.71">hope you'll pay attention to some of the</span> <span data-start="451.71" data-end="453.24">classes that have been applied here to</span> <span data-start="453.24" data-end="454.86">make sure that we're really focused in</span> <span data-start="454.86" data-end="456.949">on exactly what we're talking about and</span> <span data-start="456.949" data-end="460.68">these axes are ones that are chosen to</span> <span data-start="460.68" data-end="462.9">be exposed by the type designer they're</span> <span data-start="462.9" data-end="464.52">not distortions introduced by the</span> <span data-start="464.52" data-end="466.74">browser they're only what is native</span> <span data-start="466.74" data-end="469.47">inside the font itself so you'll see a</span> <span data-start="469.47" data-end="472.77">lot of different variable axes exposed</span> <span data-start="472.77" data-end="474.479">and and we're still kind of learning</span> <span data-start="474.479" data-end="476.43">what some of those axes might be but the</span> <span data-start="476.43" data-end="478.08">more common ones that will be useful to</span> <span data-start="478.08" data-end="481.979">us for you I particularly will be things</span> <span data-start="481.979" data-end="483.93">like width and weight it just creates a</span> <span data-start="483.93" data-end="486.33">lot more opportunity but we also don't</span> <span data-start="486.33" data-end="489.919">want to forget that we also have slit</span> <span data-start="489.919" data-end="493.44">now we have all of these things</span> <span data-start="493.44" data-end="496.289">available to us but one of the things</span> <span data-start="496.289" data-end="498.419">that is often overlooked in a responsive</span> <span data-start="498.419" data-end="500.55">design is how that typographic scale</span> <span data-start="500.55" data-end="503.31">needs to move and change based on screen</span> <span data-start="503.31" data-end="505.62">size so when you have a small screen you</span> <span data-start="505.62" data-end="507.57">have less distraction and less space for</span> <span data-start="507.57" data-end="509.37">that content to show up so you don't</span> <span data-start="509.37" data-end="511.349">really want to have the same scale</span> <span data-start="511.349" data-end="514.229">between heading and body copy on a big</span> <span data-start="514.229" data-end="517.26">screen and a small one so when you have</span> <span

see</span> <span data-start="1589.849" data-end="1591.649">more of these incredible tools coming</span> <span data-start="1591.649" data-end="1593.329">from different browsers as well and</span> <span data-start="1593.329" data-end="1594.919">that's just going to make our design</span> <span data-start="1594.919" data-end="1597.139">life that much better so big round of</span> <span

two</span> <span data-start="1618.71" data-end="1620.96">away before it ships but this is a bit</span> <span data-start="1620.96" data-end="1622.7">of a tease because it's so important</span> <span data-start="1622.7" data-end="1624.5">about font performance in the first</span> <span data-start="1624.5" data-end="1625.91">place that I wanted to give you a little</span> <span data-start="1625.91"
