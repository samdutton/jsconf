data-end="350.24">object it accepts everything starting</span> <span data-start="350.24" data-end="352.97">with integers doubles objects strings</span> <span data-start="352.97" data-end="355.55">and

<span data-start="369.62" data-end="372.14">solutions that we came up with so</span> <span data-start="372.14" data-end="373.43">foreclosures there's actually a pretty</span> <span data-start="373.43" data-end="375.23">easy solution we compile closures two</span> <span data-start="375.23" data-end="380.21">new classes which and these gases have a</span> <span data-start="380.21" data-end="383.83">feeds for for free variables and</span> <span data-start="383.83" data-end="386.81">sometimes boxes four for four barrels</span> <span data-start="386.81" data-end="389.54">that are mutated and then we just put</span> <span data-start="389.54" data-end="391.93">normal methods on them as if there were</span> <span data-start="391.93" data-end="394.88">normal classes and we treat them</span> <span data-start="394.88" data-end="397.4">internally as as classes basically and</span> <span data-start="397.4" data-end="400.43">that's that's working pretty well for</span> <span data-start="400.43" data-end="402.35">two reasons one is that allocating a</span> <span data-start="402.35" data-end="405.35">small objects in JavaScript is very fast</span> <span data-start="405.35" data-end="408.02">and allocating a closure and javascript</span> <span data-start="408.02" data-end="410.09">is smallest size emphasized at the same</span> <span data-start="410.09" data-end="413.24">size as six fees and the second is that</span> <span data-start="413.24" data-end="415.58">every JavaScript engine has heavily</span> <span data-start="415.58" data-end="419.06">optimized the method excesses and in</span> <span data-start="419.06" data-end="421.31">there in the lurch it's just because</span> <span data-start="421.31" data-end="423.259">every benchmark uses that heavily so in</span> <span data-start="423.259" data-end="425.9">the end you are usually as fast or</span> <span data-start="425.9" data-end="427.88">faster than if you had action closures</span> <span data-start="427.88" data-end="434.12">so as an example here we have a closure</span> <span data-start="434.12" data-end="437.41">a dart closure which starts with the</span> <span data-start="437.41" data-end="441.139">they each going to the list index off so</span> <span data-start="441.139" data-end="442.669">this is a shorthand form for for</span> <span data-start="442.669" data-end="445.34">creating a closure and art so the list</span> <span data-start="445.34" data-end="447.259">of map takes the closures that itself</span> <span data-start="447.259" data-end="449.63">takes in each end and searches for the</span> <span data-start="449.63" data-end="452.93">for this element in the list and this is</span> <span data-start="452.93" data-end="455.72">translated you have the tart under on</span> <span data-start="455.72" data-end="458.259">the bottom this is translated into a</span> <span data-start="458.259" data-end="461.409">main dollar closure class so the second</span> <span data-start="461.409" data-end="465.77">second part which has one field the list</span> <span data-start="465.77" data-end="468.319">so that was a free variable and it has</span> <span data-start="468.319" data-end="470.18">one method the cold other one which</span> <span data-start="470.18" data-end="472.699">represents the invocation target if you</span> <span data-start="472.699" data-end="475.069">invoke the closure and in there it's</span> <span data-start="475.069" data-end="476.9">just a normal function which takes an</span> <span data-start="476.9" data-end="479.09">argument and does whatever we wanted to</span> <span data-start="479.09" data-end="481.58">do before note the compact gas</span> <span data-start="481.58" data-end="484.07">representation so we avoid a lot of</span> <span data-start="484.07" data-end="486.02">particle by the plate code by by</span> <span data-start="486.02" data-end="488.96">generating an occult dynamically this</span> <span data-start="488.96" data-end="490.789">way we shrink a little bit the size of</span> <span data-start="490.789" data-end="495.55">the JavaScript the resulting JavaScript</span> <span data-start="495.55" data-end="498.259">so the second problem was was the</span> <span data-start="498.259" data-end="500.99">operators and there the knave solution</span> <span data-start="500.99" data-end="502.669">would be to just add functions on the</span> <span data-start="502.669" data-end="504.979">prototypes of numbers erased rings pool</span> <span data-start="504.979" data-end="508.699">enzymes on and and invoke these methods</span> <span data-start="508.699" data-end="510.38">instead of using the child script</span> <span data-start="510.38" data-end="512.39">operates directly so you could imagine</span> <span data-start="512.39" data-end="514.61">having an ad operator on the prototype</span> <span data-start="514.61" data-end="516.529">of number that takes another argument</span> <span data-start="516.529" data-end="518.51">and only if that argument

work on soon</span> <span data-start="769.98" data-end="773.01">and even if you have a global type</span> <span data-start="773.01" data-end="775.589">inference algorithm that is pretty good</span> <span data-start="775.589" data-end="777.45">you will still have a lot of calls to</span> <span data-start="777.45" data-end="779.43">interceptors in case when you lose track</span> <span data-start="779.43" data-end="782.52">of the types and these are doubly</span> <span data-start="782.52" data-end="784.32">expensive because for one you have to</span> <span data-start="784.32" data-end="785.97">study interceptor calls and the second</span> <span data-start="785.97" data-end="786.959">one is you don't know if they have side</span> <span data-start="786.959" data-end="788.43">effects and therefore they destroy your</span> <span data-start="788.43" data-end="794.04">local optimizations so the big hammer we</span> <span data-start="794.04" data-end="795.48">have for that is the speculative</span> <span data-start="795.48" data-end="799.86">optimizations and that's the yeah so the</span> <span data-start="799.86" data-end="803.1">idea is to guess what the type of the of</span> <span data-start="803.1" data-end="806.58">the verbal would be or instruction what</span> <span data-start="806.58" data-end="809.04">the type would be based on on how it's</span> <span data-start="809.04" data-end="811.35">used and then we try to optimize for</span> <span data-start="811.35" data-end="813.15">this speculated type</span> <span data-start="813.15" data-end="815.1">and the promise of course we cannot</span> <span data-start="815.1" data-end="816.6">always be right and therefore we have</span> <span data-start="816.6" data-end="820.29">bailouts when we are wrong so the give</span> <span data-start="820.29" data-end="821.73">you an idea here this is the same</span> <span data-start="821.73" data-end="823.62">example as before the the sum of the</span> <span data-start="823.62" data-end="825.33">loop except that in this case we have no</span> <span data-start="825.33" data-end="827.01">idea what X is in the previous example</span> <span data-start="827.01" data-end="828.87">we knew it was a list it was in the code</span> <span data-start="828.87" data-end="831.27">in this example it could be anything but</span> <span data-start="831.27" data-end="833.25">looking at the code it put a really</span> <span data-start="833.25" data-end="835.77">great if it was a child script array so</span> <span data-start="835.77" data-end="838.35">what we do now is we just say okay let's</span> <span data-start="838.35" data-end="840.15">check if it's a JavaScript array and if</span> <span data-start="840.15" data-end="842.25">it is and so if it is not one we bail</span> <span data-start="842.25" data-end="844.38">out but if it is one we can optimize the</span> <span data-start="844.38" data-end="846.18">same as before we have this perfect code</span> <span data-start="846.18" data-end="849.9">that is a running nicely and fast but</span> <span data-start="849.9" data-end="853.5">not perfect but nearly perfect and then</span> <span data-start="853.5" data-end="855.36">if we are wrong well we have a bailout</span> <span data-start="855.36" data-end="857.4">function that does the expensive static</span> <span data-start="857.4" data-end="860.24">interceptor calls and does the does the</span> <span data-start="860.24" data-end="862.53">necessary stuff to get it right in case</span> <span data-start="862.53" data-end="864.21">there's an operator overloading and it's</span> <span data-start="864.21" data-end="870.48">not a list and and all these things the</span> <span data-start="870.48" data-end="872.19">thing is that if you do that all the</span> <span data-start="872.19" data-end="874.32">time you blow up your code so we have</span> <span data-start="874.32" data-end="876.33">some heuristics 22 when we want to check</span> <span data-start="876.33" data-end="879.66">when we want to speculate and it's</span> <span data-start="879.66" data-end="883.47">difficult to see when and how we need to</span> <span data-start="883.47" data-end="885.6">do that and currently we just physically</span> <span data-start="885.6" data-end="887.34">say if you're using something from</span> <span data-start="887.34" data-end="889.29">inside a loop and ideally transitively</span> <span data-start="889.29" data-end="890.64">from inside the loop so if you call a</span> <span data-start="890.64" data-end="893.19">function that is in from inside a loop</span> <span data-start="893.19" data-end="894.63">you will also optimize that function</span> <span data-start="894.63" data-end="898.2">speculatively then we do speculative</span> <span data-start="898.2" data-end="900.12">optimizations if I were is just a</span> <span

data-end="907.29">and that's that's future work we want to</span> <span data-start="907.29" data-end="909.45">do profile guided optimizations so we</span> <span data-start="909.45" data-end="911.34">want to say speculate everything and</span> <span data-start="911.34" data-end="913.83">then tell us later on what worked and</span> <span data-start="913.83" data-end="916.17">what didn't work and things that either</span> <span data-start="916.17" data-end="918.6">always made out or never wear called we</span> <span data-start="918.6" data-end="920.55">can't just leave the the

<span data-start="928.23" data-end="930">get another huge bump in performance and</span> <span data-start="930" data-end="932.97">it really really paid so with that we</span> <span data-start="932.97" data-end="935.78">have about 75% of handwritten code and</span> <span data-start="935.78" data-end="938.04">together a little bit on the speed space</span> </p>
