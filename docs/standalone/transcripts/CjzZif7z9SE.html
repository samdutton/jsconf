<p><span data-start="266.6" data-end="271.76">I just made made it up but you might</span> <span data-start="271.76" data-end="274.34">think that it's good we separate our</span> <span data-start="274.34" data-end="277.07">concerns we isolated each component but</span> <span data-start="277.07" data-end="278.63">in the allergy component still depend on</span> <span data-start="278.63" data-end="280.61">each other so if this a new tweet it</span> <span data-start="280.61" data-end="282.98">appears in the main feed it can appear</span> <span data-start="282.98" data-end="285.65">the number increasing somewhere else if</span> <span data-start="285.65" data-end="287.66">there's a picture it will appear in the</span> <span data-start="287.66" data-end="290.33">pictures component so they really can</span> <span data-start="290.33" data-end="293.15">depend on each other so here's another</span> <span data-start="293.15" data-end="295.22">example it's a YouTube dashboard and</span> <span data-start="295.22" data-end="297.38">this is something a lot of people don't</span> <span data-start="297.38" data-end="299.21">see this is a dashboard for people who</span> <span data-start="299.21" data-end="303.17">are plaut videos so you can see my most</span> <span data-start="303.17" data-end="305.06">popular video is about my high school</span> <span data-start="305.06" data-end="308.54">graduation silico but this is a complex</span> <span data-start="308.54" data-end="311.48">page there's a lot of things going on so</span> <span data-start="311.48" data-end="314.48">you have type-ahead search you have some</span> <span data-start="314.48" data-end="316.19">charting library you have a calendar</span> <span data-start="316.19" data-end="318.49">view where you can select something and</span> <span data-start="318.49" data-end="320.3">let's say you want to implement</span> <span data-start="320.3" data-end="321.98">something I exist and you work in a</span> <span data-start="321.98" data-end="323.87">smaller company may be here in Singapore</span> <span data-start="323.87" data-end="325.46">maybe somewhere else you probably don't</span> <span data-start="325.46" data-end="327.89">have two hundred engineers to build it</span> <span data-start="327.89" data-end="330.77">overnight so what do you do if you're</span> <span data-start="330.77" data-end="332.75">lazy like me you will go on the internet</span> <span data-start="332.75" data-end="334.58">and find a lot of libraries that can</span> <span data-start="334.58" data-end="336.5">help you I don't want to build my</span> <span data-start="336.5" data-end="338.81">calendar of you again I don't have two</span> <span data-start="338.81" data-end="341.09">miles maybe somebody olej build it for</span> <span data-start="341.09" data-end="343.76">me right so that's exactly what you're</span> <span data-start="343.76" data-end="345.17">going to do probably you will use</span> <span data-start="345.17" data-end="346.85">something like a package as for</span> <span data-start="346.85" data-end="348.56">type-ahead search you will render your</span> <span data-start="348.56" data-end="351.35">views with that component for calendar</span> <span data-start="351.35" data-end="353.57">you will use full calendar jquery plugin</span> <span data-start="353.57" data-end="356.21">for SVG gasps you'll use some library</span> <span data-start="356.21" data-end="358.58">like this vijay's this is a data table</span> <span data-start="358.58" data-end="360.92">that needs sorting and everything I</span> <span data-start="360.92" data-end="363.59">don't know if if somebody already did it</span> <span data-start="363.59" data-end="365.18">for me efficiently I'll just use their</span> <span data-start="365.18" data-end="368.69">code so here you have several components</span> <span data-start="368.69" data-end="370.96">and they built with entirely different</span> <span data-start="370.96" data-end="373.76">frameworks sorry libraries and they</span> <span data-start="373.76" data-end="376.28">built with entirely different teams this</span> <span data-start="376.28" data-end="378.65">code doesn't have any idea how to work</span> <span data-start="378.65" data-end="381.74">with each other and yeah like you can</span> <span data-start="381.74" data-end="385.19">use something else for this line so my</span> <span data-start="385.19" data-end="387.11">point is you have all the things you</span> <span data-start="387.11" data-end="388.88">need to glue together how do you do that</span> <span data-start="388.88" data-end="392.03">and just to give you another example</span> <span data-start="392.03" data-end="395.419">here's google calendar in case you think</span> <span data-start="395.419" data-end="397.16">oh you just synchronize your data model</span> <span data-start="397.16" data-end="398.95">for every component it's not true</span> <span data-start="398.95" data-end="400.47">sometimes you</span> <span data-start="400.47" data-end="402.69">and on the state of the component so</span> <span data-start="402.69" data-end="405.21">here on the left side you have this box</span> <span data-start="405.21" data-end="407.13">where you can select some weak arbitrary</span> <span data-start="407.13" data-end="410.49">range of days in your calendar and that</span> <span data-start="410.49" data-end="412.5">would be reflected on the right side so</span> <span data-start="412.5" data-end="415.23">it's not even like data that comes for</span> <span data-start="415.23" data-end="418.5">user it's something that is stored as a</span> <span data-start="418.5" data-end="423.03">state of the component so let's say you</span> <span data-start="423.03" data-end="425.37">start developing that but you know this</span> <span data-start="425.37" data-end="427.38">thing depends on that saying blind</span> <span data-start="427.38" data-end="429.33">showed up down only if this constraints</span> <span data-start="429.33" data-end="431.73">are satisfied you will do some graph</span> <span data-start="431.73" data-end="433.29">dependency graph like this by the way</span> <span data-start="433.29" data-end="434.73">it's not real graph I just made it up</span> <span data-start="434.73" data-end="439.26">but the point is it might be simple in</span> <span data-start="439.26" data-end="441.57">the beginning but more features you have</span> <span data-start="441.57" data-end="444.87">in your applications more different</span> <span data-start="444.87" data-end="447.57">directions the activity will go to or</span> <span data-start="447.57" data-end="449.61">dependencies will go to it will be</span> <span data-start="449.61" data-end="451.05">harder to manage and maybe you don't</span> <span data-start="451.05" data-end="453.66">need to is our job really managing</span> <span data-start="453.66" data-end="456.81">dependencies probably not so you may end</span> <span data-start="456.81" data-end="458.7">up with something like this it's all</span> <span data-start="458.7" data-end="460.53">complicated goes back and forth you</span> <span data-start="460.53" data-end="462.33">manage events here you pushes they're</span> <span data-start="462.33" data-end="465.6">like what's going on so that's why we</span> <span data-start="465.6" data-end="468.3">built a small library called tracker</span> <span data-start="468.3" data-end="470.52">it's under two kilobytes when gzipped</span> <span data-start="470.52" data-end="472.08">and minified is really small and lean</span> <span data-start="472.08" data-end="474.63">and the point is to make any code</span> <span data-start="474.63" data-end="477.39">deactive you just wrap whatever code you</span> <span data-start="477.39" data-end="479.55">have into one function call it just</span> <span data-start="479.55" data-end="480.9">instantly becomes the active at what I</span> <span data-start="480.9" data-end="483.03">mean is every time some dependency</span> <span data-start="483.03" data-end="484.83">changes of that function or like that</span> <span data-start="484.83" data-end="488.16">block it will just sound again so the</span> <span data-start="488.16" data-end="490.74">purpose is just to you know glue things</span> <span data-start="490.74" data-end="494.729">together and here's an example a code</span> <span data-start="494.729" data-end="497.58">example you just put your stuff into</span> <span data-start="497.58" data-end="500.07">this checker-outer on and alternate</span> <span data-start="500.07" data-end="501.66">means it will run again at the game</span> <span data-start="501.66" data-end="504.9">again every time something changes so</span> <span data-start="504.9" data-end="507.33">here's another example let's say I have</span> <span data-start="507.33" data-end="509.4">a valuable called city it's San</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="509.4" data-end="511.919">Francisco that's wearing form and we</span> <span data-start="511.919" data-end="516.51">paint both casting from this city so so</span> <span data-start="516.51" data-end="518.58">like first time it will run it will</span> <span data-start="518.58" data-end="519.81">paint I'm broadcasting from San</span> <span data-start="519.81" data-end="521.88">Francisco but next time the city will</span> <span data-start="521.88" data-end="524.21">change it will immediately run again and</span> <span data-start="524.21" data-end="527.16">it will paint I'm broadcasting from</span> <span data-start="527.16" data-end="529.56">Singapore and it will do it itself you</span> <span data-start="529.56" data-end="530.85">just change your variables however you</span> <span data-start="530.85" data-end="534.06">want here's another example just to make</span> <span data-start="534.06" data-end="534.329">the</span> <span data-start="534.329" data-end="537.559">that tracker is not to dump for you</span> <span data-start="537.559" data-end="539.85">let's say we have two variables and</span> <span data-start="539.85"
