data-end="23.18">make jobs of applications cutting edge</span> <span data-start="23.18" data-end="26.369">so we work on mobile basically and we do</span> <span data-start="26.369" data-end="27.81">going to pretty much anything we also</span> <span data-start="27.81" data-end="30.48">sponsor a gyroscope by the way so much</span> <span data-start="30.48" data-end="32.34">for that so I'm going to talk to you</span> <span data-start="32.34" data-end="35.91">today about tooling and Tony we all use</span> <span data-start="35.91" data-end="38.219">tools in our everyday life whenever we</span> <span data-start="38.219" data-end="40.26">use a text editor whenever we use a 98</span> <span data-start="40.26" data-end="42.51">you know testing frameworks or whatever</span> <span data-start="42.51" data-end="43.8">their old schools and they're all I</span> <span data-start="43.8" data-end="45.84">would say very important to our line of</span> <span data-start="45.84" data-end="50.16">work and it occurred to me that last</span> <span data-start="50.16" data-end="51.78">year that the number of tools are</span> <span data-start="51.78" data-end="53.19">actually pretty well you know not</span> <span data-start="53.19" data-end="55.829">limited but I would like to see more and</span> <span data-start="55.829" data-end="57.42">so I'm going to try and persuade you and</span> <span data-start="57.42" data-end="59.01">to show you how easy it would be to</span> <span data-start="59.01" data-end="60.87">create new tools and to persuade you to</span> <span data-start="60.87" data-end="63.84">you know make no tools so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="63.84" data-end="66.39">talk to you today about Xion Xion is a</span> <span data-start="66.39" data-end="70.02">static JavaScript analyzer I created</span> <span data-start="70.02" data-end="74.52">using a handwritten parser and based on</span> <span data-start="74.52" data-end="76.17">the Han River parser I can do while I</span> <span data-start="76.17" data-end="78.78">can for a lot of stuff and most of it is</span> <span data-start="78.78" data-end="82.2">pretty trivial let me try to quickly do</span> <span data-start="82.2" data-end="84.659">the demo thing of course it doesn't work</span> <span data-start="84.659" data-end="87.33">as intended ah alright so this is</span> <span data-start="87.33" data-end="90.18">interesting this is basically what xeon</span> <span data-start="90.18" data-end="96.42">is as you can see let's see there is a</span> <span data-start="96.42" data-end="97.979">pop ups it will give you more type</span> <span data-start="97.979" data-end="101.34">information it knows you guys like</span> <span data-start="101.34" data-end="104.34">static references to lick variables or</span> <span data-start="104.34" data-end="107.25">discs or whatever it does inference like</span> <span data-start="107.25" data-end="110.07">it sees that well right now it doesn't</span> <span data-start="110.07" data-end="113.7">throw but if I would like throw I don't</span> <span data-start="113.7" data-end="116.549">know some string then we'll say throw</span> <span data-start="116.549" data-end="119.82">string if I return if currently there's</span> <span data-start="119.82" data-end="121.049">an object and something it doesn't</span> <span data-start="121.049" data-end="123.96">doesn't know the type of it</span> <span data-start="123.96" data-end="126.2">all kinds of tools right here</span> <span data-start="126.2" data-end="130.14">minification beautiful are I don't know</span> <span data-start="130.14" data-end="133.08">generating jazz docks whatever and you</span> <span data-start="133.08" data-end="134.459">can no one you know you can all do that</span> <span data-start="134.459" data-end="136.709">so that's basically what what Z on this</span> <span data-start="136.709" data-end="142.73">and let's get back to the presentation</span> <span data-start="142.73" data-end="148.709">all right next yeah so what's Yun does</span> <span data-start="148.709" data-end="152.13">is not magic it's it's just a set of</span> <span data-start="152.13" data-end="154.83">rules you get the information from your</span> <span data-start="154.83" data-end="157.08">source you know the structure of the</span> <span data-start="157.08" data-end="159.12">source and so you can apply these rules</span> <span data-start="159.12" data-end="163.29">and for well data from it warnings</span> <span data-start="163.29" data-end="166.29">errors or you know derive tools from</span> <span data-start="166.29" data-end="169.62">them so these rules are applied to the</span> <span data-start="169.62" data-end="172.769">input you get the input rules you apply</span> <span data-start="172.769" data-end="174.209">rules and you get that but that's</span> <span data-start="174.209" data-end="176.25">basically what it works how it works and</span> <span data-start="176.25" data-end="178.11">xeon just you know displays it</span> <span data-start="178.11" data-end="179.79">graphically so it will immediately give</span> <span data-start="179.79" data-end="183.239">you the feedback that you need so the</span> <span data-start="183.239" data-end="185.55">parser works with tokens I'm going to</span> <span data-start="185.55" data-end="187.11">quickly do this actually did this for</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="328.419" data-end="330.13">I call a lead value which is basically</span> <span data-start="330.13" data-end="332.62">just any kind of value like at this or</span> <span

with nothing else so let's have</span> <span data-start="345.4" data-end="348.37">this expression it's a silly expression</span> <span data-start="348.37" data-end="351.31">I know it's still valid

data-start="358.81" data-end="361.6">think so this is these are tokens all</span> <span data-start="361.6" data-end="363.28">right so when the tokenizer is finished</span> <span data-start="363.28" data-end="365.32">with it this is what it ends up with any</span> <span data-start="365.32" data-end="368.02">boxes a single token so we start with</span> <span data-start="368.02"
