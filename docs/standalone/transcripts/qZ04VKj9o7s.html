so just</span> <span data-start="32.92" data-end="37.75">on unwind relax my name is Bernie and</span> <span data-start="37.75" data-end="38.98">we're both software developers at a</span> <span data-start="38.98" data-end="40.899">company called geotab which is based out</span> <span data-start="40.899" data-end="43.45">of Toronto the side of our talk today is</span> <span data-start="43.45" data-end="47.11">called the loader is a lie and whether</span> <span data-start="47.11" data-end="49.21">you hate them or whether you love them</span> <span data-start="49.21" data-end="52.81">we see loaders every day in web pages on</span> <span data-start="52.81" data-end="55.3">our mobile devices you know even when I</span> <span data-start="55.3" data-end="57.28">was at the airport printing

data-start="61.35" data-end="64.149">everywhere</span> <span data-start="64.149" data-end="66.97">anyways the main problem with with</span> <span data-start="66.97" data-end="69.1">loaders is that they're just transparent</span> <span data-start="69.1" data-end="71.979">liars and that's the that's the basis of</span> <span data-start="71.979" data-end="77.2">our talk today so just a quick outline</span> <span data-start="77.2" data-end="79.979">we're gonna go through an introduction</span> <span data-start="79.979" data-end="82.51">the history of loading spinners if you</span> <span data-start="82.51" data-end="83.43">will</span> <span data-start="83.43" data-end="85.42">programs associated the problems</span> <span data-start="85.42" data-end="86.799">associated with them and some</span> <span data-start="86.799" data-end="89.11">improvements that we can make on loading</span> <span data-start="89.11" data-end="91.27">spinners and finally we'll run through a</span> <span data-start="91.27" data-end="98.14">couple demos so before we get into the</span> <span data-start="98.14" data-end="100.24">heart of this talk I just want explain</span> <span data-start="100.24" data-end="103.24">who geotab is and what we do geotab is a</span> <span data-start="103.24" data-end="107.229">telematics or jus top is a global leader</span> <span data-start="107.229" data-end="110.02">in the telematics space for those of you</span> <span data-start="110.02" data-end="112.42">who don't know what telematics is it's</span> <span data-start="112.42" data-end="114.97">the connecting of vehicles so your cars</span> <span data-start="114.97" data-end="118.15">trucks semis etc and reporting where</span> <span data-start="118.15" data-end="121.119">they are and what they're doing we</span> <span data-start="121.119" data-end="122.5">currently have more than 1.2 million</span> <span data-start="122.5" data-end="125.14">vehicles driving around the world every</span> <span data-start="125.14" data-end="128.22">day and those 1.2 million vehicles are</span> <span data-start="128.22" data-end="132.549">generating more than 3 billion raw data</span> <span data-start="132.549" data-end="136.989">records on a on a day to day basis so as</span> <span data-start="136.989" data-end="140.739">you can see from the map we have no</span> <span data-start="140.739" data-end="144.13">shortage of GPS points and I think it's</span> <span data-start="144.13" data-end="144.76">suffice to say</span> <span data-start="144.76" data-end="147.459">we collect a lot of data we also have</span> <span data-start="147.459" data-end="149.56">the richest telematics data set in the</span> <span data-start="149.56" data-end="152.68">world and in addition to GPS we also</span> <span data-start="152.68" data-end="154.959">collect stuff you know such as weather</span> <span data-start="154.959" data-end="156.549">your wipers are going on off weather</span> <span data-start="156.549" data-end="159.069">your seatbelts plugged in whether you're</span> <span data-start="159.069" data-end="163.569">speeding taking corners too sharply or</span> <span data-start="163.569" data-end="164.909">you know breaking through too harshly</span> <span data-start="164.909" data-end="167.11">pretty much anything that the car spits</span> <span data-start="167.11" data-end="169.12">out we are we're ingesting and</span> <span data-start="169.12" data-end="171.19">collecting you can kind of think of us</span> <span data-start="171.19" data-end="172.72">as like big brother for fleets and</span> <span data-start="172.72" data-end="177.42">vehicles but you know in a good way so</span> <span data-start="177.42" data-end="180.43">besides the obvious shameless plug</span> <span data-start="180.43" data-end="182.5">the reason why I mentioning all this is</span> <span data-start="182.5" data-end="184.329">because one of the challenges that we</span> <span data-start="184.329" data-end="187.12">have with all this data is you know</span> <span data-start="187.12" data-end="189.28">taking it in and showing it into a</span> <span data-start="189.28" data-end="191.019">format that people can understand so</span> <span data-start="191.019" data-end="193.06">this could be you know dashboards charts</span> <span data-start="193.06" data-end="196.54">reports etc you know so for instance if</span> <span data-start="196.54" data-end="199.359">we have a chart that's looking at you</span> <span data-start="199.359" data-end="202.239">know several months of data it's a lot</span> <span data-start="202.239" data-end="204.639">of data and the load times can be fairly</span> <span data-start="204.639" data-end="207.909">substantial and you know to alleviate</span> <span data-start="207.909" data-end="210.129">this problem we are guilty of using a</span> <span data-start="210.129" data-end="214.72">loading spinner as well so by show of</span> <span data-start="214.72" data-end="219.819">hands who knows what a throbber is it's</span> <span data-start="219.819" data-end="223.329">the robber okay not many of you as</span> <span data-start="223.329" data-end="225.79">that's kind of I was in the same boat I</span> <span data-start="225.79" data-end="227.56">don't know what if the robber was until</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.56" data-end="229.419">I researched or until I did some</span> <span data-start="229.419" data-end="231.849">research on loading spinners and all</span> <span data-start="231.849" data-end="235.72">their counterparts so a throbber is any</span> <span data-start="235.72" data-end="237.34">animation that a computer program uses</span> <span data-start="237.34" data-end="240.459">to display to the user that work is</span> <span data-start="240.459" data-end="241.66">being done in the background so this</span> <span data-start="241.66" data-end="243.669">would be like downloading or loading a</span> <span data-start="243.669" data-end="245.709">web page or doing some kind of you know</span> <span data-start="245.709" data-end="250.989">some kind of crazy calculation and if</span> <span data-start="250.989" data-end="253.269">you're as old as I am you will recognize</span> <span data-start="253.269" data-end="257.049">these two infamous robbers for those of</span> <span data-start="257.049" data-end="258.849">you don't know the one on the left is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.849" data-end="262.09">Internet Explorer version three and the</span> <span data-start="262.09" data-end="264.33">one on the right is Netscape Navigator</span> <span data-start="264.33" data-end="268.93">both of which are long dead so let's</span> <span data-start="268.93" data-end="270.099">fast forward a few years into the</span> <span data-start="270.099" data-end="274.18">mid-2000s Ajax or when Hejaz was</span> <span data-start="274.18" data-end="276.219">introduced I mean the during a time when</span> <span data-start="276.219" data-end="278.259">most web pages were</span> <span data-start="278.259" data-end="280.61">where most web pages required a full</span> <span data-start="280.61" data-end="283.039">page reload whenever the user did some</span> <span data-start="283.039" data-end="285.8">kind of interaction you know Ajax came</span> <span data-start="285.8" data-end="287.419">in and it wasn't quite the game changer</span> <span data-start="287.419" data-end="289.639">you know it allowed portions of the web</span> <span data-start="289.639" data-end="291.979">page to change dynamically and because</span> <span data-start="291.979" data-end="294.439">of this the robbers kind of came back</span> <span data-start="294.439" data-end="297.139">but were needed more embedded in the</span> <span data-start="297.139" data-end="299.74">site rather than in the browser</span> <span data-start="299.74" data-end="301.729">thankfully the names robbers didn't</span> <span data-start="301.729" data-end="306.069">stick sounds sounds kind of gross I</span> <span data-start="306.069" data-end="309.169">think they're better now known as</span> <span data-start="309.169" data-end="312.77">loading spinners or spinning loaders or</span> <span data-start="312.77" data-end="315.849">progress spinners or what have you</span> <span data-start="315.849" data-end="318.02">but the problem with them was that they</span> <span data-start="318.02" data-end="320.479">were used in judiciously and by that I</span> <span data-start="320.479" data-end="323.12">mean they were used without you know</span> <span data-start="323.12" data-end="325.58">really much any thought whatsoever now</span> <span data-start="325.58" data-end="326.96">pretty much if there was an ajax call</span> <span data-start="326.96" data-end="328.939">you know you could be pretty sure that</span> <span data-start="328.939" data-end="331.279">there was a loading spinner that a</span> <span data-start="331.279" data-end="333.62">company did and i think it's because of</span> <span data-start="333.62" data-end="336.02">this that we've now become quite</span> <span data-start="336.02" data-end="337.819">accustomed to seeing loading spinners</span> <span data-start="337.819" data-end="339.71">you know whatever we're waiting for</span> <span data-start="339.71" data-end="343.529">something over anything to happen right</span> <span data-start="343.539" data-end="347.449">okay let's see how loading spinners look</span> <span data-start="347.449" data-end="353.419">today as you okay this is this is taking</span> <span data-start="353.419" data-end="357.939">longer okay whatever I'll just continue</span> <span data-start="357.939" data-end="360.08">so as you heard from Bernie we are</span> <span data-start="360.08" data-end="361.999">dealing with a lot of data on daily</span> <span data-start="361.999" data-end="365.3">basis a billion strikers per day we are</span> <span data-start="365.3" data-end="366.949">getting data from different data sources</span> <span data-start="366.949" data-end="370.999">like our API or bigquery and it's really</span> <span data-start="370.999" data-end="372.319">challenging to work with those data</span> <span data-start="372.319" data-end="375.199">since we are getting we are having so</span> <span data-start="375.199" data-end="378.559">many so many number of Records of course</span> <span data-start="378.559" data-end="380.87">we are guilty for using loading spinners</span> <span data-start="380.87" data-end="388.279">for fetching those data so sorry for all</span> <span data-start="388.279" data-end="391.939">experience to us those data so we are</span> <span data-start="391.939" data-end="398.3">having so many different I'm sorry of</span> <span data-start="398.3" data-end="398.809">course</span> <span data-start="398.809" data-end="400.159">we are getting for using all the</span> <span data-start="400.159" data-end="402.319">spinners when fashion those data which</span> <span data-start="402.319" data-end="404.629">is unfortunate because some of those</span> <span data-start="404.629" data-end="407.99">queries take so much time they take so</span> <span data-start="407.99" data-end="408.469">long</span> <span data-start="408.469" data-end="409.63">so you</span> <span data-start="409.63" data-end="412.06">are not sure what's happening whether or</span> <span data-start="412.06" data-end="414.37">not it's still loading whether or not</span> <span data-start="414.37" data-end="417.34">they are its deal fetching whether or</span> <span data-start="417.34" data-end="418.99">not they're just staring at some</span> <span data-start="418.99" data-end="422.05">animated gif which is exactly what are</span> <span data-start="422.05" data-end="426.19">you doing now so slides are not broken</span> <span data-start="426.19" data-end="428.56">we are very much connected and online</span> <span data-start="428.56" data-end="432.64">and if I pull at least one of you don't</span> <span data-start="432.64" data-end="434.71">feel bad because this brings us to a</span> <span data-start="434.71" data-end="436.24">first problem with loading spinners</span> <span data-start="436.24" data-end="439">which is that they don't show any sign</span> <span data-start="439" data-end="441.79">of progress the main problem with</span> <span data-start="441.79" data-end="445.29">loading spinners is that they don't show</span> <span data-start="445.29" data-end="448.59">either completed or remaining progress</span> <span data-start="448.59" data-end="452.26">let's go back to the previous loading</span> <span data-start="452.26" data-end="456.19">spinner the 1i tries to fold you it</span> <span data-start="456.19" data-end="462.22">so besides questioning Wi-Fi</span> <span data-start="462.22" data-end="464.83">connectivity here I'm sure at least some</span> <span data-start="464.83" data-end="467.41">of you we're thinking what's happening</span> <span data-start="467.41" data-end="469.95">or how much longer we'll have to wait</span> <span data-start="469.95" data-end="472.42">well the answer on both of those</span> <span data-start="472.42" data-end="476.32">questions is I don't know so you you</span> <span data-start="476.32" data-end="478.6">just accepted the fact that something</span> <span data-start="478.6" data-end="481.09">was happening and that something was</span> <span data-start="481.09" data-end="485.22">going through a lot right so if we</span> <span data-start="485.22" data-end="487.6">replace this loading spinner with some</span> <span data-start="487.6" data-end="492.58">cool animation the user experience might</span> <span data-start="492.58" data-end="496.15">be better but we are still we're still</span> <span data-start="496.15" data-end="498.55">waiting like you are still wondering</span> <span data-start="498.55" data-end="500.74">what's happening and how much longer</span> <span data-start="500.74" data-end="504.13">we'll have to wait the next issue with</span> <span data-start="504.13" data-end="506.62">loading spinners speeders is perception</span> <span data-start="506.62" data-end="509.2">of longer loading time

data-end="1953.71">in a match results which is say like 50</span> <span data-start="1953.71" data-end="1955.54">thousand records and then with that 50</span> <span data-start="1955.54" data-end="1957.46">thousand and we also get a kind of got</span> <span data-start="1957.46" data-end="1959.25">pointer to the to the very last record</span> <span data-start="1959.25" data-end="1962.47">which we use in our subsequent calls to</span> <span data-start="1962.47" data-end="1966.61">get the next 50 thousand and so on and</span> <span data-start="1966.61" data-end="1968.32">then finally a callback just sends back</span> <span data-start="1968.32" data-end="1970.06">the data and the the pointer that I</span> <span data-start="1970.06" data-end="1976">talked about just now so this is just</span> <span data-start="1976" data-end="1978.46">some initialization code for map box</span> <span data-start="1978.46" data-end="1980.62">nothing crazy here I guess the only</span> <span data-start="1980.62" data-end="1983.46">thing I want to point out is that Dec GL</span> <span data-start="1983.46" data-end="1986.11">handles all the interactions instead of</span> <span data-start="1986.11" data-end="1987.81">map box so that's why we have this</span> <span data-start="1987.81" data-end="1993.61">interactive flag set to false so with</span> <span data-start="1993.61" data-end="1997.72">deck GL we start by creating a deck this</span> <span data-start="1997.72" data-end="1999.25">is all pretty pretty simple stuff again</span> <span data-start="1999.25" data-end="2002.55">and as mentioned previously whenever the</span> <span data-start="2002.55" data-end="2005.25">state changes it's handled by this</span> <span data-start="2005.25" data-end="2008.22">function and it keeps both deck GL and</span> <span data-start="2008.22" data-end="2014.67">the map in sync some of our X J's code</span> <span data-start="2014.67" data-end="2018">so we get back data from the Google</span> <span data-start="2018" data-end="2022.86">bigquery API and it's it's putting it to</span> <span data-start="2022.86" data-end="2024.29">an observer or observable</span> <span data-start="2024.29" data-end="2026.82">our observer here we subscribe to it and</span> <span data-start="2026.82" data-end="2029.94">then we're creating a layer that we put</span> <span data-start="2029.94" data-end="2033.51">on to deck GL for our purposes we're</span> <span data-start="2033.51" data-end="2035.73">using a scatter plot layer and we're</span> <span data-start="2035.73" data-end="2036.98">just using the</span> <span data-start="2036.98" data-end="2040.34">we got from bigquery now the data looks</span> <span data-start="2040.34" data-end="2043.4">like this that's pretty simple again</span> <span data-start="2043.4" data-end="2045.32">there's a position which is an array of</span> <span data-start="2045.32" data-end="2049.46">long and lats there's a radius I think</span> <span data-start="2049.46" data-end="2051.74">it's I think it's in pixel but I'm not</span> <span data-start="2051.74" data-end="2053.72">really sure you can also use it you can</span> <span data-start="2053.72" data-end="2056.57">also use a function instead of a number</span> <span data-start="2056.57" data-end="2058.94">and of course we have a color some RGB</span> <span data-start="2058.94" data-end="2064.55">value so that's that's the end of our</span> <span data-start="2064.55" data-end="2069.2">demos and in summary so by no means are</span> <span data-start="2069.2" data-end="2070.97">these what we talked about</span> <span data-start="2070.97" data-end="2073.639">hardened rules for using loading</span> <span data-start="2073.639" data-end="2076.909">spinners or progress spinners but it's</span> <span data-start="2076.909" data-end="2081.5">more it's more for you to consider you</span> <span data-start="2081.5" data-end="2082.7">know that's something to think about the</span> <span data-start="2082.7" data-end="2086.24">next time you're making an async all if</span> <span data-start="2086.24" data-end="2087.28">you're using a loading spinner</span> <span data-start="2087.28" data-end="2091.34">you know just use some good judgment</span> <span data-start="2091.34" data-end="2094.429">for anything else that takes longer if</span> <span data-start="2094.429" data-end="2097.34">you can use a progress spinner or or</span> <span data-start="2097.34" data-end="2098.57">something that at least gives the user</span> <span data-start="2098.57" data-end="2102.05">some kind of feedback right you know if</span> <span data-start="2102.05" data-end="2104.15">you do so your users will probably</span> <span data-start="2104.15" data-end="2107.42">appreciate the the improved loading user</span> <span data-start="2107.42" data-end="2109.46">experience but I think more importantly</span> <span data-start="2109.46" data-end="2110.9">they're going to thank you for not lying</span> <span data-start="2110.9" data-end="2114.619">boldly to your face so that concludes</span> <span data-start="2114.619" data-end="2127.85">our talk thank you guys for listening</span> <span data-start="2127.86" data-end="2130.21">thank you both for that wonderful</span> <span data-start="2130.21" data-end="2132.58">wonderful talk can we get another round</span> <span data-start="2132.58" data-end="2139.42">of applause for both so the next talk is</span> <span data-start="2139.42" data-end="2141.61">going to start at 10:15 unfortunately we</span> <span data-start="2141.61" data-end="2143.29">don't have a spinning loader for the</span> <span data-start="2143.29" data-end="2144.91">next couple minutes so you're just gonna</span> <span data-start="2144.91" data-end="2146.59">have to use the forward progress of time</span> <span data-start="2146.59" data-end="2150.07">as your loader but yeah 10:15 is going</span> <span data-start="2150.07" data-end="2151.54">to be the next talk so have a good</span> <span data-start="2151.54" data-end="2161.59">conversation while you're waiting</span> </p>
