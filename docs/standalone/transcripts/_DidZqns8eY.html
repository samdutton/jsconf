data-end="593.92">callbacks that's all part of the spec so</span> <span data-start="593.92" data-end="596.2">as soon as this tag is read by the</span> <span data-start="596.2"

data-end="616.63">take the Theo rocks tag we can put it on</span> <span data-start="616.63" data-end="619.42">there multiple times Run it now we have</span> <span data-start="619.42" data-end="621.67">an exact duplicate of the Theo rocks tag</span> <span data-start="621.67" data-end="628.6">pretty cool so I actually have a couple</span> <span data-start="628.6" data-end="631.54">examples of this which is great to make</span> <span data-start="631.54" data-end="634.12">it a little bit more useful you know now</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="634.12" data-end="636.25">I'm going to do the Theo rocks tag I'm</span> <span data-start="636.25" data-end="637.87">going to add a source attribute to it</span> <span

data-end="646.6">back I'm going to get the image tag I'm</span> <span data-start="646.6" data-end="648.28">going to set the source equal to the</span> <span data-start="648.28"

like to show off the oh he's a</span> <span data-start="661.84" data-end="669.91">really cute helps a lot and lastly you</span> <span data-start="669.91" data-end="672.1">know this is just showing that custom</span> <span data-start="672.1" data-end="674.17">elements are just like any other HTML</span> <span data-start="674.17" data-end="676.27">elements out there you can add</span> <span
