how do we choose our constraints how</span> <span data-start="688.76" data-end="690.56">do we do this in such a way that we are</span> <span data-start="690.56" data-end="693.08">able to narrow down our search to be</span> <span data-start="693.08" data-end="695.63">able to create these to find these</span> <span data-start="695.63" data-end="698.54">creative ideas from our previous</span> <span data-start="698.54" data-end="701.54">examples you might think oh gosh maybe</span> <span data-start="701.54" data-end="704.27">we should just add a bunch of random</span> <span data-start="704.27" data-end="706.4">constraints and see what happens but</span> <span data-start="706.4" data-end="708.89">that's actually probably not what you</span> <span data-start="708.89" data-end="711.68">want to do so let's take a look at a</span> <span data-start="711.68" data-end="714.59">paint-by-number to paint by number</span> </p>

data-start="719.45" data-end="722.75">constraints 100% the starting place is</span> <span data-start="722.75" data-end="724.46">the burger with a bunch of numbers in it</span> <span data-start="724.46" data-end="728.27">I fill in spaces spaces labeled one with</span> <span data-start="728.27" data-end="731.45">the paint that's labeled 1am and I do</span> <span data-start="731.45" data-end="734.12">the same for two and I do this until all</span> <span data-start="734.12" data-end="739.19">of the areas fill so if you and I both</span> <span data-start="739.19" data-end="741.86">do the same paint by number and we</span> <span data-start="741.86" data-end="744.59">follow the rules because we're rule</span> <span data-start="744.59" data-end="747.38">followers our pieces would come out</span> <span data-start="747.38" data-end="751.67">looking the same a coloring book page is</span> <span data-start="751.67" data-end="754.04">only a slight step up there's still not</span> <span data-start="754.04" data-end="756.58">an awful lot of room for creativity here</span> <span data-start="756.58" data-end="759.2">especially because this is horse</span> <span data-start="759.2" data-end="763.37">skeleton there are constraints that do</span> <span data-start="763.37" data-end="765.83">not promote creativity but instead</span> <span data-start="765.83" data-end="770.66">promote conformity so we need to ensure</span> <span data-start="770.66" data-end="773">that our problem space is actually not</span> <span data-start="773" data-end="775.82">well defined there needs to be some room</span> <span data-start="775.82" data-end="778.31">for the unknown and we also want to</span> <span data-start="778.31" data-end="780.77">choose these constraints strategically</span> <span data-start="780.77" data-end="785.51">if chosen correctly a constraint can</span> <span data-start="785.51" data-end="788">push you towards the goal that's paired</span> <span data-start="788" data-end="792.11">with it for example you want to promote</span> <span data-start="792.11" data-end="793.74">the expansion of real</span> <span data-start="793.74" data-end="797.55">xicon write poetry where every syllable</span> <span data-start="797.55" data-end="799.41">is going to count you have to pick the</span> <span data-start="799.41"

only use black</span> <span data-start="816.81" data-end="823.26">and white for your slides so there's</span> <span data-start="823.26" data-end="827.25">also more common constraints that we're</span> <span data-start="827.25" data-end="828.42">going to find that we're not going to be</span> <span data-start="828.42" data-end="830.64">able to do a lot about for example we</span> <span

data-end="845.13">problem space for you to move around in</span> <span data-start="845.13" data-end="848.4">and it's probably it's probably not</span> <span data-start="848.4" data-end="851.42">going to look as nice and neat as this</span> <span data-start="851.42" data-end="854.88">it's going to be more messy it's going</span> <span data-start="854.88" data-end="858.75">to look maybe more like this your</span> <span data-start="858.75" data-end="861.78">constraints are going to overlap you're</span> <span data-start="861.78" data-end="863.61">going to create some weird spaces a</span> <span data-start="863.61" data-end="865.83">weird framework for you to work inside</span> <span data-start="865.83" data-end="868.92">of maybe after a while that space</span> <span data-start="868.92" data-end="871.65">becomes something that you fully grok a</span> <span data-start="871.65" data-end="873.69">space that you can quickly move around</span> <span data-start="873.69" data-end="875.52">and because you know where all of the</span> <span data-start="875.52" data-end="878.28">boundaries and barriers are in a space</span> <span data-start="878.28" data-end="879.87">where you start making your way into the</span> <span data-start="879.87" data-end="883.59">smaller nukes when you get wedged up</span> <span data-start="883.59" data-end="885.39">into one of those you're going to be</span> <span data-start="885.39" data-end="887.31">coming up with ideas that are generative</span> <span data-start="887.31"

you're going</span> <span data-start="910.11" data-end="914.94">to be turning on creative ideas maybe</span> <span data-start="914.94" data-end="917.88">you begin to identify common constraint</span>
