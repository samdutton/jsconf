<p><span data-start="76.869" data-end="81.1">Audio API then you get the audio input</span> <span data-start="81.1" data-end="83.649">of your computer so I just put the</span> <span data-start="83.649" data-end="86.229">guitar as a microphone basically I</span> <span data-start="86.229" data-end="88.299">connected it to my computer use</span> <span data-start="88.299" data-end="90.759">navigated up

been</span> <span data-start="96.459" data-end="98.619">changed to navigator dot media devices</span> <span data-start="98.619" data-end="101.259">don't get user media but it only works</span> <span

data-start="105.819" data-end="109.99">so for now I use the old version because</span> <span data-start="109.99" data-end="114.009">it's better supported and then basically</span> <span data-start="114.009" data-end="115.81">we're almost done getting the sound of</span> <span data-start="115.81" data-end="118.029">the guitar into the browser all you have</span> <span

data-end="134.47">but basically that's all you have to do</span> <span data-start="134.47" data-end="137.86">to just get the sound of your guitar in</span> <span data-start="137.86" data-end="139.069">your browser and</span> <span data-start="139.069" data-end="143.09">you play guitar on the app step to add</span> <span data-start="143.09" data-end="145.189">effects to the guitar sound because</span> <span data-start="145.189" data-end="147.319">that's what I wanted to do I just wanted</span> <span data-start="147.319" data-end="150.2">to alter the sound you use some effects</span> <span data-start="150.2" data-end="154.04">and make some cool noise basically then</span> <span data-start="154.04" data-end="156.739">you have a few of different pedals which</span> <span data-start="156.739" data-end="159.709">you can find on most pedal boards the</span> <span data-start="159.709" data-end="161.84">most basic one is a volume pedal in</span> <span

data-start="168.439" data-end="170.329">because in the Web Audio API you have</span> <span data-start="170.329" data-end="171.62">something as the gain note which</span> <span data-start="171.62" data-end="174.349">controls the game or just the volume you</span> <span data-start="174.349" data-end="176.689">can create one which is odd with just</span> <span data-start="176.689" data-end="178.459">doing all your context or create game</span> <span data-start="178.459" data-end="181.819">and then set the game which is usually</span> <span data-start="181.819" data-end="184.189">between zero and one or zero percent and</span> <span data-start="184.189" data-end="187.159">1 percent then you connect the input</span> <span data-start="187.159" data-end="188.81">node to the gain nodes we gain out to</span> <span data-start="188.81" data-end="191">the audio context destination and you</span> <span data-start="191" data-end="193.489">have a

signal I have</span> <span data-start="199.909" data-end="204.079">a quick demo of how the gano it effects</span> <span data-start="204.079" data-end="206.629">your audio waves this is just an audio</span> <span data-start="206.629" data-end="210.349">wave of a fixed node but again out of</span> <span data-start="210.349" data-end="214.519">100% so the volume is 100% if you change</span> <span data-start="214.519" data-end="216.319">it to 50 you will see that the waves are</span> <span data-start="216.319" data-end="218.87">getting thinner if you put it bigger you</span> <span data-start="218.87" data-end="220.909">will see the way is get bigger but they</span> <span data-start="220.909" data-end="222.5">get clipped on the top of the top and</span> <span data-start="222.5" data-end="225.079">the bottom that's basically how the gain</span> <span data-start="225.079" data-end="227.84">no it works it just decreases or</span> <span data-start="227.84" data-end="231.65">increases the gain of your signal this</span> <span data-start="231.65" data-end="233.419">is the audio chain I talked about if you</span> <span data-start="233.419" data-end="235.819">just want to put a volume pedal on your</span> <span data-start="235.819" data-end="238.609">guitar sound or on any input sounds this</span> <span data-start="238.609" data-end="240.199">is what you have to do inputs do not</span> <span data-start="240.199" data-end="241.909">gain out outputs</span> <span data-start="241.909" data-end="245.479">done then the second one when you play</span> <span data-start="245.479" data-end="248.9">guitar unless you play country music or</span> <span data-start="248.9" data-end="251.54">so you want to have this little bit</span> <span data-start="251.54" data-end="254.87">gnarly sounding guitar or metal rock</span> <span data-start="254.87" data-end="256.909">whatever doesn't matter you want it to</span> <span data-start="256.909" data-end="259.639">be rough this is usually a distortion</span> <span data-start="259.639" data-end="261.53">pedal or a first pedal or an overdrive</span> <span data-start="261.53" data-end="263.36">pedal does it really matter it's all</span> <span data-start="263.36" data-end="266.78">something that affects the waves of the</span> <span data-start="266.78" data-end="269.51">sound waves in a way that it sounds</span> <span data-start="269.51" data-end="270.65">rough</span> <span data-start="270.65" data-end="272.44">dirty doesn't matter</span> <span

data-end="279.67">note that you can create and you can</span> <span data-start="279.67" data-end="282.76">give it a mouth curve and it will apply</span> <span data-start="282.76"

so there's one very good one on</span> <span data-start="292.86" data-end="294.91">stackoverflow there's a link in my</span> <span data-start="294.91" data-end="297.07">presentation if you want to see
