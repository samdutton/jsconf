<p><span data-start="232.599" data-end="234.31">I don't know what any of this means so</span> <span data-start="234.31" data-end="236.019">we started kind of looking into a deeper</span> <span data-start="236.019" data-end="238.78">so this is totally legit this is off of</span> <span data-start="238.78" data-end="241.51">their manual so you basically take TCP</span> <span data-start="241.51" data-end="243.78">sockets you add some spandex cosmic rays</span> <span data-start="243.78" data-end="247.299">illegal radioscope or yeah radioisotopes</span> <span data-start="247.299" data-end="249.849">from secret soviet atomic city and then</span> <span data-start="249.849" data-end="252.34">that all of that stuff together and you</span> <span data-start="252.34" data-end="255.129">end up with zero and few sockets and</span> <span data-start="255.129" data-end="259.359">really awesome things so essentially the</span> <span data-start="259.359" data-end="261.07">sucks you know the carrier atomic</span> <span data-start="261.07" data-end="264.61">messages across multiple transports like</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="266.38">that's kind of a key here for us as well</span> <span data-start="266.38" data-end="267.82">so you can do it in process</span> <span data-start="267.82" data-end="269.26">inter-process tcp</span> <span data-start="269.26" data-end="276.96">multicast and you can connect sockets</span> <span data-start="276.96" data-end="279.19">well as many of them as you'd like and</span> <span data-start="279.19" data-end="280.81">there's multiple patterns that you can</span> <span data-start="280.81" data-end="283.18">den take advantage of it there's the fan</span> <span data-start="283.18" data-end="285.46">out fan in and I'll talk about that</span> <span data-start="285.46" data-end="288.31">that's part of gorgeous demo we can do</span> <span data-start="288.31" data-end="291.49">pub sub task distribution and then</span> <span data-start="291.49" data-end="294.37">obviously the standard a kind of request</span> <span data-start="294.37" data-end="297.91">response and of course we apply and this</span> <span data-start="297.91" data-end="300.91">is kind of the you know simple I've got</span> <span data-start="300.91" data-end="302.32">some tasks to be done I'm going to send</span> <span data-start="302.32" data-end="304.71">it out there whoever is out in the cloud</span> <span data-start="304.71" data-end="307.06">that's available to do the work we'll</span> <span data-start="307.06" data-end="308.65">just pick it up do what they need to do</span> <span data-start="308.65" data-end="313.39">and come back the pub sub I'm sure all</span> <span data-start="313.39" data-end="315.22">of you are familiar with it within bit</span> <span data-start="315.22" data-end="318.13">hound we use that mainly for all of our</span> <span data-start="318.13" data-end="319.84">stats so we've got all of these</span> <span data-start="319.84" data-end="321.91">distributed nodes you know doing work or</span> <span data-start="321.91" data-end="323.98">being idle or whatever and we want to</span> <span data-start="323.98" data-end="325.87">understand you know what our performance</span> <span data-start="325.87" data-end="327.07">is at the various oh so they all just</span> <span data-start="327.07" data-end="328.96">publish their stats and we've kind of</span> <span data-start="328.96" data-end="330.19">segregated that sits there and listens</span> <span data-start="330.19" data-end="333.79">and you know provide us with our with</span> <span data-start="333.79" data-end="336.43">our stats tooling but this is really</span> <span data-start="336.43" data-end="341.32">where all of our work comes in and this</span> <span data-start="341.32" data-end="343.3">is the fan out and then fan back in so</span> <span data-start="343.3" data-end="346.57">what we do is we have batches of work</span> <span data-start="346.57" data-end="348.01">that need to be done that's so you have</span> <span data-start="348.01" data-end="350.59">a thousand commits that doesn't critics</span> <span data-start="350.59" data-end="354.34">then we need to run we fan those out and</span> <span data-start="354.34" data-end="355.81">you can do that in batches or you can go</span> <span data-start="355.81" data-end="358">to all the once it's up to you we do</span> <span data-start="358" data-end="359.26">ours and batches really to kind of</span> <span data-start="359.26" data-end="362.23">maintain a shallower queue depth so we</span> <span data-start="362.23" data-end="365.14">can better utilize multiple requests for</span> <span data-start="365.14" data-end="368.41">repositories each one of our slaves goes</span> <span data-start="368.41" data-end="370.93">off and does some work and when it's</span> <span data-start="370.93" data-end="372.97">done it kind of response back and we</span> <span data-start="372.97" data-end="375.34">aggregate all of those results and we</span> <span data-start="375.34" data-end="377.43">end up with with what's on our website</span> <span data-start="377.43" data-end="380.38">so that's going to be a quick run</span> <span data-start="380.38" data-end="384.46">through what zeromq is and how we use it</span> <span data-start="384.46" data-end="385.99">and how you can go about doing</span> <span data-start="385.99" data-end="387.25">distributed computing but that was just</span> <span data-start="387.25" data-end="390.04">a theory essentially so we can prep for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="390.04" data-end="392.62">Gords part of the talk so I've gone six</span> <span data-start="392.62" data-end="395.03">minutes so you have an extra four</span> <span data-start="395.03" data-end="398.48">give you nice of course I've prepped for</span> <span data-start="398.48" data-end="401.75">an extra four minutes um so when dan</span> <span data-start="401.75" data-end="405.59">told me we were doing this talk and said</span> <span data-start="405.59" data-end="407.08">you're doing the code portion of</span> <span data-start="407.08" data-end="409.58">distributed computing in JavaScript I</span> <span data-start="409.58" data-end="412.1">thought this is going to be fun so he's</span> <span data-start="412.1" data-end="413.96">like you just need to come up with a</span> <span data-start="413.96" data-end="416.57">really awesome demo and my mind was</span> <span data-start="416.57" data-end="418.55">racing I was like oh I could do like I</span> <span data-start="418.55" data-end="419.75">don't know like what about Fibonacci</span> <span data-start="419.75" data-end="421.52">that's not controversial in the know</span> <span data-start="421.52" data-end="424.51">community but that would be boring so I</span> <span data-start="424.51" data-end="427.67">racked my mind for a long time running</span> <span data-start="427.67" data-end="429.98">different things in it actually the idea</span> <span data-start="429.98" data-end="432.89">for my demo kind of came from a ride</span> <span data-start="432.89" data-end="435.11">with my daughter taking her back from</span> <span data-start="435.11" data-end="437.15">school she was sitting in the back and</span> <span data-start="437.15" data-end="438.86">kind of little conversation is a good</span> <span data-start="438.86" data-end="441.08">time to catch up with your kids and she</span> <span data-start="441.08" data-end="443.9">just randomly asked me daddy how many</span> <span data-start="443.9" data-end="448.88">letters are in 10 and being a incredibly</span> <span data-start="448.88" data-end="454.46">common question I said 3y and so she</span> <span data-start="454.46" data-end="456.5">sits back there and she goes well well</span> <span data-start="456.5" data-end="461.51">if Penn has three letters and three has</span> <span data-start="461.51" data-end="464.6">five letters and then we worked it out</span> <span data-start="464.6" data-end="467.54">okay well five has four letters and four</span> <span data-start="467.54" data-end="472.37">has four letters that works and I was</span> <span data-start="472.37" data-end="476">thinking this is odd so</span> <span data-start="476" data-end="478.4">we we worked we worked out a few more</span> <span data-start="478.4" data-end="479.99">numbers and she's like almost another</span> <span data-start="479.99" data-end="481.67">number i'm like i don't know like 13</span> <span data-start="481.67" data-end="483.8">he's like oh that's a lot of letters and</span> <span data-start="483.8" data-end="486.32">we worked through it and back and forth</span> <span data-start="486.32" data-end="488.03">and they everything kept reducing down</span> <span data-start="488.03" data-end="493.4">to four and this was such a amazing</span> <span data-start="493.4" data-end="497.45">experience like I I had to take a</span> <span data-start="497.45" data-end="498.92">picture of it because it was this</span> <span data-start="498.92" data-end="500.84">serendipitous exchange between me and my</span> <span data-start="500.84" data-end="502.46">daughter where I'm saying they're</span> <span data-start="502.46" data-end="504.47">thinking I have to have a compelling</span> <span data-start="504.47" data-end="506.63">awesome example for distributed</span> <span data-start="506.63" data-end="508.91">processing and here's my daughter</span> <span data-start="508.91" data-end="511.61">sitting in the back doing word games and</span> <span data-start="511.61" data-end="514.46">number games with me so that that is</span> <span data-start="514.46" data-end="516.89">actually my face my mind was blown that</span> <span data-start="516.89" data-end="521.77">that this happened so the key is</span> <span data-start="521.77" data-end="528.5">everything can be reduced to four I'm</span> <span data-start="528.5" data-end="530.9">not I'm not one to preach a religion</span> <span data-start="530.9" data-end="535.91">ought to you but just so you know there</span> <span data-start="535.91" data-end="538.58">is a real livered religion saw on urban</span> <span data-start="538.58" data-end="543.41">dictionary so it's legit called for ism</span> <span data-start="543.41" data-end="546.23">it's a religion based solely on the</span> <span data-start="546.23" data-end="549.86">worship of the ever cool for often</span> <span data-start="549.86" data-end="552.68">involving telling tales and giving of</span> <span data-start="552.68" data-end="555.29">muffins but we're a start-up so you can</span> <span data-start="555.29" data-end="559.49">buy your own muffins so I decided you</span> <span data-start="559.49" data-end="562.22">know what I'm going to create an NPM</span> <span data-start="562.22" data-end="566.87">module called for ism I I created it</span> <span data-start="566.87" data-end="570.14">kind of last week somehow 34 people</span> <span data-start="570.14" data-end="573.26">download it today with without me even</span> <span data-start="573.26" data-end="578.18">telling you about it so kudos I have no</span> <span data-start="578.18" data-end="580.03">idea how people are downloading that but</span> <span data-start="580.03" data-end="583.1">so this is the official launch of for</span> <span data-start="583.1" data-end="586.52">ism for this talk only and don't ever</span> <span data-start="586.52" data-end="589.22">use it so for those of you who know</span> <span data-start="589.22" data-end="591.14">about
