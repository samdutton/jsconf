special</span> <span data-start="158.55" data-end="160.56">maybe you're not special and so there's</span> <span data-start="160.56" data-end="162.06">some like disparity between you and the</span> <span data-start="162.06" data-end="163.8">special people often the people we think</span> <span data-start="163.8" data-end="164.97">who are experts we think there's</span> <span data-start="164.97" data-end="166.89">something very different about them from</span> <span data-start="166.89" data-end="169.83">from where we are and so what I wanted</span> <span data-start="169.83" data-end="171.21">to say is that nobody is born with</span> <span data-start="171.21" data-end="173.49">natural talent there are no natural born</span> <span data-start="173.49" data-end="175.8">programmers and whenever I say this</span> <span data-start="175.8" data-end="177.66">people get really really emotional about</span> <span data-start="177.66" data-end="179.73">this and I mean really emotional</span> <span data-start="179.73" data-end="181.14">probably because their mom told them</span> <span data-start="181.14" data-end="182.67">that they were special or probably</span> <span data-start="182.67" data-end="184.2">because if they are a good programmer</span> <span data-start="184.2" data-end="185.76">they like to pretend that they're</span> <span data-start="185.76" data-end="186.99">special and that there's some natural</span> <span data-start="186.99" data-end="188.88">talent and there's a whole body of</span> <span data-start="188.88" data-end="190.38">research out there you are all smart</span> <span data-start="190.38" data-end="192.03">individuals so I will leave it up to you</span> <span data-start="192.03" data-end="194.19">to to do your own research and take a</span> <span data-start="194.19" data-end="195.84">look there is an interesting book called</span> <span data-start="195.84" data-end="198.87">outliers by I think Malcolm Gladwell I</span> <span data-start="198.87" data-end="200.28">really hope I got that right that</span> <span data-start="200.28" data-end="203.85">discusses this topic at length now you</span> <span data-start="203.85" data-end="205.44">are the results of many complicated</span> <span data-start="205.44" data-end="207.96">interactions some of those things that</span> <span data-start="207.96" data-end="210.51">can make you seem like a natural usually</span> <span data-start="210.51" data-end="213">have to do with your early childhood</span> <span data-start="213" data-end="215.1">education the one thing that people like</span> <span data-start="215.1" data-end="216.9">to glom onto really quickly is genetics</span> <span data-start="216.9" data-end="218.22">and say like oh well you know maybe</span> <span data-start="218.22" data-end="220.5">there's like a gene for programming or a</span> <span data-start="220.5" data-end="222.24">gene for logical thinking and I'm pretty</span> <span data-start="222.24" data-end="223.95">sure that there are probably genes that</span> <span data-start="223.95" data-end="226.02">we can identify I mean I know there's at</span> <span data-start="226.02" data-end="228.26">least a few snps identified for</span> <span data-start="228.26" data-end="230.88">nonverbal intelligence for example but</span> <span data-start="230.88" data-end="232.74">it's not that simple our understanding</span> <span data-start="232.74" data-end="234.3">of genetics has come a long way in the</span> <span data-start="234.3" data-end="237.36">last 10 20 years and really the focus</span> <span data-start="237.36" data-end="239.73">now is on epigenetics the environmental</span> <span data-start="239.73" data-end="240.959">pressures that affect a gene expression</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="242.58">because even if you have like the</span> <span data-start="242.58" data-end="244.77">predisposition to you know unfortunately</span> <span data-start="244.77" data-end="247.08">have cancer you may not necessarily have</span> <span data-start="247.08" data-end="250.17">cancer if you know if you take care of</span> <span data-start="250.17" data-end="251.64">yourself if the environmental pressures</span> <span data-start="251.64" data-end="254.01">aren't there and so that's a little bit</span> <span data-start="254.01" data-end="256.41">nebulous to say that genetics are</span> <span data-start="256.41" data-end="257.64">deterministic because they just they</span> <span data-start="257.64" data-end="259.98">just really aren't also your early</span> <span data-start="259.98" data-end="261.81">childhood exposure to logical thinking</span> <span data-start="261.81" data-end="264.15">whether or not you had that early</span> <span data-start="264.15" data-end="265.83">childhood practice of these logical</span> <span data-start="265.83" data-end="267.78">skills and the early framing of your</span> <span data-start="267.78" data-end="270">relationship to logical thinking a lot</span> <span data-start="270" data-end="271.68">of people like myself who grew up in a</span> <span data-start="271.68" data-end="274.17">fairly all semi rural area and didn't</span> <span data-start="274.17" data-end="276.99">have a lot of positive programmer role</span> <span data-start="276.99" data-end="279.36">models like you know we were sort of</span> <span data-start="279.36" data-end="280.39">pulled that you</span> <span data-start="280.39" data-end="281.5">if you like math and you like</span> <span data-start="281.5" data-end="283.36">programming well that's never gonna go</span> <span data-start="283.36" data-end="284.8">anywhere why do you bother with those</span> <span data-start="284.8" data-end="286.72">computers and some people you know get</span> <span data-start="286.72" data-end="288.52">framed really early that like you know</span> <span data-start="288.52" data-end="290.2">math is gonna be too hard for them or</span> <span data-start="290.2" data-end="291.34">programming is going to be too hard for</span> <span data-start="291.34" data-end="293.2">them well I'm here to tell you today</span> <span data-start="293.2" data-end="296.77">that nobody is a natural and sorry</span> <span data-start="296.77" data-end="297.91">that's just another Jeff about people</span> <span data-start="297.91" data-end="299.89">not liking the logic of it they feel</span> <span data-start="299.89" data-end="302.35">like they're special so your feelings</span> <span data-start="302.35" data-end="304.39">don't matter here in spite of popular</span> <span data-start="304.39" data-end="305.98">beliefs there's no one thing that you're</span> <span data-start="305.98"

data-end="316.06">decision to work through the muck so I</span> <span data-start="316.06" data-end="317.5">wanted to say that yes I mean</span> <span data-start="317.5" data-end="319.45">programming and math and logical</span> <span data-start="319.45" data-end="321.61">thinking can be a hard thing but that</span> <span data-start="321.61" data-end="323.65">every single person in this audience

data-start="327.58" data-end="330.46">there's so much bloody problematic</span> <span data-start="330.46" data-end="332.23">framing of this topic that it drives me</span> <span data-start="332.23" data-end="335.88">up the wall in 2006 Jeff Atwood posted a</span> <span data-start="335.88" data-end="339.31">post I guess he posted he made a post</span> <span data-start="339.31" data-end="342.31">about a academic study and I put that in</span> <span data-start="342.31" data-end="343.99">quotes because while it was put out by a</span> <span data-start="343.99"

data-start="359.71" data-end="362.68">was trying to say was for students that</span> <span data-start="362.68" data-end="364.42">come into our programming courses at our</span> <span

data-end="370.78">how well they're going to do it the</span> <span data-start="370.78" data-end="372.04">course and we can then separate</span> <span data-start="372.04" data-end="374.73">programmers
