<p><span data-start="107.88" data-end="110.22">CSS for color where I show the relevance</span> <span data-start="110.22" data-end="112.62">all of this stuff so the first thing</span> <span data-start="112.62" data-end="117.05">what is that what is this device here a</span> <span data-start="117.05" data-end="122.49">prison right what does a prison do we do</span> <span data-start="122.49" data-end="124.38">flex light and what's the results of</span> <span data-start="124.38" data-end="128.34">that it makes a rainbow right it makes a</span> <span data-start="128.34" data-end="130.019">rainbow ok so we've already established</span> <span data-start="130.019" data-end="131.71">that you already know all about</span> <span data-start="131.71" data-end="132.88">light you know that it's made of</span> <span data-start="132.88" data-end="134.98">different wavelengths and that they go</span> <span data-start="134.98" data-end="136.48">through glass at different speeds and</span> <span data-start="136.48" data-end="138.13">therefore you can turn white light into</span> <span data-start="138.13" data-end="140.8">a rainbow and the white light actually</span> <span data-start="140.8" data-end="142.69">consisted of all those colors originally</span> <span data-start="142.69" data-end="144.37">so this is good we already know</span> <span data-start="144.37" data-end="146.08">something light is the range of</span> <span data-start="146.08" data-end="149.52">wavelengths visible to humans I</span> <span data-start="149.52" data-end="151.75">mentioned humans because like if you're</span> <span data-start="151.75" data-end="153.79">a bumblebee you can see some ultraviolet</span> <span data-start="153.79" data-end="155.47">and if you're a snake you can see some</span> <span data-start="155.47" data-end="157.33">infrared and so on so there's nothing</span> <span data-start="157.33" data-end="159.79">specific about those colors those colors</span> <span data-start="159.79" data-end="162.67">don't exist in nature those colors exist</span> <span data-start="162.67" data-end="165.82">in our brain in our eyes it's a human</span> <span data-start="165.82" data-end="170.5">colors as a human response or at least</span> <span data-start="170.5" data-end="171.79">the colors that we care about we don't</span> <span data-start="171.79" data-end="173.53">actually know much about bumble bees and</span> <span data-start="173.53" data-end="175.57">snakes and how they feel about color so</span> <span data-start="175.57" data-end="178.78">here is a rainbow don't worry about the</span> <span data-start="178.78" data-end="181.12">numbers but it's roughly 380 nanometers</span> <span data-start="181.12" data-end="183.88">to 700 nanometers that's the range of</span> <span data-start="183.88" data-end="185.53">wavelengths that we can see and as you</span> <span data-start="185.53" data-end="187.6">can see we got all the other colors in</span> <span data-start="187.6" data-end="190.8">between so that's the visible spectrum</span> <span data-start="190.8" data-end="193.21">the next thing we need to know is you</span> <span data-start="193.21" data-end="194.86">you have to don't worry about all the</span> <span data-start="194.86" data-end="196.81">labeling here there's only one thing you</span> <span data-start="196.81" data-end="198.97">need to know about which is the retina</span> <span data-start="198.97" data-end="201.01">which is this set of nerve cells at the</span> <span data-start="201.01" data-end="202.99">back the rest of it you can just assume</span> <span data-start="202.99" data-end="204.34">it works and for the purpose of this</span> <span data-start="204.34" data-end="207.88">talk that's it so what's the retina made</span> <span data-start="207.88" data-end="211.86">of well it's made out of these cells</span> <span data-start="211.86" data-end="214.78">these cells and these cells and these</span> <span data-start="214.78" data-end="216.94">cells and then a big black layer at the</span> <span data-start="216.94" data-end="218.92">back which basically stops that like</span> <span data-start="218.92" data-end="220.75">okay the light comes in from here this</span> <span data-start="220.75" data-end="222.37">way due to do goes through all this</span> <span data-start="222.37" data-end="224.41">wiring who designed this stuff goes</span> <span data-start="224.41" data-end="226.24">through all this wiring and then hits a</span> <span data-start="226.24" data-end="228.34">black layer there which it gets absorbed</span> <span data-start="228.34" data-end="232.36">and we've got rods which look roughly</span> <span data-start="232.36" data-end="234.46">rod-like and cones which someone in a</span> <span data-start="234.46" data-end="236.38">fit of imagination looking through a</span> <span data-start="236.38" data-end="240.22">microscope decided with conical ish and</span> <span data-start="240.22" data-end="241.45">then you can see that they have</span> <span data-start="241.45" data-end="243.82">basically connections to these pink</span> <span data-start="243.82" data-end="245.83">cells this one is connected just three</span> <span data-start="245.83" data-end="247.81">of them and this one's connected to one</span> <span data-start="247.81" data-end="250.78">and etc and there's also these blue ones</span> <span data-start="250.78" data-end="253.9">which connect groups up laterally so</span> <span data-start="253.9" data-end="255.28">there's basically think of this as a</span> <span data-start="255.28" data-end="257.32">circuit there's lots of things happening</span> <span data-start="257.32" data-end="260.35">here even before we go on these these</span> <span data-start="260.35" data-end="262.13">these from the optic nerve these</span> <span data-start="262.13" data-end="263.39">out the back of your eye and go after</span> <span data-start="263.39" data-end="266.24">your brain so even before the signals</span> <span data-start="266.24" data-end="268.43">have left the I lots of stuff has</span> <span data-start="268.43" data-end="270.41">happened to them it's actually really</span> <span data-start="270.41" data-end="273.56">complicated there's groups Sarah was</span> <span data-start="273.56" data-end="275.03">talking about animation said that our</span> <span data-start="275.03" data-end="276.71">human visual system is particularly good</span> <span data-start="276.71" data-end="279.35">at detecting motion it is the parts on</span> <span data-start="279.35" data-end="281.96">the outsides of our I a really good at</span> <span data-start="281.96" data-end="283.82">detecting motion really poor at</span> <span data-start="283.82" data-end="286.58">detecting color the bit in the middle is</span> <span data-start="286.58" data-end="288.98">actually it tends to average things over</span> <span data-start="288.98" data-end="291.2">time so you don't notice changes fast</span> <span data-start="291.2" data-end="293.33">but you really precise on little color</span> <span data-start="293.33" data-end="295.7">shifts so we have two completely</span> <span data-start="295.7" data-end="298.22">different visual systems which we use in</span> <span data-start="298.22" data-end="300.35">tandem to build a mental model in our</span> <span data-start="300.35" data-end="304.4">head of what the world is okay great</span> <span data-start="304.4" data-end="307.25">that's fun so let's have a look there</span> <span data-start="307.25" data-end="309.02">are three different types of cones and</span> <span data-start="309.02" data-end="311.99">if you read a bag textbook they'll tell</span> <span data-start="311.99" data-end="313.46">you they're called red green and blue</span> <span data-start="313.46" data-end="317.66">cones no they are not here is the three</span> <span data-start="317.66" data-end="319.85">cones and you can see that this one has</span> <span data-start="319.85" data-end="323.21">its maximum response in yellow this one</span> <span data-start="323.21" data-end="325.58">in yellow green and this one in bluish</span> <span data-start="325.58" data-end="328.73">violet so we'll call them LMK and s or</span> <span data-start="328.73" data-end="331.46">long medium and short wavelengths you</span> <span data-start="331.46" data-end="332.81">can also see that these two are pretty</span> <span data-start="332.81" data-end="335.51">much the same and this one hardly does</span> <span data-start="335.51" data-end="338.42">anything at all so let's look at that on</span> <span data-start="338.42" data-end="341.54">a logarithmic scale now we can see much</span> <span data-start="341.54" data-end="343.1">more yeah these two are definitely</span> <span data-start="343.1" data-end="347.51">almost the same and now if you were</span> <span data-start="347.51" data-end="349.93">building a system if you're building a</span> <span data-start="349.93" data-end="352.31">piece of electronics to measure light</span> <span data-start="352.31" data-end="354.2">you would never design it like this</span> <span data-start="354.2" data-end="355.58">right these two you could probably</span> <span data-start="355.58" data-end="357.26">replace that with just one sensor course</span> <span data-start="357.26" data-end="358.55">they're almost the same you would have</span> <span data-start="358.55" data-end="361.67">you would have nice sauce bandpass</span> <span data-start="361.67" data-end="363.74">functions like this to keep nice no our</span> <span data-start="363.74" data-end="367.22">eyes on like that at all this one in</span> <span data-start="367.22" data-end="368.75">fact all of these three cells have</span> <span data-start="368.75" data-end="370.16">evolved from the same cell they've just</span> <span data-start="370.16" data-end="373.06">diverged and got different sensitivities</span> <span data-start="373.06" data-end="375.5">so we now know that we have these and</span> <span data-start="375.5" data-end="377.12">these do not give us a red green in the</span> <span data-start="377.12" data-end="379.22">blue they're giving us these sorts of</span> <span data-start="379.22" data-end="384.47">strange values then all of that</span> <span data-start="384.47" data-end="387.29">information goes off to the brain to</span> <span data-start="387.29" data-end="388.58">this bit of the bat actually goes</span> <span data-start="388.58" data-end="389.78">through a bit here in the middle which I</span> <span data-start="389.78" data-end="392.03">missed out I never mind that the lateral</span> <span data-start="392.03" data-end="393.56">geniculate nucleus and then we goes to</span> <span data-start="393.56" data-end="395.36">the human visual cortex over there</span> <span data-start="395.36" data-end="396.979">where it we get this entire visual</span> <span data-start="396.979" data-end="400.43">processing happening going on so let's</span> <span data-start="400.43" data-end="402.139">go back from all the complicated things</span> <span data-start="402.139" data-end="403.49">to stuff that you already know about</span> <span data-start="403.49" data-end="405.8">color now what I want you to do is you</span> <span data-start="405.8" data-end="407.71">see the black dots in the middle there</span> <span data-start="407.71" data-end="411.169">and we need to look at that try not to</span> <span data-start="411.169" data-end="412.969">let your eyes move and I want you to</span> <span data-start="412.969" data-end="416.02">look at that for about 15 or 20 seconds</span> <span data-start="416.02" data-end="418.43">just keep looking at it don't let your I</span> <span data-start="418.43" data-end="421.49">track around just keep fixing looking at</span> <span data-start="421.49" data-end="432.379">that same black dot 15 20 ish do you see</span> <span data-start="432.379" data-end="437.479">anything green right that's weird that's</span> <span data-start="437.479" data-end="439.55">a white slide completely white slide</span> <span data-start="439.55" data-end="441.74">with the dot let's do that one again Oh</span> <span data-start="441.74" data-end="444.379">different colors time so look at the</span> <span data-start="444.379" data-end="447.11">black dot trinocular eyes move just keep</span> <span data-start="447.11" data-end="456.089">looking at the black dot 10 seconds 15</span> <span data-start="456.099" data-end="463.819">20 oh yes so these are called opponent</span> <span data-start="463.819" data-end="466.37">colors why are we seeing this what</span> <span data-start="466.37" data-end="469.639">actually happened is the the rods that</span> <span data-start="469.639" data-end="471.199">sort of the cones in your eyes use a</span> <span data-start="471.199" data-end="473.3">particular pigment which absorbs light</span> <span data-start="473.3" data-end="476.96">and over time if it keeps getting the</span> <span data-start="476.96" data-end="479.06">same input it kind of bleaches out he</span> <span data-start="479.06" data-end="481.37">gets tired and then if I suddenly switch</span> <span data-start="481.37" data-end="483.409">to white you'll see basically the</span> <span data-start="483.409" data-end="485.27">inverse of that you'll see the opponent</span> <span data-start="485.27" data-end="487.46">thing what this tells us is that all</span> <span data-start="487.46" data-end="488.81">those nerves what they're doing is</span> <span data-start="488.81" data-end="491.06">they're producing opponent colors colors</span> <span data-start="491.06" data-end="492.74">which are opposites of each other and</span> <span data-start="492.74" data-end="493.939">we're very good at detecting changes</span> <span data-start="493.939" data-end="496.069">where something changes to its opposite</span> <span data-start="496.069" data-end="499.639">color and you'll see the relevance of</span> <span data-start="499.639" data-end="503.27">this later on when I get onto la be next</span> <span data-start="503.27" data-end="505.789">thing you need to know what what color</span> <span data-start="505.789" data-end="511.759">is this yellow right it's a piece of</span> <span data-start="511.759" data-end="514.37">white paper which I took a photograph of</span> <span data-start="514.37" data-end="516.829">in a hotel room but I switched off the</span> <span data-start="516.829" data-end="518.599">auto white balancing on the camera so it</span> <span data-start="518.599" data-end="520.909">came out as yellow and if I have to do</span> <span data-start="520.909" data-end="522.409">the same thing outside it would come out</span> <span data-start="522.409" data-end="524.51">as light blue but if you are with me in</span> <span data-start="524.51" data-end="525.45">the room looking</span> <span data-start="525.45" data-end="526.98">that you and I look at it and say this</span> <span data-start="526.98" data-end="533.46">is white why because we evolved to be in</span> <span data-start="533.46" data-end="535.05">a constantly changing visual environment</span> <span data-start="535.05" data-end="537.96">the Sun goes behind a cloud and it
