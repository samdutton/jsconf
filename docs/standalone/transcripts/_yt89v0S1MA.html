we</span> <span data-start="164.319" data-end="166.45">need first of all create an audio</span> <span data-start="166.45" data-end="169.93">context so we create in our audio</span> <span

actually</span> <span data-start="282.48" data-end="286.71">means our volume how loud our sound so</span> <span data-start="286.71" data-end="288.96">to reduce sound we need to divide by 2</span> <span data-start="288.96" data-end="292.65">to increase sound we need to multiply by</span> <span data-start="292.65" data-end="297.11">some number so house looks in cold</span> <span

set up zero will mean our sound</span> <span data-start="316.74" data-end="321.18">will be muted one is it's normal and if</span> <span data-start="321.18" data-end="323.82">it's higher than 1 it will be louder</span> <span data-start="323.82" data-end="327.99">than original input next we need to</span> <span data-start="327.99" data-end="330.51">build this graph so we have our source</span> <span

data-start="422.68" data-end="428.5">[Music]</span> <span data-start="428.5" data-end="431.87">so yeah it was the basic stuff actually</span> <span data-start="431.87" data-end="434.449">as this manager I wrote myself some time</span> <span data-start="434.449" data-end="443.24">ago so okay the first effect I want to</span> <span data-start="443.24" data-end="446.449">show is this social so you can't imagine</span> <span data-start="446.449" data-end="448.879">any rock music without distortion sound</span> <span data-start="448.879" data-end="452.81">and basically what is this ocean it's a</span> <span data-start="452.81" data-end="455.629">group of effects that shaping our way</span> <span data-start="455.629" data-end="460.159">input sound with some function so what</span> <span data-start="460.159" data-end="462.53">is this group of effects we have few of</span> <span data-start="462.53" data-end="465.59">them overdrive distortion and fools and</span> <span data-start="465.59" data-end="470">all of them still called fools I want to</span> <span data-start="470" data-end="475.52">tell sorry how it was invented so in the</span> <span data-start="475.52" data-end="479.15">past the amplifiers wasn't that good as</span> <span data-start="479.15" data-end="481.4">they are now and they were broken</span> <span data-start="481.4" data-end="485.449">sometime so who if speaker was broken is</span> <span data-start="485.449" data-end="490.849">that to produce disordered sound so some</span> <span data-start="490.849" data-end="494">people started to distil destroy their</span> <span data-start="494" data-end="496.43">amplifiers themselves to get this sound</span> <span data-start="496.43" data-end="499.34">before it was done by some transitions</span> <span data-start="499.34" data-end="502.88">and so on now you don't need to do that</span> <span data-start="502.88" data-end="508.43">you can just use Web Audio for that yeah</span> <span data-start="508.43" data-end="513.68">don't destroy speakers so how its look</span> <span data-start="513.68" data-end="515.57">like again we have any input that's</span> <span data-start="515.57" data-end="519.409">actually a say a sine wave yes and we</span> <span data-start="519.409" data-end="522.2">apply some function to it to make it</span> <span data-start="522.2" data-end="526.79">more square so this mu squared sound</span> <span data-start="526.79" data-end="530.24">gives out our sound to be disordered for</span> <span data-start="530.24" data-end="532.31">example we can apply that function that</span> <span data-start="532.31" data-end="534.86">is here but what's the difference</span> <span data-start="534.86" data-end="539.209">between overdrive distortion and food so</span> <span data-start="539.209" data-end="542.06">the difference is how smooth is that</span> <span data-start="542.06" data-end="546.37">curve overdrive is usually something</span> <span data-start="546.37" data-end="550.27">lamp based so it's more smooth curve</span> <span data-start="550.27" data-end="553.1">distortions have some more harder one</span> <span data-start="553.1" data-end="555.44">and fools basically sounds like</span> <span data-start="555.44" data-end="559.52">something ditional it's almost flat sine</span> <span data-start="559.52" data-end="561.11">wave</span> <span data-start="561.11" data-end="567.51">so to shape our input in way we want it</span> <span data-start="567.51" data-end="570.81">we can use wave shape or node we can</span> <span data-start="570.81" data-end="575.43">create in and apply a curve and curve is</span> <span data-start="575.43"
