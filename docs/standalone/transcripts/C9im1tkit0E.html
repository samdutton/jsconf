a range of</span> <span data-start="229.769" data-end="231.359">emotions and by understanding emotions</span> <span data-start="231.359" data-end="235.049">in others we then relate to them

data-start="242.22" data-end="244.609">emotion actually has three components</span> <span data-start="244.609" data-end="248.01">these are physiological changes such as</span> <span

data-end="289.169">those animated worlds and we often</span> <span data-start="289.169" data-end="294.539">escape into them as well studio ghibli</span> <span data-start="294.539" data-end="298.199">to me show mastery in each of their</span> <span data-start="298.199" data-end="300.09">films as far as bringing a sense of</span> <span data-start="300.09" data-end="302.91">delight goes this is actually an advert</span> <span data-start="302.91" data-end="305.25">they did so this cat we can relate to</span> <span data-start="305.25" data-end="307.889">because it's beyond cute right there's a</span> <span data-start="307.889" data-end="310.02">sense of delight in its playful batting</span> <span data-start="310.02" data-end="312.539">of the butterfly it's delightful to</span> <span data-start="312.539" data-end="318.03">watch and it fills you with joy well</span> <span data-start="318.03" data-end="321.18">mrs. a complete contrast the web it's</span> <span data-start="321.18" data-end="323.22">never been very good over late interest</span> <span data-start="323.22" data-end="328.259">as a human interactions often cold clin</span> <span data-start="328.259" data-end="330.78">clinical because it's not actually a</span> <span data-start="330.78" data-end="334.949">pixar film and it has in the past felt</span> <span data-start="334.949" data-end="336.539">like the web was created for robots</span> <span data-start="336.539" data-end="341.34">rather than humans when you only have an</span> <span data-start="341.34" data-end="344.27">interface how do you actually show</span> <span data-start="344.27" data-end="348.65">emotion animation takes advantage of</span> <span data-start="348.65" data-end="351.81">facial features because robots even have</span> <span data-start="351.81" data-end="354.449">them right we show our motion on our</span> <span data-start="354.449" data-end="357.3">faces but what happens when you have no</span> <span data-start="357.3" data-end="363.03">face so anime and manga actually have a</span> <span data-start="363.03" data-end="365.43">unique visual language that conveys</span> <span data-start="365.43" data-end="368.58">character emotion and these range from</span> <span data-start="368.58" data-end="370.47">speed lines to cryin and something at</span> <span data-start="370.47" data-end="372.419">racal cat mouths it's a bit of an aside</span> <span data-start="372.419" data-end="373.889">but i'd like to share this with you a</span> <span data-start="373.889" data-end="376.02">cat mouth is actually when a mouth gross</span> <span data-start="376.02" data-end="378.419">finds and looks like a cat and what it</span> <span data-start="378.419" data-end="381.949">means is the character is feeling catty</span> <span data-start="381.949" data-end="385.229">so it adds a nerve element beyond the</span> <span data-start="385.229" data-end="388.199">facial expression to the animation and</span> <span data-start="388.199" data-end="391.55">to us our understanding of the character</span> <span data-start="391.55" data-end="394.62">so a lot of you probably know the book</span> <span data-start="394.62" data-end="396.029">by disney called the illusion of life</span> <span data-start="396.029" data-end="398.02">disney animation</span> <span data-start="398.02" data-end="400.24">and in that it set trial basic</span> <span data-start="400.24" data-end="403.9">principles of animation and these kind</span> <span data-start="403.9" data-end="406.21">of create illusion that the object</span> <span data-start="406.21" data-end="408.819">adheres to the laws of physics but it</span> <span data-start="408.819" data-end="411.22">actually goes beyond that too emotional</span> <span data-start="411.22" data-end="414.4">timing and character appeal and I feel</span> <span data-start="414.4" data-end="415.78">when dealing with motion we can probably</span> <span data-start="415.78" data-end="418.18">deal this kind of reduce the 12 down to</span> <span data-start="418.18" data-end="421.11">four and those i'd like to share to that</span> <span data-start="421.11" data-end="423.039">so the first of these would be</span> <span data-start="423.039" data-end="427.599">anticipation anticipation prepares for</span> <span data-start="427.599" data-end="430.69">an action this also focuses attention on</span> <span data-start="430.69" data-end="433.599">an object this could be really useful to</span> <span data-start="433.599" data-end="436.33">show a start of an emotional response or</span> <span data-start="436.33" data-end="440.139">arresting emotion and then we have</span> <span data-start="440.139" data-end="441.849">timing and this is critical for</span> <span data-start="441.849" data-end="444.37">conveying emotions and different</span> <span data-start="444.37" data-end="446.53">emotions have different times as well it</span> <span data-start="446.53" data-end="448.03">really can convey the character's</span> <span data-start="448.03" data-end="451.539">personality and then we have</span> <span data-start="451.539" data-end="454.449">exaggeration this is a little bit of a</span> <span data-start="454.449" data-end="456.46">double-edged sword because it can be a</span> <span data-start="456.46" data-end="458.349">technique that's actually overused but</span> <span data-start="458.349" data-end="460.419">where motion is concerned some are</span> <span data-start="460.419" data-end="463.449">actually exaggerated and this is one</span> <span data-start="463.449" data-end="464.68">that you can really play around with and</span> <span data-start="464.68" data-end="466.81">create an emotion in a static element</span> <span data-start="466.81" data-end="469.419">and then you have appeal which is</span> <span data-start="469.419" data-end="472.33">essential for motion we have to find</span> <span data-start="472.33" data-end="474.46">something appealing so this is kind of</span> <span data-start="474.46" data-end="477.4">if you ever played a kind of D&D this</span> <span data-start="477.4" data-end="480.13">was your charisma kind of amount in that</span> <span data-start="480.13" data-end="482.59">so we have less of this then you</span> <span data-start="482.59" data-end="484.389">wouldn't simplify so in Disney terms</span> <span data-start="484.389" data-end="485.83">this would be kind of the villain you</span> <span data-start="485.83" data-end="486.969">wouldn't want to sympathize with the</span> <span data-start="486.969" data-end="488.979">villain and this is also seen as a</span> <span data-start="488.979" data-end="494.039">captivation of a character summation</span> <span data-start="494.039" data-end="498.099">experiences connect with the user they</span> <span data-start="498.099" data-end="502.3">bring moments of delight an interface</span> <span data-start="502.3" data-end="504.4">can touch you as you interact with it</span> <span data-start="504.4" data-end="506.56">and when you do that you actually create</span> <span data-start="506.56" data-end="509.65">a meaningful in connection and that's</span> <span data-start="509.65" data-end="514.089">priceless this is how your users become</span> <span data-start="514.089" data-end="517.36">really really

data-end="923.7">bring that into my button so I started</span> <span data-start="923.7" data-end="925.65">to think how the keyframes would look</span> <span data-start="925.65" data-end="927.51">and I did some really rough graphs</span> <span data-start="927.51" data-end="929.92">however this was me just time</span> <span data-start="929.92" data-end="932.26">think how it would kind of peak and</span> <span data-start="932.26" data-end="935.769">trough so I kind of thought the happy</span> <span data-start="935.769" data-end="937.72">button would actually be keen to be used</span> <span

data-end="948.16">actually react on load imagine it'd kind</span> <span data-start="948.16" data-end="949.93">of be so happy it just couldn't help</span> <span data-start="949.93" data-end="952.12">itself so little happiness blips were</span> <span data-start="952.12" data-end="953.74">escaping and then when you actually</span> <span data-start="953.74" data-end="955.93">interacted with it it will get even</span> <span data-start="955.93" data-end="960.1">happier so this is a happy button it's</span> <span data-start="960.1" data-end="962.44">kind of just kind of doing a little and</span> <span data-start="962.44" data-end="964.959">then when you interact with it it just</span> <span data-start="964.959" data-end="967.6">cannot escape so this is my version of a</span> <span data-start="967.6" data-end="972.37">minions in a bun so then I went back to</span> <span data-start="972.37" data-end="975.67">look at angry and I started think about</span> <span data-start="975.67" data-end="978.639">how the angry button would appear and i</span> <span data-start="978.639" data-end="980.44">found this animated gif and you can see</span> <span data-start="980.44" data-end="984.339">the rock side by side of sheer anger and</span> <span data-start="984.339" data-end="985.57">i thought this would be good to reflect</span> <span

data-end="993.37">movement so i went back to drawing rough</span> <span data-start="993.37" data-end="997.329">graphs and i kind of thought that I</span> <span data-start="997.329" data-end="999.399">wanted to attach a personality this time</span> <span data-start="999.399" data-end="1001.589">to its button beyond just kind of the</span> <span data-start="1001.589" data-end="1004.14">minion I wanted to actually make you</span> <span data-start="1004.14" data-end="1006.39">feel that there was a kind of a girl and</span> <span data-start="1006.39" data-end="1009">a violent shaking so I actually thought</span> <span data-start="1009" data-end="1010.68">it would be a little bit like poking</span> <span data-start="1010.68" data-end="1013.199">someone awake so it'd kind of be all</span> <span data-start="1013.199" data-end="1015.72">quiet and then it'd kind of be a girl</span> <span data-start="1015.72" data-end="1017.82">get off is what I wanted this the kind</span> <span data-start="1017.82" data-end="1019.62">of anger so you kind of get that feeling</span> <span data-start="1019.62" data-end="1023.13">and this is what I had with angry button</span> <span data-start="1023.13" data-end="1026.4">so you interact to kind of get off and</span> <span data-start="1026.4" data-end="1030.209">it kind of gives that feedback and then</span> <span data-start="1030.209" data-end="1034.29">it kind of a second so sad but and I</span> <span data-start="1034.29" data-end="1035.85">knew just going to be a bit of a</span> <span data-start="1035.85" data-end="1039">challenge because sadness is quite a</span> <span data-start="1039" data-end="1041.16">wide range and it's quite hard to convey</span> <span data-start="1041.16" data-end="1044.309">and one person sad really isn't another</span> <span data-start="1044.309" data-end="1048.419">person's sadness I did a bit of search</span> <span data-start="1048.419" data-end="1051.65">and I found this heartbreaking Pikachu</span> <span data-start="1051.65" data-end="1054.21">this kind of all the sad I can't

data-end="1067.2">so I then thought about how that I would</span> <span data-start="1067.2" data-end="1069.45">actually look in a graph and it's kind</span> <span data-start="1069.45" data-end="1070.89">of quite you can see the difference in</span> <span data-start="1070.89" data-end="1073.11">the emotion in the grass I'm creating</span> <span data-start="1073.11" data-end="1075.87">and I thought this is kind of be a</span> <span data-start="1075.87" data-end="1077.76">reluctant button and I cited think of</span> <span data-start="1077.76" data-end="1080.88">how it'd almost be that sad sighing and</span> <span data-start="1080.88" data-end="1083.16">this would be on click and it would be</span> <span data-start="1083.16" data-end="1084.48">kind of reluctant there would be this</span> <span data-start="1084.48" data-end="1086.37">kind of time delay when we're going back</span> <span data-start="1086.37"

data-end="1095.49">actually really sad it's actually quite</span> <span data-start="1095.49" data-end="1099.36">a slight emotion but you interact its</span> <span data-start="1099.36" data-end="1103.52">kind of that's what the button does so I</span> <span data-start="1103.52" data-end="1107.16">then went on to test on some humans I</span> <span data-start="1107.16" data-end="1110.49">did five initial 121 test because I just</span> <span data-start="1110.49" data-end="1112.2">wanted to see whether i was crazy</span> <span data-start="1112.2"
