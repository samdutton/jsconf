<p><span data-start="153.209" data-end="155.25">Jan Kaas to will cause your animations</span> <span data-start="155.25" data-end="157.35">to slow down it will cause quite a lot</span> <span data-start="157.35" data-end="162.019">of performance issues or it could so why</span> <span data-start="162.019" data-end="164.58">why go beyond transitions what's wrong</span> <span data-start="164.58" data-end="167.31">with transitions then this is my</span> <span data-start="167.31" data-end="172.26">favorite slide okay so and we just look</span> <span data-start="172.26" data-end="173.58">at a couple of transitions now some of</span> <span data-start="173.58" data-end="175.41">them are fairly simple this is probably</span> <span data-start="175.41" data-end="177.15">things you've done before so as we hover</span> <span data-start="177.15" data-end="180.68">over here and we change the color and</span> <span data-start="180.68" data-end="183.12">then on this next one when we hover over</span> <span data-start="183.12" data-end="185.91">it it changes to an X so you can see</span> <span data-start="185.91" data-end="188.43">there the the transition code itself is</span> <span data-start="188.43" data-end="190.709">just stroke 250 milliseconds and then</span> <span data-start="190.709" data-end="192.9">we're going to apply a timing function</span> <span data-start="192.9" data-end="195.09">of easing out and then same for this one</span> <span data-start="195.09" data-end="196.68">except we're going to animate all of the</span> <span data-start="196.68" data-end="200.22">properties not just the color and then</span> <span data-start="200.22" data-end="202.56">magic happens because it's not quite</span> <span data-start="202.56" data-end="203.88">that simple you still gotta tell it when</span> <span data-start="203.88" data-end="207.66">and what to animate so here that menu</span> <span data-start="207.66" data-end="209.79">turn it into a cross is made up of four</span> <span data-start="209.79" data-end="213.269">lines so the the middle bit is two lines</span> <span data-start="213.269" data-end="215.1">stacked on top of each other so then</span> <span data-start="215.1" data-end="217.59">when we hover over we hide the top and</span> <span data-start="217.59" data-end="219.81">bottom lines and then transform the</span> <span data-start="219.81" data-end="225.849">middle lines out over to Korea across</span> <span data-start="225.859" data-end="230.01">simple issue so one more quick example</span> <span data-start="230.01" data-end="232.23">and so these are just some cards that</span> <span data-start="232.23" data-end="233.549">you might have on any typical website</span> <span data-start="233.549" data-end="235.68">and the bottom corner is going to be</span> <span data-start="235.68" data-end="239.13">used to to show a category or to show a</span> <span data-start="239.13" data-end="242.04">name or something like that and as we</span> <span data-start="242.04" data-end="244.89">hover over that's revealed so again this</span> <span data-start="244.89" data-end="247.41">is using transitions now animation so</span> <span data-start="247.41" data-end="252.06">upon hover we're going to change the</span> <span data-start="252.06" data-end="253.53">border width of the after and the</span> <span data-start="253.53" data-end="256.709">opacity of the before so the after is</span> <span data-start="256.709" data-end="259.2">the the rectangular corner and the</span> <span data-start="259.2" data-end="263.94">before is the text so it's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="263.94" data-end="266.7">so transitions are awesome but limited</span> <span data-start="266.7" data-end="267.81">we can only animate from</span> <span data-start="267.81" data-end="269.58">value to another and we require some</span> <span data-start="269.58" data-end="271.56">sort of interaction in order for it to</span> <span data-start="271.56" data-end="274.08">fire so this is why we're going to go</span> <span data-start="274.08" data-end="280.53">beyond transitions so none of this is is</span> <span data-start="280.53" data-end="282.51">exactly new CSS animations have been</span> <span data-start="282.51" data-end="284.82">around forever so why am i standing on a</span> <span data-start="284.82" data-end="286.79">stage in 2019 talking to you about it</span> <span data-start="286.79" data-end="289.05">because it just feels them to use it</span> <span data-start="289.05" data-end="291.45">feels since since Apple went and killed</span> <span data-start="291.45" data-end="293.7">flash the the animations taken a bit of</span> <span data-start="293.7" data-end="295.23">a backseat on the web no one seems to</span> <span data-start="295.23" data-end="296.85">really be doing much with it there's a</span> <span data-start="296.85" data-end="297.99">couple of websites where you're like oh</span> <span data-start="297.99" data-end="300.03">that's cool but that's kind of about it</span> <span data-start="300.03" data-end="302.82">whereas we've got this tool in in CSS</span> <span data-start="302.82" data-end="305.7">that has quite a simple syntax you can</span> <span data-start="305.7" data-end="307.77">do so much with it and we can bring the</span> <span data-start="307.77" data-end="310.2">web to life again like it was back</span> <span data-start="310.2" data-end="315.06">before Apple okay so I'm gonna stop</span> <span data-start="315.06" data-end="316.71">complaining now and inspire and said or</span> <span data-start="316.71" data-end="318.24">at least try so this is the first</span> <span data-start="318.24" data-end="319.41">animation we're going to look at and</span> <span data-start="319.41" data-end="321.12">it's a simple scrolling Mouse you've</span> <span data-start="321.12" data-end="322.29">probably seen something like this they</span> <span data-start="322.29" data-end="324">usually sit at the bottom of like a hero</span> <span data-start="324" data-end="325.919">area or something just to indicate to</span> <span data-start="325.919" data-end="329.22">the user that you can scroll down so how</span> <span data-start="329.22" data-end="330">does it work</span> <span data-start="330" data-end="332.88">so this animation is made up of an SVG</span> <span data-start="332.88" data-end="334.77">and just two elements inside there</span> <span data-start="334.77" data-end="336.57">there's a rectangle in a circle and</span> <span data-start="336.57" data-end="339.63">we've given them both a class name so</span> <span data-start="339.63" data-end="341.49">the first thing to do is to style the</span> <span data-start="341.49" data-end="344.16">the elements within our SVG so we're</span> <span data-start="344.16" data-end="345.87">just going to give a stroke color and</span> <span data-start="345.87" data-end="348.33">width a fill color and an opacity for</span> <span data-start="348.33" data-end="351.03">the the actual scroll and then we can</span> <span data-start="351.03" data-end="353.91">see we've managed to style our style our</span> <span data-start="353.91" data-end="356.639">mouse then we can move once we've got</span> <span data-start="356.639" data-end="357.84">our styling we can move on to the</span> <span data-start="357.84" data-end="360.93">animation so here we're saying we have a</span> <span data-start="360.93" data-end="362.7">keyframe animation called scroll and</span> <span data-start="362.7" data-end="366.06">from 0 to 20% we're not going to do</span> <span data-start="366.06" data-end="369">anything and then from 20% to 100% we're</span> <span data-start="369" data-end="371.88">going to move along the y-axis 36 pixels</span> <span data-start="371.88" data-end="374.039">and then we're also going to elongate</span> <span data-start="374.039" data-end="376.11">the shape which is by stretching it</span> <span data-start="376.11" data-end="378.479">along the y-axis using scale Y and then</span> <span data-start="378.479" data-end="381.24">we're also going to fade it out so now</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="382.86">we've created our animation we need to</span> <span data-start="382.86" data-end="385.26">set that so we give it an animation name</span> <span data-start="385.26" data-end="389.4">duration and an inspiration count and it</span> <span data-start="389.4" data-end="394.65">didn't work so why didn't it work so we</span> <span data-start="394.65" data-end="395.76">were missing the transform origin</span> <span data-start="395.76" data-end="398.789">property so this is quite important when</span> <span data-start="398.789" data-end="400.47">you're animating especially with SVG and</span> <span data-start="400.47" data-end="401.8">things like that because then not</span> <span data-start="401.8" data-end="403.99">using the regular Dom they have their</span> <span data-start="403.99" data-end="408.85">own Dom separate to HTML one so here</span> <span data-start="408.85" data-end="410.74">we're saying we're going to transform</span> <span data-start="410.74" data-end="413.71">from the center and from 20 pixels and</span> <span data-start="413.71" data-end="415.479">then once we've applied that we can see</span> <span data-start="415.479" data-end="417.31">it's starting to move down over where it</span> <span data-start="417.31" data-end="418.75">was kind of just stretched on the spot</span> <span data-start="418.75" data-end="423.61">before so it's nearly what we had as the</span> <span data-start="423.61" data-end="425.41">example but not quite so he's the two</span> <span data-start="425.41" data-end="427.389">side-by-side the one on the Left sort of</span> <span data-start="427.389" data-end="429.22">dropping down and stretching and the one</span> <span data-start="429.22" data-end="431.77">on the right is what we're aiming for so</span> <span data-start="431.77" data-end="433.15">without going back and changing our</span> <span data-start="433.15" data-end="435.699">animation we can accomplish that with</span> <span data-start="435.699" data-end="437.62">one line of code so here we're just</span> <span data-start="437.62" data-end="439.539">using the animation timing function and</span> <span data-start="439.539" data-end="442.09">we're using cubic Bezier instead of one</span> <span data-start="442.09" data-end="444.13">of the preset values like linear or ease</span> <span data-start="444.13" data-end="446.31">in or ease out or anything like that and</span> <span data-start="446.31" data-end="448.78">but cubic Bezier just allows you to add</span> <span data-start="448.78" data-end="451.599">custom functions and the numbers look</span> <span data-start="451.599" data-end="452.979">horrible but don't worry about that this</span> <span data-start="452.979" data-end="454.36">generator isn't all that sort of thing</span> <span data-start="454.36" data-end="455.44">out there so you can go and have a play</span> <span data-start="455.44" data-end="458.289">and see what looks good what doesn't and</span> <span data-start="458.289" data-end="460.72">what you're aiming for so then when we</span> <span data-start="460.72" data-end="462.55">apply that you can see we now sort of</span> <span data-start="462.55" data-end="464.139">have that nice or particular little as</span> <span data-start="464.139" data-end="466.21">itself goes up and then comes down again</span> <span data-start="466.21" data-end="471.01">so in less than two three minutes of</span> <span data-start="471.01" data-end="472.81">talking we've gone from completely</span> <span data-start="472.81" data-end="478.81">installed SVG to a finished animation so</span> <span data-start="478.81" data-end="479.83">it's no bad but you've probably seen</span> <span data-start="479.83" data-end="482.229">something like that before let's see if</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="482.229" data-end="489.46">I can really impress you this time so</span> <span data-start="489.46" data-end="491.38">this animation is created entirely with</span> <span data-start="491.38" data-end="497.48">SVG and CSS</span> <span data-start="497.49" data-end="503.08">so how did I do it so the the key to</span> <span data-start="503.08" data-end="506.25">this is the the animation steps function</span> <span data-start="506.25" data-end="508.87">we'll come back to that in a moment but</span> <span data-start="508.87" data-end="510.73">that's really the key to what's</span> <span data-start="510.73" data-end="514.3">happening here so step one for creating</span> <span data-start="514.3" data-end="515.62">this animation was creating the image</span> <span data-start="515.62" data-end="518.14">itself so start by drawing one of the</span> <span data-start="518.14" data-end="521.56">poses as a vector I think I used sketch</span> <span data-start="521.56" data-end="523.18">but you can use whatever you want and</span> <span data-start="523.18" data-end="525.46">then you go ahead and draw the remaining</span> <span data-start="525.46" data-end="528.67">poses in my case that ended up being ten</span> <span data-start="528.67" data-end="530.95">and that was because it was a time</span> <span data-start="530.95"

those lovely sort of pop-up circles</span> <span data-start="897.22" data-end="903.46">around it so how did we do that again we</span> <span data-start="903.46" data-end="907.33">turn to SVG first we create our image so</span> <span data-start="907.33" data-end="911.02">we create our SVG create a path give it</span> <span data-start="911.02" data-end="912.85">an ID and then we can move on to</span> <span data-start="912.85" data-end="914.47">actually write our heart shape which is</span> <span data-start="914.47" data-end="918.67">nice and simple m1 2.7 four five one six</span> <span

data-end="938.18">editor and so there we have our ship</span> <span data-start="938.19" data-end="941.5">export that as an SVG and then we're</span> <span data-start="941.5" data-end="943.78">going to add the circles in afterwards</span> <span data-start="943.78" data-end="946">we'll do this just by hand because this</span> <span data-start="946" data-end="949.11">is really simple it's just eight circles</span> <span data-start="949.11" data-end="951.22">so we just create a group for them</span> <span data-start="951.22" data-end="953.47">position that group in the center and</span> <span data-start="953.47" data-end="957.97">then just create eight circles so our</span> <span data-start="957.97" data-end="960.81">next step is to create that animation</span> <span data-start="960.81" data-end="963.97">but as before we need to create our</span> <span data-start="963.97" data-end="966.52">initial styling for our SVG so we're set</span> <span data-start="966.52" data-end="968.38">in a stroke a stroke width of fill color</span> <span data-start="968.38" data-end="969.67">and then we're set in the transform</span> <span data-start="969.67" data-end="971.77">origin and then there's our initial</span> <span data-start="971.77" data-end="975.43">styling for our heart so next we can</span> <span data-start="975.43" data-end="976.9">move on to create the animation and</span> <span data-start="976.9" data-end="979.99">we're going to animate the transform</span> <span data-start="979.99" data-end="985.48">fill and Stroke so if we start with the</span> <span data-start="985.48" data-end="988">color at 33% of the way through our</span> <span data-start="988" data-end="991.33">animation we want the fill to amend the</span> <span data-start="991.33" data-end="993.58">same color but the stroke to change and</span> <span data-start="993.58" data-end="995.68">then by the end we want both the stroke</span> <span data-start="995.68" data-end="1001.02">and the fill color to have changed the</span> <span data-start="1001.02" data-end="1002.79">reason for that will become apparent in</span> <span data-start="1002.79" data-end="1006.45">a moment so then once we've done the</span> <span data-start="1006.45" data-end="1008.46">color we can look at our scale so we</span> <span data-start="1008.46" data-end="1010.89">want to say by that 33% mark which when</span> <span data-start="1010.89" data-end="1012.3">our</span> <span data-start="1012.3" data-end="1015.36">stroke has changed but the actual fill</span> <span data-start="1015.36" data-end="1017.64">hasn't we want the heart to shrink and</span> <span data-start="1017.64" data-end="1019.68">then as it's doing the rest we want to</span> <span data-start="1019.68" data-end="1021.84">come to come up above its

data-end="1105.21">rotating then moving so it's definitely</span> <span data-start="1105.21" data-end="1107.97">worth knowing so there we have our</span> <span data-start="1107.97" data-end="1110.73">positions of our circles around the</span> <span data-start="1110.73" data-end="1114.45">heart so next we just want to move those</span> <span data-start="1114.45" data-end="1115.89">cells to when it's actually active</span> <span data-start="1115.89" data-end="1118.5">because we don't want the hearts circles</span> <span data-start="1118.5" data-end="1121.23">to be positioned around like that all of</span> <span data-start="1121.23" data-end="1125.04">the time so we can create some</span> <span data-start="1125.04" data-end="1126.6">additional styles for when it is active</span> <span data-start="1126.6" data-end="1128.33">and all we're doing here is just saying</span> <span data-start="1128.33" data-end="1131.27">for the circles we're going to transform</span> <span data-start="1131.27" data-end="1133.83">so we transition the transform property</span> <span data-start="1133.83" data-end="1135.27">in the opacity property so we're going</span> <span data-start="1135.27" data-end="1139.38">to animate the moving left and the</span> <span data-start="1139.38" data-end="1143.2">fading out</span> <span data-start="1143.21" data-end="1145.53">so this is really slowed down so you can</span> <span data-start="1145.53" data-end="1155.74">see exactly what's happening</span> <span data-start="1155.75" data-end="1157.67">and then this is the actual size and</span> <span data-start="1157.67" data-end="1163.05">speed that it runs out on the website</span> <span data-start="1163.06" data-end="1167.47">cool the boats were better right</span> <span data-start="1167.47" data-end="1171.23">so what else so this is an animation I</span> <span data-start="1171.23" data-end="1173.96">created for for an M framework that I</span> <span data-start="1173.96" data-end="1176.51">wrote a long time ago now and but the</span> <span data-start="1176.51" data-end="1178.04">animation I think is still really cool</span> <span data-start="1178.04" data-end="1183.2">and there's nothing on here that I</span> <span data-start="1183.2" data-end="1185">haven't already showed you how to do so</span> <span data-start="1185" data-end="1186.89">the majority of what's going on here is</span> <span data-start="1186.89" data-end="1189.65">just translate or transform so</span> <span data-start="1189.65" data-end="1192.38">translating the y-axis or translating</span> <span data-start="1192.38" data-end="1195.28">the x-axis and then I'm just hiding the</span> <span data-start="1195.28" data-end="1199.04">overflow so on the the slider in the</span> <span data-start="1199.04" data-end="1201.8">middle that's just using steps like I</span> <span data-start="1201.8" data-end="1203.09">did for the birds and it's just stepping</span> <span data-start="1203.09" data-end="1204.83">through the animation is supposed to be</span> <span data-start="1204.83" data-end="1207.32">in smooth and then again with the scroll</span> <span data-start="1207.32" data-end="1208.94">in ones they're just to smooth up and</span> <span data-start="1208.94" data-end="1211.31">down animation so the only thing</span> <span data-start="1211.31" data-end="1213.68">different here is the the actual drawing</span> <span data-start="1213.68" data-end="1219.32">which happens at first so how do we draw</span> <span data-start="1219.32" data-end="1223.55">in code we can do this with CSS and we</span> <span data-start="1223.55" data-end="1226.07">can do this with SVG so the two</span> <span data-start="1226.07" data-end="1227.69">properties that we need to do this at</span> <span data-start="1227.69" data-end="1230.56">the stroke — array and stroke — offset</span> <span data-start="1230.56" data-end="1234.02">so the circle itself I'm sorry the</span> <span data-start="1234.02" data-end="1236.27">circle itself I've created a circle it's</span> <span data-start="1236.27" data-end="1239.23">worth knowing and we set a stroke width</span> <span data-start="1239.23" data-end="1242.27">color and then we've set a — array of 50</span> <span data-start="1242.27" data-end="1243.8">so setting the — array is just gonna put</span> <span data-start="1243.8" data-end="1246.44">gaps in the stroke and the number you</span> <span data-start="1246.44" data-end="1248.66">set inside the dasher is the number is</span> <span data-start="1248.66" data-end="1251.27">how big the gap will be so by setting</span> <span data-start="1251.27" data-end="1253.16">the gap to 50 we can see we've created a</span> <span data-start="1253.16" data-end="1255.71">50 pixel gap and then a 50 pixel stroke</span> <span data-start="1255.71" data-end="1257.87">and then a 50 pixel gap and it'll just</span> <span data-start="1257.87" data-end="1261.98">repeat infinitely so if we take that</span> <span data-start="1261.98" data-end="1263.72">stroke — array and increase it to be the</span> <span data-start="1263.72" data-end="1265.46">full circumference of the circle which</span> <span data-start="1265.46" data-end="1268.28">in this case is 940 we have a stroke</span> <span data-start="1268.28" data-end="1270.17">that covers the entire circle but we</span> <span data-start="1270.17" data-end="1272.06">also have a gap that will cover the</span> <span data-start="1272.06" data-end="1275.57">entire circle as well so if we then move</span> <span data-start="1275.57" data-end="1277.43">on to offset this is where we can start</span> <span data-start="1277.43" data-end="1279.65">offsetting where the stroke drawing</span> <span data-start="1279.65" data-end="1282.68">starts so by setting that to 50 we</span> <span data-start="1282.68" data-end="1284.63">create like a little bit of that we</span> <span data-start="1284.63" data-end="1286.64">start to see 50 pixels of that gap and</span> <span data-start="1286.64" data-end="1288.26">the rest is of the stroke that we've</span> <span data-start="1288.26" data-end="1289.07">created</span> <span data-start="1289.07" data-end="1291.41">and if we set the gap to be all the way</span> <span data-start="1291.41" data-end="1292.85">up to the circumference of our circle</span> <span data-start="1292.85" data-end="1296.36">the same as they as the — array was we</span> <span data-start="1296.36" data-end="1299.54">then have no stroke whatsoever we do but</span> <span data-start="1299.54" data-end="1300.98">it's just hitting because it's been</span> <span data-start="1300.98" data-end="1303.79">pushed off and we're only seeing the gap</span> <span data-start="1303.79" data-end="1306.2">so then we can animate that so once</span> <span data-start="1306.2" data-end="1308.06">we've pushed all of our outlines out of</span> <span data-start="1308.06" data-end="1309.92">the way so that we we can't see any of</span> <span data-start="1309.92" data-end="1312.17">them we can animate that back into view</span> <span data-start="1312.17" data-end="1315.26">using keyframes so I've got a keyframe</span> <span data-start="1315.26" data-end="1317.06">animation here called draw and we're</span> <span data-start="1317.06" data-end="1318.95">setting the stroke — offset back to zero</span> <span data-start="1318.95" data-end="1321.8">so it's gone from 9:40 buck-20 where it</span> <span data-start="1321.8" data-end="1325.43">started then all I need to do is run</span> <span data-start="1325.43" data-end="1326.87">that animation so we set the animation</span> <span data-start="1326.87" data-end="1329.9">name the duration and then I'm setting</span> <span data-start="1329.9" data-end="1332.27">fill mode animation film mode here to</span> <span data-start="1332.27" data-end="1334.22">forwards and basically all that means is</span> <span data-start="1334.22" data-end="1335.66">once you reach the end of the animation</span> <span data-start="1335.66" data-end="1337.58">don't go back to what its original value</span> <span data-start="1337.58" data-end="1340.04">was just keep the keep the values from</span> <span data-start="1340.04" data-end="1343.31">the end and then when we run that you</span> <span data-start="1343.31" data-end="1345.35">can see we've drawn the outline of the</span> <span data-start="1345.35" data-end="1352.49">circle so literally all I've done there</span> <span data-start="1352.49" data-end="1355.37">is just apply two different different</span> <span data-start="1355.37" data-end="1356.99">durations and different delays and</span> <span data-start="1356.99" data-end="1358.13">things like that and then the whole</span> <span data-start="1358.13" data-end="1363.95">thing gets drawn on Lord so one more</span> <span data-start="1363.95" data-end="1368.96">example this is where the the talk</span> <span data-start="1368.96" data-end="1372.59">really came from about a year year and a</span> <span data-start="1372.59" data-end="1375.35">half ago I brought a article for web</span> <span data-start="1375.35" data-end="1377.6">designer Marc and as part of that we</span> <span data-start="1377.6" data-end="1380.12">went and looked at a whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="1380.12" data-end="1381.71">animations from around the web that were</span> <span data-start="1381.71" data-end="1383.81">doing either using flash or JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1383.81" data-end="1385.49">or something like that and we looked to</span> <span data-start="1385.49" data-end="1387.89">see if we could recreate them all in CSS</span> <span data-start="1387.89" data-end="1391.01">and the whole point of this was this was</span> <span data-start="1391.01" data-end="1392.54">the cover for the the piece when it came</span> <span data-start="1392.54" data-end="1395.87">out it was an actual print magazine so</span> <span data-start="1395.87" data-end="1397.94">we decided that we would also on top of</span> <span data-start="1397.94" data-end="1400.67">that doing animation of the cover using</span> <span data-start="1400.67" data-end="1402.26">all of the techniques that that we've</span> <span data-start="1402.26" data-end="1405.35">discussed so I thought it would be nice</span> <span data-start="1405.35" data-end="1407.42">way to event my talk would be to talk</span> <span data-start="1407.42" data-end="1410.54">about this particular animation and how</span> <span data-start="1410.54" data-end="1415.28">we got there so the the bit I'd like to</span> <span data-start="1415.28" data-end="1416.66">talk about specifically is this little</span> <span data-start="1416.66" data-end="1419.21">jumping I</span> <span data-start="1419.22" data-end="1422.62">so how did I do it so again it's it's</span> <span data-start="1422.62" data-end="1426.94">all SVG but then we jumped into our into</span> <span data-start="1426.94" data-end="1428.5">our code and we we start creating our</span> <span data-start="1428.5" data-end="1430.66">keyframes so we're saying here that our</span> <span data-start="1430.66" data-end="1433.27">keyframes called bounce and then out 25%</span> <span data-start="1433.27" data-end="1434.35">of the way through the animation we're</span> <span data-start="1434.35" data-end="1436.33">going to move up along the y-axis 24</span> <span data-start="1436.33" data-end="1438.91">pixels and then by 35% the animation</span> <span data-start="1438.91" data-end="1441.37">were back down on the ground so when we</span> <span data-start="1441.37" data-end="1447.99">run that it works but it's kind of dull</span> <span data-start="1447.99" data-end="1451">doesn't really have any life to it it</span> <span data-start="1451" data-end="1453.88">doesn't feel real it doesn't even</span> <span data-start="1453.88" data-end="1456.19">doesn't even feel like a cartoon it just</span> <span data-start="1456.19" data-end="1460.48">looks a bit bland and so we want to</span> <span data-start="1460.48" data-end="1461.95">breathe some life into our animation we</span> <span data-start="1461.95" data-end="1463.84">want to see if we can sprinkle some of</span> <span data-start="1463.84" data-end="1466.18">that Pixar magic on it so when I need to</span> <span data-start="1466.18" data-end="1467.92">do something like that what I tend to do</span> <span data-start="1467.92" data-end="1469.3">is turn to storyboarding and</span> <span data-start="1469.3" data-end="1471.19">storyboarding allows you to quickly plan</span> <span data-start="1471.19" data-end="1473.5">your animations as you can see you do</span> <span data-start="1473.5" data-end="1476.44">not need to be able to draw um but</span> <span data-start="1476.44" data-end="1478.2">basically all this is doing is saying</span> <span data-start="1478.2" data-end="1481.24">number one is where we will start number</span> <span data-start="1481.24" data-end="1483.25">two we're going to duck down ready to to</span> <span data-start="1483.25" data-end="1486.1">jump number three is reaching the top of</span> <span data-start="1486.1" data-end="1488.23">our jump number four is the London and</span> <span data-start="1488.23" data-end="1489.97">then five and six is that kind of</span> <span data-start="1489.97" data-end="1491.83">springing back into position once you've</span> <span data-start="1491.83" data-end="1495.88">landed so once you've got your plan how</span> <span data-start="1495.88" data-end="1499.78">do you call it that so step one which</span> <span data-start="1499.78" data-end="1501.37">we're saying is ducking down ready to</span> <span data-start="1501.37" data-end="1504.1">jump we're going to scale the y-axis so</span> <span data-start="1504.1" data-end="1505.24">we're going to squash it along the</span> <span data-start="1505.24" data-end="1508.33">y-axis 80% so we're going to scale from</span> <span data-start="1508.33" data-end="1511.51">in this big down to here and the next</span> <span data-start="1511.51" data-end="1513.43">point is our actual jump so at that</span> <span data-start="1513.43" data-end="1514.84">point we're going to move along the</span> <span data-start="1514.84" data-end="1517.33">y-axis like we had before up 24 pixels</span> <span data-start="1517.33" data-end="1519.37">but then also going to bring the scale</span> <span data-start="1519.37" data-end="1521.41">back up to its normal size because when</span> <span data-start="1521.41" data-end="1523.51">you jump you tend to stretch out as you</span> <span data-start="1523.51" data-end="1525.78">reach the top of your jump I've also</span> <span data-start="1525.78" data-end="1529.33">there I'm bringing the animation on 25</span> <span data-start="1529.33" data-end="1532.54">to 27 percent of the way through by</span> <span data-start="1532.54" data-end="1535.18">having that sort of that little bit in</span> <span data-start="1535.18" data-end="1537.28">the middle of 25 26 and 27 where it's</span> <span data-start="1537.28"

data-end="1541.9">jump a little bit before coming back</span> <span data-start="1541.9" data-end="1547.42">down so then step 3 was the London so 35</span> <span data-start="1547.42" data-end="1549.13">percent of our animation we're landing</span> <span data-start="1549.13" data-end="1551.14">again we've gone we've ducked down we've</span> <span data-start="1551.14"

zero our scale is a 95 percent</span> <span data-start="1557.709" data-end="1559.029">of its original size because when you</span> <span data-start="1559.029" data-end="1561.359">land you tend to shrink slightly and</span> <span data-start="1561.359" data-end="1564.19">then our last one is bringing that sort</span> <span data-start="1564.19" data-end="1566.769">of spring back to to where its

wanted</span> <span data-start="1571.899" data-end="1574.359">to run and I wanted to repeat infinitely</span> <span data-start="1574.359" data-end="1577.229">but I'd I want that delay between</span>
