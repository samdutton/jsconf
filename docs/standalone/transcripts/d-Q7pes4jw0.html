<p><span data-start="131.26" data-end="133.78">Connect but the thing is with using</span> <span data-start="133.78" data-end="135.16">something like those who connect you</span> <span data-start="135.16" data-end="136.36">don't really understand what's happening</span> <span data-start="136.36" data-end="138.79">in the or behind the scenes and there's</span> <span data-start="138.79" data-end="142.03">happening a lot and in mobile I'm not</span> <span data-start="142.03" data-end="143.92">sure if you really want to do that so</span> <span data-start="143.92" data-end="145.75">we're going to look at how to use a</span> <span data-start="145.75" data-end="147.909">different approach on communicating</span> <span data-start="147.909" data-end="150.58">between objects this</span> <span data-start="150.58" data-end="152.71">thing which is really I guess something</span> <span data-start="152.71" data-end="154.81">everybody has to address on a daily base</span> <span data-start="154.81" data-end="156.7">is how do I reflect the state of my</span> <span data-start="156.7" data-end="158.86">object in the Dom what do I do if my</span> <span data-start="158.86" data-end="161.92">object property changes and how do I</span> <span data-start="161.92" data-end="163.99">reflect that within the Dom which is</span> <span data-start="163.99" data-end="167.02">something i think really almost browsers</span> <span data-start="167.02" data-end="169.48">should just support in some way or the</span> <span data-start="169.48" data-end="171.7">other anyways but right now you see all</span> <span data-start="171.7" data-end="172.96">kinds of libraries just working around</span> <span data-start="172.96" data-end="174.19">dead and I'm going I'm going to show one</span> <span data-start="174.19" data-end="177.34">way which might inspire you to use a</span> <span data-start="177.34" data-end="178.93">similar way to communicate between</span> <span data-start="178.93" data-end="183.22">object state or using object state and</span> <span data-start="183.22" data-end="184.6">reflecting changes of that state within</span> <span data-start="184.6" data-end="186.91">the DOM and then the last thing I'm</span> <span data-start="186.91" data-end="191.29">going to show you is how i can use Tom</span> <span data-start="191.29" data-end="193.9">events and reflect and map these two two</span> <span data-start="193.9" data-end="199.3">methods on objects so stephanie was</span> <span data-start="199.3" data-end="200.59">sitting over there I've been hacking</span> <span data-start="200.59" data-end="203.41">with 74 for a while on a really really</span> <span data-start="203.41" data-end="205.89">little library called delegate and</span> <span data-start="205.89" data-end="208.66">basically this is exactly what it's</span> <span data-start="208.66" data-end="209.83">trying to do it starting to allow you to</span> <span data-start="209.83" data-end="211.39">communicate between between different</span> <span data-start="211.39" data-end="214.51">objects and the first first thing and</span> <span data-start="214.51" data-end="215.739">the important thing is different than</span> <span data-start="215.739" data-end="217.959">you know traditional event handling as</span> <span data-start="217.959" data-end="219.67">we know it in the inner javascript</span> <span data-start="219.67" data-end="222.85">libraries we use then the implementation</span> <span data-start="222.85" data-end="224.739">is very very simple I think it's about</span> <span data-start="224.739" data-end="227.35">20 lines of code it's it's just a very</span> <span data-start="227.35" data-end="228.94">very short snippet it's almost a stupid</span> <span data-start="228.94" data-end="230.29">which you could just fight yourself and</span> <span data-start="230.29" data-end="232.66">then have a helper method which allows</span> <span data-start="232.66" data-end="233.98">you or mixing which allows you to</span> <span data-start="233.98" data-end="237.01">communicate between objects there's</span> <span data-start="237.01" data-end="238.75">definitely definitely definitely less</span> <span data-start="238.75" data-end="241.36">overhead than the overhead which you</span> <span data-start="241.36" data-end="243.22">have when you use Total Connect because</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="245.95">connect allows you to handle Dom events</span> <span data-start="245.95" data-end="248.019">but also allows you to connect to method</span> <span data-start="248.019" data-end="251.11">calls and in a way it's more explicit</span> <span data-start="251.11" data-end="253.75">than pops up pops up is it's very close</span> <span data-start="253.75" data-end="256.51">to this kind of concept but with pops up</span> <span data-start="256.51" data-end="259.33">you never know where your topic or your</span> <span data-start="259.33" data-end="261.88">your published topic comes from and this</span> <span data-start="261.88" data-end="263.979">also sort of includes a lot of dangers</span> <span data-start="263.979" data-end="266.05">when you use pops up because your code</span> <span data-start="266.05" data-end="268.21">can get really really undie bugaboo you</span> <span data-start="268.21" data-end="269.74">just don't know where all these topics</span> <span data-start="269.74" data-end="273.52">get fired from you can check the code at</span> <span data-start="273.52" data-end="278.52">this address github et vous delegate and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.52" data-end="280.69">I'm going to just start showing you a</span> <span data-start="280.69" data-end="283.569">very simple example</span> <span data-start="283.569" data-end="291.919">so let's look at the source code okay so</span> <span data-start="291.919" data-end="293.449">this is the the entire source code</span> <span data-start="293.449" data-end="295.189">basically delegated to mix in so we can</span> <span data-start="295.189" data-end="297.919">mix that in into object instances and we</span> <span data-start="297.919" data-end="300.71">have two methods delegate and emit so</span> <span data-start="300.71" data-end="305.539">when I say object one delegate I pass</span> <span data-start="305.539" data-end="307.58">another object into that method call and</span> <span data-start="307.58" data-end="309.919">then I can map the functions or the</span> <span data-start="309.919" data-end="313.789">methods within the object one onto the</span> <span data-start="313.789" data-end="316.819">same named methods of the object to does</span> <span data-start="316.819" data-end="319.039">it make sense so whenever whenever I</span> <span data-start="319.039" data-end="322.4">call for instance object one show the</span> <span data-start="322.4" data-end="324.71">method object to dot show will be called</span> <span data-start="324.71" data-end="336.169">as well so let's take a look this is I</span> <span data-start="336.169" data-end="337.879">mean it's a really really simple example</span> <span data-start="337.879" data-end="340.339">so here I have a ticket ocker which</span> <span data-start="340.339" data-end="343.55">basically you see the consoler it's it's</span> <span data-start="343.55" data-end="346.909">a clock ticking and tocking it's amazing</span> <span data-start="346.909" data-end="351.949">and I can change the interval now it's</span> <span data-start="351.949" data-end="355.789">faster make it store again that's going</span> <span data-start="355.789" data-end="357.529">to take too long let's take a look at</span> <span data-start="357.529" data-end="367.73">the source</span> <span data-start="367.74" data-end="371.789">so what you see here is I've I have a</span> <span data-start="371.789" data-end="375.66">ticker constructor and most importantly</span> <span data-start="375.66" data-end="380.91">a method called tick when I call the</span> <span data-start="380.91" data-end="382.41">constructor I'm setting a default</span> <span data-start="382.41" data-end="384.539">interval of one second or thousand</span> <span data-start="384.539" data-end="389.16">milliseconds and then this line of code</span> <span data-start="389.16" data-end="392.55">here emits the ticked event it's it's a</span> <span data-start="392.55" data-end="395.009">synthetic event so after one second I'm</span> <span data-start="395.009" data-end="397.77">emitting the ticked event then here i</span> <span data-start="397.77" data-end="399.24">have the talker which is the constructor</span> <span data-start="399.24" data-end="401.19">again same it's basically the exact same</span> <span data-start="401.19" data-end="405.72">thing and whenever whenever I call talk</span> <span data-start="405.72" data-end="408.75">after the interval I'm emitting the</span> <span data-start="408.75" data-end="412.949">talked synthetic event and then I have a</span> <span data-start="412.949" data-end="415.259">tuner the tuner is basically reading the</span> <span data-start="415.259" data-end="419.789">value of the text input and now all i do</span> <span data-start="419.789" data-end="422.4">is i instantiate or I call the</span> <span data-start="422.4" data-end="424.319">constructor so I have a thicker instance</span> <span data-start="424.319" data-end="426.389">and a talker instance and then i</span> <span data-start="426.389" data-end="429.509">delegate the event of the ticker to the</span> <span data-start="429.509" data-end="434.009">talker so whenever a ticked gets called</span> <span data-start="434.009" data-end="435.84">talk of the other one gets called and</span> <span data-start="435.84" data-end="437.639">then I do the other way around whenever</span> <span data-start="437.639" data-end="440.37">talked got that called I call take on</span> <span data-start="440.37" data-end="443.699">the other one so you see I mean I'm</span> <span data-start="443.699" data-end="447.33">having a very few lines of code here the</span> <span data-start="447.33" data-end="450.33">mix in itself is as I said 20 lines of</span> <span data-start="450.33" data-end="455.28">code and I'm just doing this year I'm</span> <span data-start="455.28" data-end="457.949">mixing in the delegate into the</span> <span data-start="457.949" data-end="464.88">constructor and then I'm incensed rating</span> <span data-start="464.88" data-end="466.229">the tuner which is basically listening</span> <span data-start="466.229" data-end="468.03">to the text input whenever the text</span> <span data-start="468.03" data-end="469.83">input changes i'm setting the interval</span> <span data-start="469.83" data-end="472.139">on both instances so again i'm just</span> <span data-start="472.139" data-end="474.389">emitting events and it's a super simple</span> <span data-start="474.389" data-end="478.949">way to communicate between objects the</span> <span data-start="478.949" data-end="480.93">next next example is a little bit more</span> <span data-start="480.93" data-end="482.789">interesting it's a it's a use case we</span> <span data-start="482.789" data-end="484.62">use basically all the time and where we</span> <span data-start="484.62" data-end="487.05">kind of tend to use flash components</span> <span data-start="487.05" data-end="489.63">it's file uploading so when you upload a</span> <span data-start="489.63" data-end="492.21">large file we really like to have a</span> <span data-start="492.21" data-end="494.639">progress event so let me show you some</span> <span data-start="494.639" data-end="512.14">code here</span> <span data-start="512.15" data-end="514.19">okay i'm going to skip a couple of lines</span> <span data-start="514.19" data-end="515.99">here because the most important thing</span> <span data-start="515.99" data-end="520.22">here are the event emitters basically so</span> <span data-start="520.22" data-end="522.47">i implemented the file uploader using</span> <span data-start="522.47" data-end="524.78">dojo I oh I frame to actually upload the</span> <span data-start="524.78" data-end="527.15">file content and then I'm pulling the</span> <span data-start="527.15" data-end="528.98">server to retrieve the status of the</span> <span data-start="528.98" data-end="531.26">file upload so I know how far my file</span> <span data-start="531.26" data-end="533.18">upload gold and when went and whenever</span> <span data-start="533.18" data-end="535.55">whenever I have an update I'm going to</span> <span data-start="535.55" data-end="557.079">omit the progress event</span> <span data-start="557.089" data-end="559.759">and I'll basically what i say i know my</span> <span data-start="559.759" data-end="562.61">file uploader is emitting these certain</span> <span data-start="562.61" data-end="564.319">types of events so I'm uploaded I'm</span> <span data-start="564.319" data-end="569.139">emitting progress starred complete and</span> <span data-start="569.139" data-end="572.6">then you see the the third last line i'm</span> <span data-start="572.6" data-end="574.579">seeing uploaded a delegate and I'm</span> <span data-start="574.579" data-end="576.41">basically delegating all the events</span> <span data-start="576.41" data-end="578.089">happening in the file uploader to a</span> <span data-start="578.089" data-end="580.999">visual component so binding the state of</span> <span data-start="580.999" data-end="582.649">the visual component to the status of</span> <span data-start="582.649" data-end="584.749">the file uploader is super easy it's</span> <span data-start="584.749" data-end="590.6">just one line of code and I mean you</span> <span data-start="590.6" data-end="591.649">know it's a standard example but</span> <span data-start="591.649" data-end="595.639">basically you select the file we load</span> <span data-start="595.639" data-end="600.98">that are there we are and the upload is</span> <span data-start="600.98" data-end="603.399">complete if you would use a larger file</span> <span data-start="603.399" data-end="605.72">then we would actually see the upload</span> <span data-start="605.72" data-end="608.509">state reflect in the UI component of the</span> <span data-start="608.509" data-end="610.999">part so I have a sort of low-level file</span> <span data-start="610.999" data-end="613.73">uploader it just emits synthetic events</span> <span data-start="613.73" data-end="617.24">and whenever these events are emitted to</span> <span data-start="617.24"
