that let me come to my third lesson</span> <span data-start="633.9" data-end="639.69">and that is be human as humans we have a</span> <span data-start="639.69" data-end="643.74">gift we have the ability to put</span> <span data-start="643.74" data-end="645.87">ourselves in someone else's shoes we can</span> <span data-start="645.87" data-end="649.38">empathize with people but we don't use</span> <span data-start="649.38" data-end="652.11">it many of us don't I'm pretty sure the</span> <span data-start="652.11" data-end="654.15">expert who wrote the tweet didn't care</span> <span data-start="654.15" data-end="656.4">about my feelings as someone was trying</span> <span data-start="656.4" data-end="658.65">to contribute back to the community I'm</span> <span data-start="658.65" data-end="661.56">pretty sure he didn't he or she didn't I</span> <span data-start="661.56" data-end="671.57">can't forget he or she</span> <span data-start="671.58" data-end="675.31">but why why don't we empathize different</span> <span data-start="675.31" data-end="680.77">people more one reason maybe because we</span> <span data-start="680.77" data-end="682.6">are so absorbed in our own worlds that</span> <span data-start="682.6" data-end="685.57">we completely forgot that anyone else</span> <span data-start="685.57" data-end="689.17">exists and we don't care about them at</span> <span data-start="689.17" data-end="695.44">all and as I said another reason might</span> <span data-start="695.44" data-end="699.22">be because we are brought up that way we</span> <span data-start="699.22" data-end="701.17">are brought up to treat people how you</span> <span data-start="701.17" data-end="704.98">want others to treat you and to us that</span> <span data-start="704.98" data-end="708.7">is respect but there's a fatal flaw in</span> <span data-start="708.7" data-end="712.57">this statement because it assumes that</span> <span data-start="712.57" data-end="715.93">you and I are the same it assumes that</span> <span data-start="715.93" data-end="718.18">you and I like the same things</span> <span data-start="718.18" data-end="722.77">yep but I am NOT you and you are not me</span> <span data-start="722.77" data-end="726.03">we like and dislike different things I</span> <span data-start="726.03" data-end="729.19">don't want to be treated like you I want</span> <span data-start="729.19" data-end="731.77">to be treated like me and that applies</span> <span data-start="731.77" data-end="734.47">to all of us in this room and everyone</span> <span data-start="734.47" data-end="737.92">else in the world so instead of treating</span> <span data-start="737.92" data-end="740.65">people how you want them to treat you I</span> <span data-start="740.65" data-end="744.7">say you treat them how they need you to</span> <span data-start="744.7" data-end="749.92">treat them need not want because</span> <span data-start="749.92" data-end="751.51">sometimes you need to treat people</span> <span data-start="751.51" data-end="754.51">harshly for their own sake for example</span> <span data-start="754.51" data-end="757.12">if your kids are naughty sometimes you</span> <span data-start="757.12" data-end="759.97">have to spoil them you one like that</span> <span data-start="759.97" data-end="762.85">they won't like that but you need to do</span> <span data-start="762.85" data-end="767.89">it for their sake but how do you treat</span> <span data-start="767.89" data-end="770.44">people how do how do you know how to</span> <span data-start="770.44" data-end="772.69">treat people and how better duner need</span> <span data-start="772.69" data-end="776.92">them or not and for that you need to put</span> <span data-start="776.92" data-end="780.22">yourself in their shoes you need to</span> <span data-start="780.22" data-end="782.86">figure out what they are feeling before</span> <span data-start="782.86" data-end="787.29">you can find out but empathy is</span> <span data-start="787.29" data-end="790.93">difficult it is tempting to say come</span> <span data-start="790.93" data-end="794.7">into the room and say that I know oh</span> <span data-start="794.7" data-end="797.29">it's an it's tempting to come into the</span> <span data-start="797.29" data-end="797.67">room</span> <span data-start="797.67" data-end="801.24">say that I know exactly what you are</span> <span data-start="801.24" data-end="803.58">feeling so that's why you should do this</span> <span data-start="803.58" data-end="806.79">and follow my instructions that is</span> <span data-start="806.79" data-end="808.98">my friend that is</span> <span data-start="808.98" data-end="811.59">my friend that is because there is no way that you won't</span> <span data-start="811.59" data-end="813.24">know how I feeling because you are not</span> <span data-start="813.24" data-end="815.46">me and you have not gone through my</span> <span data-start="815.46" data-end="818.1">experiences so you don't know that</span> <span data-start="818.1" data-end="820.35">magnitude of my fears of my anxieties of</span> <span data-start="820.35" data-end="823.47">my worries and of my pain there is no</span> <span data-start="823.47" data-end="827.91">way but if you are willing to you can</span> <span data-start="827.91" data-end="831.3">come close and if you are being real</span> <span data-start="831.3" data-end="832.02">about it</span> <span data-start="832.02" data-end="834.3">you can make a connection in that moment</span> <span data-start="834.3" data-end="836.79">and when you make a connection in that</span> <span data-start="836.79" data-end="839.82">moment that is when we open up people</span> <span data-start="839.82" data-end="842.52">open up we open up because we know you</span> <span data-start="842.52" data-end="844.98">understand us and we know you care and</span> <span data-start="844.98" data-end="848.76">we trust you we trust your words this is</span> <span data-start="848.76" data-end="850.98">the golden moment where everything</span> <span data-start="850.98" data-end="854.25">methods because what you say even though</span> <span data-start="854.25" data-end="856.44">if you don't know it what you say will</span> <span data-start="856.44" data-end="858.15">stay in their hearts for a long long</span> <span data-start="858.15" data-end="862.29">time to come and if they don't act on</span> <span data-start="862.29" data-end="864.72">what you say if they don't act on your</span> <span data-start="864.72" data-end="868.05">advice that is fine because what snakes</span> <span data-start="868.05" data-end="871.25">is up to them you have
