data-start="174.76" data-end="176.14">value it really kind of going down this</span> <span data-start="176.14" data-end="178.319">road of saying do we have what we want</span> <span data-start="178.319" data-end="180.909">but we don't an interesting with this</span> <span data-start="180.909" data-end="184.06">example what's value is it a string is</span> <span data-start="184.06" data-end="186.34">it an array is it something else that</span> <span data-start="186.34" data-end="188.709">implements the same method who knows we</span> <span data-start="188.709" data-end="192.04">don't know again similar example gamma</span> <span data-start="192.04" data-end="194.349">you know truthiness we check for this</span> <span data-start="194.349" data-end="195.64">thing of saying we had we have something</span> <span data-start="195.64" data-end="198.37">does it contain something yes is what we</span> <span data-start="198.37" data-end="204.04">think it is no so we use type of you see</span> <span data-start="204.04" data-end="206.62">that a lot its operating jobs get built</span> <span data-start="206.62" data-end="209.44">in awesome and it does what it should do</span> <span data-start="209.44" data-end="211.18">for all these examples that's really</span> <span data-start="211.18" data-end="213.549">great but it doesn't do what it should</span> <span data-start="213.549" data-end="215.2">what you expect it to do for these</span> <span data-start="215.2" data-end="216.909">things and we that's probably ask all</span> <span data-start="216.909" data-end="219.43">know this we all know this type of a ray</span> <span data-start="219.43" data-end="223.09">object type of null object Oh helpful</span> <span data-start="223.09" data-end="226.18">and type of not a number number not</span> <span data-start="226.18" data-end="231.849">broken but not useful not useful so a</span> <span data-start="231.849" data-end="233.2">lot of people know we can use this you</span> <span data-start="233.2" data-end="234.879">see this in joint Java's get life is all</span> <span data-start="234.879" data-end="235.87">over the place here is an underscore</span> <span data-start="235.87" data-end="239.049">season jquery we know we can use this to</span> <span data-start="239.049" data-end="242.2">check for types and why because there's</span> <span data-start="242.2" data-end="243.459">a really good spec for it it's very</span> <span data-start="243.459" data-end="246.79">specific spec that says if this value is</span> <span data-start="246.79" data-end="249.15">we should return this string</span> <span data-start="249.15" data-end="253.359">object  same for null it's</span> <span data-start="253.359" data-end="255.489">awesome it's really really specific and</span> <span data-start="255.489" data-end="256.449">then it got to be more interesting it</span> <span data-start="256.449" data-end="258.94">says that class b the value of the class</span> <span data-start="258.94" data-end="260.979">property of this so you're talking out</span> <span data-start="260.979" data-end="262.449">internals of the javascript engines</span> <span data-start="262.449" data-end="263.44">which i'll be honest i know nothing</span> <span data-start="263.44" data-end="267.01">about and then return this string we</span> <span data-start="267.01" data-end="269.31">have objects class square bracket</span> <span data-start="269.31" data-end="271.449">fantastic and we've kind of probably a</span> <span data-start="271.449" data-end="272.56">lot of you would have seen that string</span> <span data-start="272.56" data-end="275.44">this the square bracket object thing and</span> <span data-start="275.44" data-end="278.32">we write something to use this because</span> <span data-start="278.32" data-end="280">this is dynamic because this is great</span> <span data-start="280" data-end="281.169">this is JavaScript and everything's</span> <span data-start="281.169" data-end="282.849">dynamic so we can use our caller apply</span> <span data-start="282.849" data-end="285.099">function prototype to change the value</span> <span data-start="285.099" data-end="288.669">and get to it we see this in or versions</span> <span data-start="288.669" data-end="290.409">of this and kind of loads of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="290.409" data-end="291.49">libraries again</span> <span data-start="291.49" data-end="293.59">it's an underscore similar ish things in</span> <span data-start="293.59" data-end="296.259">j korean other libraries and the magic</span> <span data-start="296.259" data-end="297.97">here is that where we're calling this</span> <span data-start="297.97" data-end="301.78">method calling it the context I mean a</span> <span data-start="301.78" data-end="303.88">lot of you may have seen this isn't yeah</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="303.88" data-end="306.22">I know this but this is not a lot of</span> <span data-start="306.22" data-end="309.52">code and I wonder how many people have</span> <span data-start="309.52" data-end="312.55">got maybe underscore or something</span> <span data-start="312.55" data-end="314.38">similar which again isn't a lot of code</span> <span data-start="314.38" data-end="315.46">in the grand scheme of things but you</span> <span data-start="315.46" data-end="317.169">know this is a lot of what we do so</span> <span data-start="317.169" data-end="319.09">checking is this is some thing what we</span> <span data-start="319.09" data-end="321.46">think it is this is such six lines of</span> <span data-start="321.46" data-end="324.25">code really not massive problem to you</span> <span data-start="324.25" data-end="325.36">need to write yourself I have something</span> <span data-start="325.36" data-end="328">that does something similar so going</span> <span data-start="328" data-end="329.53">back to what we have a four we have good</span> <span data-start="329.53" data-end="332.11">at good results for all the things we</span> <span data-start="332.11" data-end="333.49">started with we had good results for</span> <span data-start="333.49" data-end="335.59">four which is obviously we want they're</span> <span data-start="335.59" data-end="337.63">starting to get bound more useful things</span> <span data-start="337.63" data-end="339.46">back for everything else so now we're</span> <span data-start="339.46" data-end="344.02">saying right array no date but there's</span> <span data-start="344.02" data-end="346.87">two on here that still still not really</span> <span data-start="346.87" data-end="349.659">your useful when we set about the class</span> <span data-start="349.659" data-end="351.97">the internal class property so in this</span> <span data-start="351.97" data-end="353.86">case you know the body is h2 my body</span> <span data-start="353.86" data-end="356.44">element image to my span element HTML</span> <span data-start="356.44" data-end="359.08">anchor element almost too specific for</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="360.49">most cases you probably want to say is</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="362.44">it an element but you know it's your app</span> <span data-start="362.44" data-end="365.65">you do eat want and and type a number</span> <span data-start="365.65" data-end="368.44">still number still in this case just</span> <span data-start="368.44" data-end="370.84">check a type it's not really useful you</span> <span data-start="370.84" data-end="372.88">know we're gonna have to go further so</span> <span data-start="372.88" data-end="373.719">we could go further we can write</span> <span data-start="373.719" data-end="375.25">something a bit more complicated</span> <span data-start="375.25" data-end="377.53">application specific we can say we want</span> <span data-start="377.53" data-end="379.12">to check if that we want not a number to</span> <span data-start="379.12" data-end="381.759">be a type in our app because it happens</span> <span data-start="381.759" data-end="383.8">a lot we want to handle that case we</span> <span data-start="383.8" data-end="385.03">want to we want elements just be</span> <span data-start="385.03" data-end="386.68">elements and that's just pulled straight</span> <span data-start="386.68" data-end="387.819">of underscore but you could do that a</span> <span data-start="387.819" data-end="389.77">lot of different ways the point here is</span> <span data-start="389.77" data-end="392.05">we're making some special cases for</span> <span data-start="392.05" data-end="393.699">these things and we could make more</span> <span data-start="393.699" data-end="395.77">special cases for the app you're writing</span> <span data-start="395.77" data-end="396.88">that makes sense for the app you're</span> <span data-start="396.88" data-end="400.99">writing and I think that's fine we go</span> <span data-start="400.99" data-end="404.069">back to original example rewritten to</span> <span data-start="404.069" data-end="407.28">make sure we don't have these errors and</span> <span data-start="407.28" data-end="409.599">if you're thinking was just a lot more</span> <span data-start="409.599" data-end="412.81">code though really your rise an extra</span> <span data-start="412.81" data-end="414.19">one hundred and thirty-seven percent of</span> <span data-start="414.19" data-end="418.24">code or minified again yes it you've</span> <span data-start="418.24" data-end="420.49">that's how you look at it I mean yeah</span> <span data-start="420.49" data-end="422.68">it's more but do you want for me to</span> <span data-start="422.68" data-end="425.169">break in production you've got million</span> <span data-start="425.169" data-end="427.719">of users do you want Gary's prediction</span> <span data-start="427.719" data-end="429.52">to be true probably not but it's about</span> <span data-start="429.52" data-end="432.249">being sensible check four types we're</span> <span data-start="432.249" data-end="434.11">not doing so could cause an exception or</span> <span data-start="434.11" data-end="436.06">make code ambiguous don't have to do it</span> <span data-start="436.06" data-end="438.009">all of the time but when we're talking</span> <span data-start="438.009" data-end="440.199">about external data things from api's or</span> <span data-start="440.199" data-end="443.229">whatever let's check it then let's just</span> <span data-start="443.229" data-end="444.999">make sure that if we haven't been</span> <span data-start="444.999" data-end="446.259">completely in control of what we're</span> <span data-start="446.259" data-end="447.789">doing that we're actually checking other</span> <span data-start="447.789" data-end="451.3">libraries and things like that sajal</span> <span data-start="451.3" data-end="452.789">move on let's talk about classes</span> <span data-start="452.789" data-end="456.099">inheritance jos who doesn't have classes</span> <span data-start="456.099" data-end="461.08">again know this and why does it matter</span> <span data-start="461.08" data-end="463.3">why do we want classes i feels that we</span> <span data-start="463.3" data-end="465.039">gravitate towards its developers i feel</span> <span data-start="465.039" data-end="466.36">like we always end up going back to this</span> <span data-start="466.36" data-end="470.319">as a structure and rightly so i kind of</span> <span data-start="470.319" data-end="472.96">want to do this and maybe something no i</span> <span data-start="472.96" data-end="474.31">don't want to do this but kind of we do</span> <span data-start="474.31" data-end="477.669">everyone wants to write this and the</span> <span data-start="477.669" data-end="479.11">reason I say Evan wants to write this is</span> <span data-start="479.11" data-end="481.24">because things like this exist and this</span> <span data-start="481.24" data-end="483.069">wouldn't exist if someone didn't want to</span> <span data-start="483.069" data-end="485.529">write the previous slide and this</span> <span data-start="485.529" data-end="487.96">compiled to JavaScript me a more popular</span> <span data-start="487.96" data-end="491.649">example much more terse but still you</span> <span data-start="491.649" data-end="494.83">know class stands super we going back to</span> <span data-start="494.83" data-end="496.479">these same concepts all the time and</span> <span data-start="496.479" data-end="498.789">this exists because someone didn't want</span> <span data-start="498.789" data-end="501.58">to write this which again I understand</span> <span data-start="501.58"

data-end="507.46">coffee script comes along and you look</span> <span data-start="507.46" data-end="508.75">anything I it's really really good i</span> <span data-start="508.75"

data-start="993.389" data-end="994.5">often comes up first when we talk about</span> <span data-start="994.5" data-end="997.829">kind of performance talk about things</span> <span data-start="997.829" data-end="1000.86">like this and you know I've been I've</span> <span data-start="1000.86" data-end="1001.91">been down this road I think a lot of</span> <span data-start="1001.91" data-end="1002.93">people been down this road do you think</span> <span data-start="1002.93" data-end="1005.72">you know the top example is just so much</span> <span data-start="1005.72" data-end="1006.92">better it's going to be so much faster</span> <span data-start="1006.92" data-end="1009.019">and it is fast so we all know it's</span> <span data-start="1009.019" data-end="1011.12">faster okay don't even need a benchmark</span> <span data-start="1011.12" data-end="1012.439">service that it's going to be quicker</span> <span data-start="1012.439" data-end="1014.12">but is it going to be noticeably quicker</span> <span data-start="1014.12" data-end="1016.75">is it gonna make any real difference and</span> <span data-start="1016.75" data-end="1018.86">is it going to make things easy to read</span> <span data-start="1018.86" data-end="1020.809">or harder to read I think this point</span> <span data-start="1020.809" data-end="1022.579">where we have to make good to be</span> <span data-start="1022.579" data-end="1023.899">sensitive about things and as I mean</span> <span data-start="1023.899" data-end="1025.669">beginning the talk right sensible code</span> <span data-start="1025.669" data-end="1029.39">so yes it's obviously faster but is it</span> <span data-start="1029.39" data-end="1030.919">going to make things better for us in</span> <span data-start="1030.919" data-end="1033.26">the long run another example is</span> <span data-start="1033.26" data-end="1036.86">something like this and I think the top</span> <span data-start="1036.86" data-end="1040.22">line is kind of fairly rookie jquery but</span> <span data-start="1040.22" data-end="1042.709">you know whatever it's the concept here</span> <span data-start="1042.709" data-end="1043.76">is we're saying i want to get every</span> <span data-start="1043.76" data-end="1045.35">anchor in the world and i want to bind</span> <span data-start="1045.35" data-end="1047.72">click listeners to it that could be a</span> <span data-start="1047.72" data-end="1049.46">lot of anchors in the second example</span> <span data-start="1049.46" data-end="1051.2">we're using some delegation these</span> <span data-start="1051.2" data-end="1053.03">delegation you see in every NBC library</span> <span data-start="1053.03" data-end="1055.1">it's really not very hard to do and</span> <span data-start="1055.1" data-end="1057.14">again I mean I think you see there's</span> <span data-start="1057.14" data-end="1058.19">quite a lot I think this is used a lot</span> <span data-start="1058.19" data-end="1061.309">and but huge memory management benefit</span> <span data-start="1061.309" data-end="1064.429">here and finally just we go back to our</span> <span data-start="1064.429" data-end="1065.99">vision example of this kind of HTML file</span> <span data-start="1065.99" data-end="1067.25">that has nothing in it we're going to</span> <span data-start="1067.25" data-end="1068.539">have to do things like this were</span> <span data-start="1068.539" data-end="1069.919">probably gonna use templates so this is</span> <span data-start="1069.919" data-end="1071.84">kind of trivial example but we're going</span> <span data-start="1071.84" data-end="1073.19">to build up some HTML and we're going to</span> <span data-start="1073.19" data-end="1075.08">put it in the DOM and if we do it in the</span> <span data-start="1075.08" data-end="1076.909">first example we're kind of appending</span> <span data-start="1076.909" data-end="1078.77">things and then searching for something</span> <span data-start="1078.77" data-end="1080.12">and then appending something and they're</span> <span data-start="1080.12" data-end="1081.2">searching for again and then append</span> <span data-start="1081.2" data-end="1083.08">any like messages might be like a 100</span> <span data-start="1083.08" data-end="1085.76">messages we want to render and it's</span> <span data-start="1085.76" data-end="1087.86">going to just look awful on let's say</span> <span data-start="1087.86" data-end="1089.6">mobile and I work Pacific on mobile and</span> <span data-start="1089.6" data-end="1092.649">even your iphone 5 and kind of you know</span> <span data-start="1092.649" data-end="1094.58">android s fours and things like that</span> <span data-start="1094.58" data-end="1097.039">it's just it's going to just look awful</span> <span data-start="1097.039"

data-end="1106.37">and it's just a good good person while</span> <span data-start="1106.37" data-end="1107.12">we're doing the bottom we do this</span> <span data-start="1107.12" data-end="1109.309">everywhere in our code and moving from</span> <span data-start="1109.309" data-end="1111.23">this top example again we saw a lot of</span> <span data-start="1111.23" data-end="1115.549">that and would like that no it's bad so</span> <span data-start="1115.549" data-end="1116.57">when we talk about performance I think</span> <span data-start="1116.57" data-end="1118.309">actually we should be here first we</span> <span data-start="1118.309" data-end="1120.2">should be at Dom operations before this</span> <span data-start="1120.2"
