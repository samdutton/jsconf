data-end="239.31">after that but that's not that's lots of</span> <span data-start="239.31" data-end="244.019">question so Java 7 came with all lots of</span> <span data-start="244.019" data-end="248.61">new features very cool stuff i like</span> <span data-start="248.61" data-end="253.01">javascript is away why not try to put</span> <span data-start="253.01"

i have you frustrated because</span> <span data-start="298.49" data-end="301.34">well we have better tools today and</span> <span data-start="301.34" data-end="303.979">that's the main motivation i wanted to</span> <span data-start="303.979" data-end="306.59">have fun i wanted to contribute to open</span> <span data-start="306.59" data-end="310.46">source learn new stuff so that's the</span> <span data-start="310.46" data-end="312.86">challenge I want to build an</span> <span data-start="312.86" data-end="319.31">implementation but why not so I took the</span> <span data-start="319.31" data-end="323.75">challenge and made three premises for my</span> <span data-start="323.75" data-end="329.36">development I assumed that at first I</span> <span data-start="329.36" data-end="332.63">wanted to have fun on the second I</span> <span data-start="332.63" data-end="335.9">wanted to learn something new that took</span> <span data-start="335.9" data-end="339.139">me a whole lot of work and the best of</span> <span data-start="339.139" data-end="341.33">all if possible have beautiful codes</span> <span data-start="341.33" data-end="343.699">that makes things easier

data-start="357.919" data-end="360.86">or something like that so</span> <span data-start="360.86" data-end="362.96">yes you can we can have beautiful code</span> <span data-start="362.96" data-end="365.719">or at least we can try hard to have it</span> <span data-start="365.719" data-end="369.229">so I started to try to write a</span> <span data-start="369.229"
