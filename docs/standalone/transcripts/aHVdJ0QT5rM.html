<span data-start="94.47" data-end="97.799">very nice so they just got a new printer</span> <span data-start="97.799" data-end="102.24">from from Xerox they they just made this</span> <span

data-end="117.03">data from the that the photo part of the</span> <span data-start="117.03" data-end="120.36">photocopier they they could actually</span> <span data-start="120.36"

data-end="127.86">was all very new and exciting back then</span> <span data-start="127.86" data-end="131.039">it was like even more exciting than</span> <span data-start="131.039" data-end="132.06">laser printers since I</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="134.4">fear the previous Britta they had was</span> <span data-start="134.4" data-end="135.87">the laser printer

data-start="152.13" data-end="155.59">designed this thing to be basically</span> <span data-start="155.6" data-end="157.95">crude at all times there would always be</span> <span data-start="157.95" data-end="160.98">somebody at the photocopier making</span> <span data-start="160.98" data-end="163.89">photocopies so a design priority was not</span> <span data-start="163.89" data-end="166.53">to make sure that the thing doesn't Jam</span> <span data-start="166.53" data-end="169.59">it was more to make it easy for whoever</span> <span data-start="169.59" data-end="172.95">was at the machine to unjam it which is</span> <span data-start="172.95" data-end="174.33">great for a photocopier I'm not so great</span> <span data-start="174.33" data-end="178.92">for a printer so the problem occurred</span> <span data-start="178.92" data-end="183.15">that they the printer would get jammed a</span> <span data-start="183.15" data-end="185.3">lot and somebody would have to go and</span> <span data-start="185.3" data-end="189.81">unjam it which happened to Richard one</span> <span data-start="189.81" data-end="194.04">day he had a very large print job he</span> <span data-start="194.04" data-end="195.569">went to the printer about an hour later</span> <span data-start="195.569" data-end="198.329">to check if it was done and he found</span> <span data-start="198.329" data-end="200.01">that not only was his print job not done</span> <span data-start="200.01" data-end="202.769">but the printer had jammed like 2/3</span> <span data-start="202.769" data-end="205.91">print jobs back so he was very upset</span> <span data-start="205.91" data-end="207.989">this is something he'd actually dealt</span> <span data-start="207.989" data-end="210.42">with previously as well how the old</span> <span data-start="210.42" data-end="212.1">printer tended to jam as well because</span> <span data-start="212.1" data-end="217.11">printers and what she done is so he was</span> <span data-start="217.11" data-end="218.97">not a technical engineer so he couldn't</span> <span data-start="218.97" data-end="220.859">make the printer Jam less but what it</span> <span data-start="220.859" data-end="223.23">could do was patched the software so</span> <span data-start="223.23" data-end="225.299">that it would pull the printer see if it</span> <span data-start="225.299" data-end="227.7">was jammed and if it was it would email</span> <span data-start="227.7" data-end="229.59">everybody in the print queue saying the</span> <span data-start="229.59" data-end="231.079">printer is jammed you should go fix it</span> <span data-start="231.079" data-end="235.38">on the theory that if you just email</span> <span data-start="235.38" data-end="237.15">though the person whose job has gotten</span> <span data-start="237.15" data-end="238.769">jammed they might not be responsible</span> <span data-start="238.769" data-end="240.63">enough to go fix it but it's more likely</span> <span data-start="240.63" data-end="243.06">if you email everybody that somebody's</span> <span data-start="243.06" data-end="245.94">gonna go sort it out for you so Richard</span> <span data-start="245.94" data-end="247.829">decided to implement this patch for the</span> <span data-start="247.829" data-end="250.859">new printer as well so he went to look</span> <span data-start="250.859" data-end="253.62">for the printer drivers of foix and he</span> <span data-start="253.62" data-end="258">couldn't find it he wasn't too worried</span> <span data-start="258" data-end="260.37">he knew that these things usually showed</span> <span data-start="260.37" data-end="262.5">up eventually didn't even really bother</span> <span data-start="262.5" data-end="267.51">pinging Xerox about it just just waited</span> <span data-start="267.51" data-end="270.39">patiently for the software to surface as</span> <span data-start="270.39" data-end="274.95">it usually did and months later he</span> <span data-start="274.95" data-end="277.8">decided even waited long enough it</span> <span data-start="277.8" data-end="280.11">didn't seem to be surfacing so he are</span> <span data-start="280.11" data-end="286.77">surrounded and discovered that the</span> <span data-start="286.77" data-end="288.21">fellow had actually written the printer</span> <span data-start="288.21" data-end="291.84">software had just left Xerox and taken</span> <span data-start="291.84" data-end="294.84">up a professorship at Carnegie Mellon to</span> <span data-start="294.84" data-end="297.659">which Richard frequently had occasion to</span> <span data-start="297.659" data-end="301.59">to visit for work so he just waited</span> <span data-start="301.59" data-end="303.3">another month or so until he found</span> <span data-start="303.3" data-end="304.83">himself was coming to Carnegie Mellon</span> <span data-start="304.83" data-end="307.83">and went to see the fellow who wrote the</span> <span data-start="307.83" data-end="311.37">printer software and asked him
