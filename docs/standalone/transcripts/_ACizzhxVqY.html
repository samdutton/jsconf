<p><span data-start="348.02" data-end="351.169">Huaorani traditional territory and here</span> <span data-start="351.169" data-end="353.03">is a village this is an interactive map</span> <span data-start="353.03" data-end="355.52">that the Huaorani have chosen to publish</span> <span data-start="355.52" data-end="357.349">to share with the world hopefully to</span> <span data-start="357.349" data-end="359.12">share with you you can see that there's</span> <span data-start="359.12" data-end="361.57">a lot going on in this map we've got</span> <span data-start="361.57" data-end="364.13">we've got the locations of important</span> <span data-start="364.13" data-end="367.43">plants for making thatched roof we've</span> <span data-start="367.43" data-end="371.419">got

<span data-start="381.83" data-end="385.34">but that's a cell phone icon and so this</span> <span data-start="385.34" data-end="387.71">is a location where you can pick up a</span> <span data-start="387.71" data-end="389.599">cell phone signal maybe you have to hold</span> <span data-start="389.599" data-end="392.06">it in the air or maybe you have to stand</span> <span data-start="392.06" data-end="393.979">on top of a car to get it but you can</span> <span data-start="393.979" data-end="395.33">get it and that's really important</span> <span data-start="395.33" data-end="398.15">because if someone in the community gets</span> <span data-start="398.15" data-end="399.68">a snakebite and they don't have any</span> <span data-start="399.68" data-end="402.11">anti-venom then they can call for a</span> <span data-start="402.11" data-end="404.449">helicopter to come in and hopefully save</span> <span data-start="404.449" data-end="405.229">someone's life</span> <span data-start="405.229" data-end="408.08">so this map is</span> <span data-start="408.08" data-end="409.759">there's a link to it in the in the notes</span> <span data-start="409.759" data-end="412.909">it's you can see this is quite full of</span> <span data-start="412.909" data-end="414.83">resources but if you look on a</span> <span data-start="414.83" data-end="417.86">government map this area is empty they</span> <span data-start="417.86" data-end="420.44">don't put things like you know where</span> <span data-start="420.44" data-end="422.75">these important resources are on their</span> <span data-start="422.75" data-end="426.919">maps and this gives the Huaorani and</span> <span data-start="426.919" data-end="428.24">other groups an important bargaining</span> <span data-start="428.24" data-end="431.09">tool for talks with the government to</span> <span data-start="431.09" data-end="433.669">stroh hey we are using this land for</span> <span data-start="433.669" data-end="436.34">these important purposes and we don't</span> <span data-start="436.34" data-end="438.56">want this extractive industry to come in</span> <span data-start="438.56" data-end="448.849">and you know and harm us so for in terms</span> <span data-start="448.849" data-end="451.159">of what technology is needed you know</span> <span data-start="451.159" data-end="454.78">technology in itself is only a tool for</span> <span data-start="454.78" data-end="459.05">informing these other processes like</span> <span data-start="459.05" data-end="461.389">local decision making like the community</span> <span data-start="461.389" data-end="463.219">needs to be well-informed to have</span> <span data-start="463.219" data-end="466.539">meetings like not only with external</span> <span data-start="466.539" data-end="470.569">parties like governments but also for</span> <span data-start="470.569" data-end="473.029">just you know having good information</span> <span data-start="473.029" data-end="477.11">about your territory part of that is</span> <span data-start="477.11" data-end="478.819">gathering evidence like with smartphones</span> <span data-start="478.819" data-end="480.74">looking at the locations of oil spills</span> <span data-start="480.74" data-end="483.56">and things like that or mining like</span> <span data-start="483.56" data-end="488.419">mercury equipment and also preserving</span> <span data-start="488.419" data-end="490.25">traditional knowledge is an important</span> <span data-start="490.25" data-end="492.68">component of this especially with the</span> <span data-start="492.68" data-end="496.34">older generation passing on and the</span> <span data-start="496.34" data-end="498.05">younger generation in many cases</span> <span data-start="498.05" data-end="499.52">unfortunately moving to the cities</span> <span data-start="499.52" data-end="501.409">without without learning these things so</span> <span data-start="501.409" data-end="505.219">technology tools are useful for kind of</span> <span data-start="505.219" data-end="506.9">preserving that knowledge before it</span> <span data-start="506.9" data-end="511.94">might be lost so there's two main</span> <span data-start="511.94" data-end="513.77">components for these technology tools</span> <span data-start="513.77" data-end="515.539">there's the mapping components and then</span> <span data-start="515.539" data-end="517.159">the environmental monitoring components</span> <span data-start="517.159" data-end="520.339">so for the mapping tools loading</span> <span data-start="520.339" data-end="524.18">satellite imagery so that people can you</span> <span data-start="524.18" data-end="526.67">know trace our rivers and paths and the</span> <span data-start="526.67" data-end="527.899">locations the villages is pretty</span> <span data-start="527.899" data-end="533.449">important and like I said paper maps are</span> <span data-start="533.449" data-end="535.04">also a big important component of this</span> <span data-start="535.04" data-end="538.37">any maps that are made it's good to have</span> <span data-start="538.37" data-end="540.38">a hard copy because hard copies work</span> <span data-start="540.38" data-end="541.49">very well offline</span> <span data-start="541.49" data-end="542.899">in these in these sorts of environments</span> <span data-start="542.899" data-end="545.209">you can pass them out to families in the</span> <span data-start="545.209" data-end="550.779">villages and you can also you know</span> <span data-start="550.779" data-end="553.1">document the locations of

data-start="572.089" data-end="573.86">and smart phones because the sensors</span> <span data-start="573.86" data-end="576.26">aren't quite as good and also taking</span> <span data-start="576.26" data-end="579.14">like quick notes either sometimes via</span> <span data-start="579.14" data-end="581.48">text but often voices is a bit easier</span> <span data-start="581.48" data-end="584.47">when
