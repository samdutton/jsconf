<p><span data-start="91.53" data-end="94.38">I learned HTML and CSS and then I saw</span> <span data-start="94.38" data-end="96.299">that other websites had these cool</span> <span data-start="96.299" data-end="98.43">slideshows at these jQuery and so I was</span> <span data-start="98.43" data-end="100.229">like yeah I want to learn jQuery but</span> <span data-start="100.229" data-end="101.7">then I realized that I didn't understand</span> <span data-start="101.7" data-end="103.5">how jQuery worked at all so I learned</span> <span data-start="103.5" data-end="105.899">JavaScript and then I wanted to use data</span> <span data-start="105.899" data-end="108.72">in my site so I learned PHP and all this</span> <span data-start="108.72" data-end="111.479">was fine and good but a couple years in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="111.479" data-end="113.1">I kind of realized that I didn't really</span> <span data-start="113.1" data-end="115.68">like anything I was making it was you</span> <span data-start="115.68" data-end="117.329">know they looked nice</span> <span data-start="117.329" data-end="119.729">they were functional but something was</span> <span data-start="119.729" data-end="121.38">missing and I realized that all the</span> <span data-start="121.38" data-end="122.88">other developers that I was following</span> <span data-start="122.88" data-end="124.77">we're doing some really cool concept in</span> <span data-start="124.77" data-end="127.74">some really cool executions and I was</span> <span data-start="127.74" data-end="129.929">like man what am I missing and I realize</span> <span data-start="129.929" data-end="132.18">that I've been focused so much on how to</span> <span data-start="132.18" data-end="133.25">do the thing</span> <span data-start="133.25" data-end="135.23">so they don't really think about why I</span> <span data-start="135.23" data-end="137.66">was actually doing it and I think this</span> <span data-start="137.66" data-end="139.82">contributes a lot to why the web is so</span> <span data-start="139.82" data-end="141.56">frustrating and I think that we're all</span> <span data-start="141.56" data-end="144.43">kind of guilty that this a little bit</span> <span data-start="144.43" data-end="147.5">for example this fell we happen to you a</span> <span data-start="147.5" data-end="149.48">lot you read a blog you're like halfway</span> <span data-start="149.48" data-end="151.43">through agreeing to the good meat of it</span> <span data-start="151.43" data-end="153.709">no some of those video pops up and it</span> <span data-start="153.709" data-end="155.75">starts playing music now imagine you're</span> <span data-start="155.75" data-end="157.52">at work and your headphones are not in</span> <span data-start="157.52" data-end="159.47">and all sudden your whole work knows</span> <span data-start="159.47" data-end="161.24">that you're procrastinating not working</span> <span data-start="161.24" data-end="164.24">super frustrating my probably Lee's</span> <span data-start="164.24" data-end="165.86">favorite experience is if you're on a</span> <span data-start="165.86" data-end="168.29">mobile device right so you start you</span> <span data-start="168.29" data-end="170.33">know struggling through the blog and</span> <span data-start="170.33" data-end="172.19">then Olsen this ad comes up and you have</span> <span data-start="172.19" data-end="173.989">to scroll carefully to get to the top</span> <span data-start="173.989" data-end="175.7">and if you accidentally tap a going to</span> <span data-start="175.7" data-end="177.2">another site and then you know you're</span> <span data-start="177.2" data-end="179.48">not gonna come back and this is so</span> <span data-start="179.48" data-end="181.7">frustrating and the problem is is that</span> <span data-start="181.7" data-end="183.5">people like us are making those</span> <span data-start="183.5" data-end="185.33">experiences we're the ones who are</span> <span data-start="185.33" data-end="187.64">guilty and you know developers get</span> <span data-start="187.64" data-end="190.97">really mad about that and I think I just</span> <span data-start="190.97" data-end="193.19">want to give developers the benefit</span> <span data-start="193.19" data-end="195.02">adult-like maybe they're not evil people</span> <span data-start="195.02" data-end="197.39">like maybe they just don't intend to</span> <span data-start="197.39" data-end="199.79">make these experiences so awful and I</span> <span data-start="199.79" data-end="201.799">think there's two things that happen I</span> <span data-start="201.799" data-end="203.84">think the first is that we abuse new</span> <span data-start="203.84" data-end="205.97">technologies until more sophisticated</span> <span data-start="205.97" data-end="208.22">way of doing things emerges right we</span> <span data-start="208.22" data-end="210.35">like the shiny brand-new things and I'm</span> <span data-start="210.35" data-end="211.64">definitely guilty of this</span> <span data-start="211.64" data-end="213.89">when CSS animations we're starting to</span> <span data-start="213.89" data-end="216.2">get supported I was like ooh like</span> <span data-start="216.2" data-end="218.57">animate all the things it's like a party</span> <span data-start="218.57" data-end="220.82">my browser but problem was is that</span> <span data-start="220.82" data-end="222.41">people weren't coming to the site so I</span> <span data-start="222.41" data-end="224.69">was developing to like look at the cool</span> <span data-start="224.69" data-end="226.37">is that I was animating they were</span> <span data-start="226.37" data-end="229.07">actually there to do a thing and I was</span> <span data-start="229.07" data-end="231.56">just getting in the way of that the</span> <span data-start="231.56" data-end="233.239">second thing that I think happens is</span> <span data-start="233.239" data-end="235.04">that we prioritize like business goals</span> <span data-start="235.04" data-end="237.13">and metrics over the user experience</span> <span data-start="237.13" data-end="240.56">take pop-ups for example really common</span> <span data-start="240.56" data-end="242.63">used to get email acquisition and</span> <span data-start="242.63" data-end="244.4">there's a lot of blog posts to talk</span> <span data-start="244.4" data-end="246.59">about how successful they are right you</span> <span data-start="246.59" data-end="248.6">get like 20 or 30 percent more emails</span> <span data-start="248.6" data-end="249.29">woohoo</span> <span data-start="249.29" data-end="251.329">but everybody hates them so why are we</span> <span data-start="251.329" data-end="254">using them well I think it's I think</span> <span data-start="254" data-end="255.98">that the illusion that you do get those</span> <span data-start="255.98" data-end="257.84">emails but there's actually a couple</span> <span data-start="257.84" data-end="259.97">things are happening you're getting in</span> <span data-start="259.97" data-end="261.95">the way of the person's tasks that</span> <span data-start="261.95" data-end="264.26">they're trying to complete and so even</span> <span data-start="264.26" data-end="266.36">if they go past your pop-up they're</span> <span data-start="266.36" data-end="267.05">going to be fresher</span> <span data-start="267.05" data-end="268.34">with you maybe not come back to your</span> <span data-start="268.34" data-end="270.68">site also people are gonna put fakey</span> <span data-start="270.68" data-end="272.479">mattresses in there it's gonna be like</span> <span data-start="272.479" data-end="275.3">fart at fart calm edu or whatever and</span> <span data-start="275.3" data-end="277.879">just to get past that because and then</span> <span data-start="277.879" data-end="279.53">you know you have fake emails in your</span> <span data-start="279.53" data-end="281.96">list and then let's say they're nice</span> <span data-start="281.96" data-end="283.58">people they actually give you their real</span> <span data-start="283.58" data-end="285.86">email address when those people receive</span> <span data-start="285.86" data-end="287.379">an email from you they're gonna be like</span> <span data-start="287.379" data-end="289.37">they're not going to open it because</span> <span data-start="289.37" data-end="291.199">they didn't really choose to do that in</span> <span data-start="291.199" data-end="294.83">the first place and so you've all seen</span> <span data-start="294.83" data-end="296.93">this quote before I think maybe like the</span> <span data-start="296.93" data-end="298.879">million presentations I've had it but</span> <span data-start="298.879" data-end="300.77">it's a really good quote good design</span> <span data-start="300.77" data-end="302.75">when done well becomes invisible and</span> <span data-start="302.75" data-end="305.18">that's because we need to get out of the</span> <span data-start="305.18" data-end="307.879">way of our users and let them create the</span> <span data-start="307.879" data-end="310.069">function at hand so that's what we</span> <span data-start="310.069" data-end="311.93">really want to talk about being</span> <span data-start="311.93" data-end="313.729">intentional and I think this is really</span> <span data-start="313.729" data-end="315.199">important when you think about CSS</span> <span data-start="315.199" data-end="318.169">animations because a lot of times are</span> <span data-start="318.169" data-end="319.819">used for decoration so is that getting</span> <span data-start="319.819" data-end="322.46">in the way is there even a use for using</span> <span data-start="322.46" data-end="324.77">animation at all and I actually argue</span> <span data-start="324.77" data-end="327.59">yes because animation is a really unique</span> <span data-start="327.59" data-end="329.78">way to make the user feel like it's</span> <span data-start="329.78" data-end="331.849">something that's in real life so for</span> <span data-start="331.849" data-end="336.02">example this is Ryan Gosling he's</span> <span data-start="336.02" data-end="339.02">receiving some information pausing and</span> <span data-start="339.02" data-end="341.3">then shaking his head and without even</span> <span data-start="341.3" data-end="343.039">understanding or hearing anything that</span> <span data-start="343.039" data-end="344.659">he's doing you understand that he does</span> <span data-start="344.659" data-end="346.61">not agree with whatever was told to him</span> <span data-start="346.61" data-end="349.039">now look this example from Striped check</span> <span data-start="349.039" data-end="352.19">out the user is trying to submit without</span> <span data-start="352.19" data-end="354.469">filling out the fields so in addition to</span> <span data-start="354.469" data-end="356.33">just outlining the fields with red which</span> <span data-start="356.33" data-end="357.68">has come in practice it's actually</span> <span data-start="357.68" data-end="359.96">shaking like no and that's universally</span> <span data-start="359.96" data-end="361.279">known so it's helping the user</span> <span data-start="361.279" data-end="363.68">understand oh I messed up I need to do</span> <span data-start="363.68" data-end="366.83">something before the submits and this is</span> <span data-start="366.83" data-end="370.31">because what happens when you're</span> <span data-start="370.31" data-end="372.02">reducing what's called cognitive load</span> <span data-start="372.02" data-end="374.15">and so kind of load refers to the total</span> <span data-start="374.15" data-end="375.259">amount of information your working</span> <span data-start="375.259" data-end="377.539">memory can handle and so this is how</span> <span data-start="377.539" data-end="379.61">this works every day you receive so much</span> <span data-start="379.61" data-end="381.169">sensory information and stuff that you</span> <span data-start="381.169" data-end="384.229">can feel or you see or you hear and your</span> <span data-start="384.229" data-end="386.629">sensory memory actually stores the most</span> <span data-start="386.629" data-end="388.219">important information in your cognitive</span> <span data-start="388.219" data-end="390.65">load but what can also happen is when</span> <span data-start="390.65" data-end="392.719">you receive so much information that</span> <span data-start="392.719" data-end="394.729">your sensory memory can distinguish</span> <span data-start="394.729" data-end="396.649">what's the most important and this is</span> <span data-start="396.649" data-end="398.63">when you become really frustrated</span> <span data-start="398.63" data-end="400.9">and decisions are really hard to make</span> <span data-start="400.9" data-end="403.67">this awesome dude professor John sweller</span> <span data-start="403.67" data-end="405.62">actually did a lot of studies about</span> <span data-start="405.62" data-end="408.35">cognitive load theory and with that he</span> <span data-start="408.35" data-end="409.4">figured out a couple different</span> <span data-start="409.4" data-end="412.43">strategies to help create these</span> <span data-start="412.43" data-end="415.16">techniques to help people learn so three</span> <span data-start="415.16" data-end="417.17">of these strategies that we can use in</span> <span data-start="417.17" data-end="419.12">the web our show-and-tell</span> <span data-start="419.12" data-end="422.95">connecting context and Collin responds</span> <span data-start="422.95" data-end="425.33">studies have shown that people respond</span> <span data-start="425.33" data-end="427.46">better to image and narration versus</span> <span data-start="427.46" data-end="429.47">text and narration this is why seasoned</span> <span data-start="429.47" data-end="431.12">speakers encourage you not to have a</span> <span data-start="431.12" data-end="432.92">giant wall of text on a slide because</span> <span data-start="432.92" data-end="434.33">the audience will attempt to read the</span> <span data-start="434.33" data-end="435.83">slide while listening to you it get</span> <span data-start="435.83" data-end="440.36">distracted here's an actual good example</span> <span data-start="440.36" data-end="442.85">of it this is a blog post about group</span> <span data-start="442.85" data-end="446.87">texting in a really crazy climate I'm</span> <span data-start="446.87" data-end="448.34">sure you understand that states are a</span> <span data-start="448.34" data-end="450.71">little frustrating right now so instead</span> <span data-start="450.71" data-end="453.17">of just having a blog post with you know</span> <span data-start="453.17" data-end="455.66">text and some images they're actually</span> <span data-start="455.66" data-end="458.63">showing group text to help incorporate</span> <span data-start="458.63" data-end="460.73">into that narration it really helps you</span> <span data-start="460.73" data-end="462.35">understand exactly what they're trying</span> <span data-start="462.35" data-end="464.09">to communicate a lot easier than trying</span> <span data-start="464.09" data-end="467.84">to read those blocks of text the second</span> <span data-start="467.84"

it and so</span> <span data-start="477.26" data-end="479.39">you start to create a mental model of</span> <span data-start="479.39" data-end="481.16">what you think is happening based off of</span> <span data-start="481.16" data-end="482.93">whatever you're seeing it's not based</span> <span data-start="482.93" data-end="485.06">necessarily a fact but you need to</span> <span data-start="485.06" data-end="486.47">inform yourself if they actually gonna</span> <span data-start="486.47" data-end="488.81">take next and so you might be like oh no</span> <span data-start="488.81" data-end="490.55">is there a mouse even though it's just a</span> <span data-start="490.55" data-end="492.23">can cats are just weird they do what</span> <span data-start="492.23" data-end="492.76">they want</span> <span data-start="492.76" data-end="496.22">and this is really important for the web</span> <span data-start="496.22" data-end="497.96">because there's so many different screen</span> <span data-start="497.96" data-end="500.03">sizes when I first started making</span> <span data-start="500.03" data-end="502.31">websites is so awesome because it's like</span> <span data-start="502.31" data-end="505.28">800 by 600 go we're good but now it's</span> <span data-start="505.28" data-end="507.98">just impossible to create one experience</span> <span data-start="507.98" data-end="509.87">for one screen size and so you're gonna</span> <span data-start="509.87" data-end="511.64">often have a lot of stuff that's off</span> <span data-start="511.64" data-end="513.919">screen they're going to need to let the</span> <span data-start="513.919" data-end="516.979">user know that exists so these are a</span> <span data-start="516.979" data-end="518.84">couple examples from Google material</span> <span data-start="518.84" data-end="521.03">design and in this first example you can</span> <span data-start="521.03" data-end="522.74">see that when the user taps on the name</span> <span data-start="522.74" data-end="526.37">it reloads a new page now this is fine</span> <span data-start="526.37" data-end="528.4">when it's just one into like one</span> <span data-start="528.4" data-end="530.51">situation like that but imagine if you</span> <span data-start="530.51" data-end="532.11">keep going down a rabbit</span> <span data-start="532.11" data-end="533.85">and you don't understand where you are</span> <span data-start="533.85" data-end="536.61">so in the second example which is using</span> <span data-start="536.61" data-end="538.56">animation to help connect that context</span> <span data-start="538.56" data-end="540.3">when you click on the name is actually</span> <span data-start="540.3" data-end="542.88">showing where that content is coming</span> <span data-start="542.88" data-end="545.34">from and so you just already start to</span> <span data-start="545.34" data-end="548.18">know where you need to go back to in</span> <span data-start="548.18" data-end="550.74">this last strategy is called color</span> <span data-start="550.74" data-end="553.38">response so this is really important</span> <span data-start="553.38" data-end="554.61">because let's say you're driving a car</span> <span data-start="554.61" data-end="557.46">you accelerate and the car goes faster</span> <span data-start="557.46" data-end="559.41">you brake and the car goes slower but</span> <span data-start="559.41" data-end="560.76">imagine if you've never had an odometer</span> <span data-start="560.76" data-end="563.16">and how scary that would be because you</span> <span data-start="563.16" data-end="564.15">would press the pedal you're like I</span> <span data-start="564.15" data-end="565.95">think it's gonna stop or you know you</span> <span data-start="565.95" data-end="569.3">might be accelerating and this is really</span> <span data-start="569.3" data-end="571.98">important for animation because you can</span> <span data-start="571.98" data-end="573.87">really provide feedback so let's say</span> <span data-start="573.87" data-end="576.03">someone submits a form you can let them</span> <span data-start="576.03" data-end="577.79">know what the current status is the</span> <span data-start="577.79" data-end="580.44">outcome and then what the future status</span> <span data-start="580.44" data-end="584.28">is with using all these parameters we</span> <span data-start="584.28" data-end="586.89">can or these strategies rather we can</span> <span data-start="586.89" data-end="588.48">really start to make a more functional</span> <span data-start="588.48" data-end="591.15">web and so when we start to want to</span> <span data-start="591.15" data-end="592.86">incorporate these into our work and</span> <span data-start="592.86" data-end="594.63">making sure we're using it for good and</span> <span data-start="594.63" data-end="596.76">not evil we need to identify the</span> <span data-start="596.76" data-end="600.09">problems that animation can solve so the</span> <span data-start="600.09" data-end="601.71">first problem that we can solve is I</span> <span data-start="601.71" data-end="603.75">need to demonstrate the functionality of</span> <span data-start="603.75" data-end="606.57">a new product and I think oftentimes the</span> <span data-start="606.57" data-end="608.25">way that people approach this is they'll</span> <span data-start="608.25" data-end="609.63">either have like a video where you can</span> <span data-start="609.63" data-end="611.82">see all the different features or they</span> <span data-start="611.82" data-end="613.83">have a bunch of documentation in this</span> <span data-start="613.83" data-end="616.17">example by chase they actually have an</span> <span data-start="616.17" data-end="618.63">entire pop-up that blocks the navigation</span> <span data-start="618.63" data-end="621.09">and the content and even more</span> <span data-start="621.09" data-end="622.68">interesting and I would love to know</span> <span data-start="622.68" data-end="625.23">someone who works here they have a CTA</span> <span data-start="625.23" data-end="627.66">that says see a slide show like someone</span> <span data-start="627.66" data-end="628.83">would actually want to see a slide show</span> <span data-start="628.83" data-end="631.47">about more of the features but it's one</span> <span data-start="631.47" data-end="634.14">way to execute it now a better way to</span> <span data-start="634.14" data-end="636.54">execute it is to use animation and so go</span> <span data-start="636.54" data-end="638.97">ahead and play this is a website for</span> </p>

data-end="682.41">one works they wanted to promote their</span> <span data-start="682.41" data-end="686.01">app app and as you scroll down you can</span> <span data-start="686.01" data-end="687.42">see that they're giving some like little</span> <span data-start="687.42" data-end="688.95">bits of information but what's really</span> <span data-start="688.95" data-end="691.71">cool is that they're actually fixing the</span> <span data-start="691.71" data-end="694.11">mobile device and as you scroll each</span> <span data-start="694.11" data-end="696.18">different feature they go ahead and show</span> <span data-start="696.18" data-end="697.98">you in the app what that looks like and</span> <span data-start="697.98" data-end="699.87">this is really great because it's</span> <span data-start="699.87" data-end="701.07">breaking this content into smaller</span> <span data-start="701.07" data-end="703.41">digestible

go on to</span> <span data-start="709.35" data-end="711.24">another problem I have a shopping cart</span> <span data-start="711.24" data-end="714.96">on my website and I think often websites</span> <span data-start="714.96" data-end="716.34">what they do is that you're on a product</span> <span data-start="716.34" data-end="717.9">page and you go ahead and add to cart</span> <span data-start="717.9" data-end="718.98">and then they actually bring you to a</span> <span data-start="718.98" data-end="720.93">whole nother page and this is just rep</span> <span data-start="720.93" data-end="721.89">t'v because they're not really</span> <span data-start="721.89" data-end="723.93">encouraging to buy more products they</span> <span data-start="723.93" data-end="725.52">might

my favorite</span> <span data-start="730.89" data-end="733.77">t-shirt sites once you go ahead and add</span> <span data-start="733.77" data-end="736.53">to the shopping cart a drawer will be</span> <span data-start="736.53" data-end="738.18">revealed and it shows you where that</span> <span data-start="738.18" data-end="740.01">shopping cart is located and then if you</span> <span data-start="740.01" data-end="742.32">go up to the shopping cart icon it will</span> <span data-start="742.32" data-end="743.64">actually close it again they have the</span> <span data-start="743.64" data-end="746.91">same animation on the menu as well to</span> <span data-start="746.91" data-end="748.47">keep it consistent so you start to</span> <span data-start="748.47" data-end="749.64">remember you start to learn and you</span> <span data-start="749.64" data-end="752.46">start to anticipate these actions let's</span> <span data-start="752.46" data-end="755.46">look a little closer at icons so when</span> <span data-start="755.46" data-end="756.57">they're inactive they're like the</span> <span data-start="756.57" data-end="758.64">standard shopping Hut icon that's very</span> <span data-start="758.64" data-end="760.38">recognizable same with the hamburger</span> <span data-start="760.38" data-end="762.12">menu but when you hover over it it shows</span> <span data-start="762.12" data-end="763.68">you the direction that it's going to go</span> <span data-start="763.68" data-end="765.63">and then when it's active and you want</span> <span data-start="765.63" data-end="767.82">to close it it shows you that arrow as</span> <span data-start="767.82" data-end="770.58">well and so those cues for interaction</span> <span data-start="770.58" data-end="773.43">are really important because it's your</span> <span data-start="773.43" data-end="776.28">not going to want to you want people to</span> <span data-start="776.28" data-end="777.75">understand where these things are thar</span> <span data-start="777.75" data-end="781.11">off campus and the last problem that</span> <span data-start="781.11" data-end="783.21">we're going to solve I need to let the</span> <span data-start="783.21" data-end="784.89">user know that an action is taking place</span> <span data-start="784.89" data-end="788.46">behind the scenes and so let's say you</span> <span data-start="788.46" data-end="790.68">have a form submit or you're trying to</span> <span data-start="790.68" data-end="793.98">load screens in an app common thing is</span> <span data-start="793.98" data-end="795.39">to just create a standard loading gift</span> <span data-start="795.39" data-end="796.83">now this is fine</span> <span data-start="796.83" data-end="798.72">but if your process is going to take any</span> <span data-start="798.72" data-end="799.71">more than 4 SEC's</span> <span data-start="799.71" data-end="801.33">people are going to get so frustrated</span> <span data-start="801.33" data-end="803.52">with you especially if you use a loading</span> <span data-start="803.52" data-end="805.32">gift like this because anybody who's</span> <span data-start="805.32" data-end="807.12">this Mac it knows what this means is</span> <span data-start="807.12" data-end="810.06">like the wheel of death and so you want</span> <span data-start="810.06" data-end="813.36">to make it a little bit more like a</span> <span data-start="813.36" data-end="815.1">progress bar right so you could</span> <span data-start="815.1" data-end="816.87">virtually visually confirm what's</span> <span data-start="816.87" data-end="818.19">happening behind the scenes so you can</span> <span data-start="818.19" data-end="819.63">tell them where they've been what's</span> <span data-start="819.63" data-end="820.8">currently happening what's about to</span> <span data-start="820.8" data-end="823.56">happen and according to studies it feels</span> <span data-start="823.56" data-end="826.17">twelve percent faster even if it is the</span> <span data-start="826.17" data-end="830.34">same amount of time another thing that's</span> <span data-start="830.34" data-end="832.86">been really like popular these days is</span> <span data-start="832.86" data-end="834.6">skeleton screens and it's interesting</span> <span data-start="834.6" data-end="835.98">because there's actually like</span> <span data-start="835.98" data-end="837.69">conflicting information about a lot of</span> <span data-start="837.69" data-end="839.97">people think it feels a lot faster</span> <span data-start="839.97" data-end="841.11">because you're giving a hint of the</span> <span data-start="841.11" data-end="842.67">content to come so you know what to</span> <span data-start="842.67" data-end="845.19">anticipate but some people find it</span> <span data-start="845.19" data-end="846.9">distracting because it's a new pattern</span> <span data-start="846.9" data-end="848.73">that's just starting to emerge and so I</span> <span data-start="848.73" data-end="851.25">bet that you know a couple months down</span> <span data-start="851.25" data-end="852.9">the line when more apps are using this</span> <span data-start="852.9" data-end="855.12">it's gonna feel more intuitive to the</span> <span data-start="855.12" data-end="857.72">user and it's gonna feel a lot faster</span> <span data-start="857.72" data-end="860.93">and so those are all really great</span> <span data-start="860.93" data-end="863.7">executions of it but I think as</span> <span data-start="863.7" data-end="865.86">developers we have a hard time bringing</span> <span data-start="865.86" data-end="867.69">it back to practice at our workspaces</span> <span data-start="867.69" data-end="870.09">and so for this next part I'd like to go</span> <span data-start="870.09" data-end="872.04">over some steps that helped me bring it</span> <span data-start="872.04" data-end="875.46">to my work common challenges that I</span> <span data-start="875.46" data-end="878.07">think a lot of us have our time creating</span> <span data-start="878.07" data-end="879.74">animations seems really time-consuming</span> <span data-start="879.74" data-end="882.45">and often times they come in late in the</span> <span data-start="882.45" data-end="885.03">process and we don't feel like we have</span> <span data-start="885.03" data-end="887.03">enough time to give it its due diligence</span> <span data-start="887.03" data-end="889.59">establishing process to create that</span> <span data-start="889.59" data-end="891.78">language between you and the designers</span> <span data-start="891.78" data-end="894.9">or any of the strategists can be</span> <span data-start="894.9" data-end="897.42">complicated and also skill there's so</span> <span data-start="897.42" data-end="899.43">much to learn and so many different</span> <span data-start="899.43" data-end="901.22">options for it and it can be a little</span> <span data-start="901.22" data-end="904.08">intimidating so the first step is to</span> <span data-start="904.08" data-end="905.67">start the discussion about animation</span> <span data-start="905.67" data-end="908.16">early in the process oftentimes people</span> <span data-start="908.16" data-end="910.8">treat animation as decoration and so it</span> <span data-start="910.8" data-end="912.18">comes like at the very end like ooh we</span> <span data-start="912.18" data-end="913.98">should make the hover state of a CTA</span> <span data-start="913.98" data-end="916.53">animated or oh we have a form submit we</span> <span data-start="916.53" data-end="917.76">should probably create an animated gif</span> <span data-start="917.76" data-end="921.09">but you really want to couple it as far</span> <span data-start="921.09" data-end="923.01">in advance as possible but definitely</span> <span data-start="923.01" data-end="924.03">after you start to talk about the</span> <span data-start="924.03" data-end="925.98">animation or information architecture</span> <span data-start="925.98" data-end="927.93">and start asking those questions like</span> <span data-start="927.93" data-end="931.41">what can animation help solve the second</span> <span data-start="931.41" data-end="933.529">step is to use storyboards</span> <span data-start="933.529" data-end="936.079">to brainstorm ideas quickly now this is</span> <span data-start="936.079" data-end="937.73">that pretty but this is a real thing</span> <span data-start="937.73" data-end="939.92">that I've used to be able to create an</span> <span data-start="939.92" data-end="942.17">animation what's nice about it when you</span> <span data-start="942.17" data-end="943.939">bring something to pen and paper is this</span> <span data-start="943.939" data-end="945.98">disposable you don't get attached to it</span> <span data-start="945.98" data-end="947.029">like you would if you created a</span> <span data-start="947.029" data-end="948.889">prototype right away and it's really</span> <span data-start="948.889" data-end="951.439">easy to a bunch of ideas out and to be</span> <span data-start="951.439" data-end="953.93">able to work with others on it once you</span> <span data-start="953.93" data-end="955.399">and the team feels really good about</span> <span data-start="955.399" data-end="956.209">that</span> <span data-start="956.209" data-end="957.98">you can go ahead and create a prototype</span> <span data-start="957.98" data-end="959.959">or motion mock-up and that could be a</span> <span data-start="959.959" data-end="961.49">really good base of discussion because</span> <span data-start="961.49" data-end="963.68">it's actually animated there's a couple</span> <span data-start="963.68" data-end="964.79">of different tools that are really</span> <span data-start="964.79" data-end="966.019">awesome for this</span> <span data-start="966.019" data-end="968.36">the first tool framer and principal are</span> <span data-start="968.36" data-end="970.04">kind of more drag-and-drop so they're</span> <span data-start="970.04" data-end="971.089">really great for like standard</span> <span data-start="971.089" data-end="975.589">animations and they have a lower entry</span> <span data-start="975.589" data-end="977.209">point so like your designers can work in</span> <span data-start="977.209" data-end="980.089">it as well however if you need to do</span> <span data-start="980.089" data-end="982.249">something that's really custom you might</span> <span data-start="982.249" data-end="983.449">want to look into something like green</span> <span data-start="983.449" data-end="986.48">sock JavaScript which is amazing but it</span> <span data-start="986.48" data-end="987.47">is you know it does require</span> <span data-start="987.47" data-end="990.23">understanding JavaScript for me I just</span> <span data-start="990.23" data-end="992.959">like opening up a code pen and creating</span> <span data-start="992.959" data-end="994.67">a pen I think it's really nice to be</span> <span data-start="994.67" data-end="996.139">able to have all that code there and</span> <span data-start="996.139" data-end="997.759">then to sit with the designers and</span> <span data-start="997.759" data-end="999.8">strategists and kind of noodle with it</span> <span data-start="999.8" data-end="1001.54">and make sure that the duration is good</span> <span data-start="1001.54" data-end="1005.74">the timing is good etc the next step</span> <span data-start="1005.74" data-end="1007.48">once you guys feel really good about</span> <span data-start="1007.48" data-end="1009.43">where the animation is is want to test</span> <span data-start="1009.43" data-end="1011.589">test and test some more and there's two</span> <span data-start="1011.589" data-end="1014.17">components to this the first is you want</span> <span data-start="1014.17" data-end="1016.18">to ask people who have not seen the</span> <span data-start="1016.18" data-end="1018.399">animation before a couple questions one</span> <span data-start="1018.399" data-end="1020.559">is it legible and that's not even just</span> <span data-start="1020.559" data-end="1022.209">text but like do you understand what's</span> <span data-start="1022.209" data-end="1025.51">going on and second how does it make you</span> <span data-start="1025.51" data-end="1027.579">feel you can really understand a lot</span> <span data-start="1027.579" data-end="1030.25">about if they're animation is creating</span> <span data-start="1030.25" data-end="1032.709">anxiety or is creating calm or how that</span> <span data-start="1032.709" data-end="1035.38">feels by asking that question and these</span> <span data-start="1035.38" data-end="1036.64">questions are really important because</span> <span data-start="1036.64" data-end="1038.62">the more you work with animation the</span> <span data-start="1038.62" data-end="1039.88">more you're going to start to think that</span> <span data-start="1039.88" data-end="1041.74">it's too slow because you already know</span> <span data-start="1041.74" data-end="1045.25">what's gonna say and then secondarily if</span> <span data-start="1045.25" data-end="1047.26">people are you know not sure if they</span> <span data-start="1047.26" data-end="1049.09">want to animate something a B test to</span> <span data-start="1049.09" data-end="1053.62">validate those decisions v once you</span> <span data-start="1053.62" data-end="1055">actually decide to ship go ahead and</span> <span data-start="1055" data-end="1057.549">document those designs design design</span> <span data-start="1057.549" data-end="1061.75">decisions in your digital style guide so</span> <span data-start="1061.75" data-end="1063.01">if you have a digital style guide which</span> <span data-start="1063.01" data-end="1065.26">you should you can go ahead and document</span> <span data-start="1065.26" data-end="1066.82">those decisions in it it's really</span> <span data-start="1066.82" data-end="1067.74">important</span> <span data-start="1067.74" data-end="1069.48">when you do this to show what you have</span> <span data-start="1069.48" data-end="1071.64">done in what you've already tried and</span> <span data-start="1071.64" data-end="1073.62">you don't want to do that'll help</span> <span data-start="1073.62" data-end="1075.809">other developers in the future make good</span> <span data-start="1075.809" data-end="1078.12">decisions you also want to provide code</span> <span data-start="1078.12" data-end="1080.039">snippets that include the duration</span> <span data-start="1080.039" data-end="1082.049">easing and timing because that's going</span> <span data-start="1082.049" data-end="1084.12">to help make the animations a lot more</span> <span data-start="1084.12" data-end="1085.679">efficient when they build new modules</span> <span data-start="1085.679" data-end="1087.299">and then you also want to establish</span> <span data-start="1087.299" data-end="1090.45">naming conventions it's you know how</span> <span data-start="1090.45" data-end="1092.279">messy it can get if everyone's on the</span> <span
