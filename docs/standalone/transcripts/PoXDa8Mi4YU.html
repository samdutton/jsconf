whatever it is uh the the the goal is</span> <span data-start="200.47" data-end="201.85">that you you you have a you build a</span> <span data-start="201.85" data-end="203.769">village for guinea pigs

data-end="249.88">begin what kind of artifact do I want to</span> <span data-start="249.88" data-end="252.07">use as my reference ah there's a couple</span> <span data-start="252.07"

data-end="260.079">design process it seemed to be I would</span> <span data-start="260.079" data-end="262.69">get a mock-up and then be told to like</span> <span data-start="262.69" data-end="264.61">work down the stack from there where I'm</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="266.2">supposed to figure out how it works</span> <span data-start="266.2" data-end="269.2">based
