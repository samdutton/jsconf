data-end="1650.43">the question I had was I'm one of the</span> <span data-start="1650.43" data-end="1654.15">first examples you had and you said that</span> <span data-start="1654.15" data-end="1657.06">you can set font variant ligatures but</span> <span data-start="1657.06" data-end="1659.88">then the higher class way was the</span> <span data-start="1659.88" data-end="1661.98">feature settings and then you went into</span> <span data-start="1661.98" data-end="1665.1">about support like support I'm and I</span> <span data-start="1665.1" data-end="1666.81">think I missed the part where you were</span> <span data-start="1666.81" data-end="1669.86">explaining why this is important or else</span> <span data-start="1669.86" data-end="1672.66">what would blow up if I don't do it okay</span> <span data-start="1672.66" data-end="1676.17">um it's not really the browser support</span> <span data-start="1676.17" data-end="1678.78">for font feature settings is very good</span> <span data-start="1678.78" data-end="1680.49">and if you just want to use font feature</span> <span data-start="1680.49" data-end="1682.44">settings that's totally fine and that</span> <span data-start="1682.44" data-end="1685.89">will probably work for most cases if you</span> <span data-start="1685.89" data-end="1687.96">are using a lot of open type features in</span> <span data-start="1687.96" data-end="1689.76">different ways those things won't</span> <span data-start="1689.76" data-end="1693.54">cascade down the document so if you set</span> <span data-start="1693.54" data-end="1695.19">certain open type features on the body</span> <span data-start="1695.19" data-end="1697.35">you're going to have to read Eclair all</span> <span data-start="1697.35" data-end="1699.75">of those on the heading so in the case</span> <span data-start="1699.75" data-end="1702.3">of me writing a library to help people</span> <span data-start="1702.3" data-end="1703.86">with that I needed to avoid that issue</span> <span data-start="1703.86" data-end="1706.86">but in most situations you can just use</span> <span data-start="1706.86" data-end="1708.36">font feature settings and no</span> <span data-start="1708.36" data-end="1711.75">we'll
