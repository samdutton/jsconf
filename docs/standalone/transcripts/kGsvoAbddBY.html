were using there probably was the</span> <span data-start="234.59" data-end="237.86">latest framework so you I'm just going</span> <span data-start="237.86" data-end="239.9">to call it framework X for now and it's</span> <span data-start="239.9" data-end="241.34">the way of the future it's the way of</span> <span data-start="241.34" data-end="242.87">the future you know this is the latest</span> <span data-start="242.87" data-end="244.61">and greatest thing this must be what the</span> <span data-start="244.61" data-end="246.08">future looks like you know it's not</span> <span

the future it's all framework X huh</span> <span data-start="255.4" data-end="257.9">and you start writing blog posts and</span> <span data-start="257.9" data-end="260.12">maybe you give some talks you go to meet</span> <span data-start="260.12" data-end="262.37">ups and okay you've reached expert level</span> <span data-start="262.37" data-end="265.37">okay and and you're becoming kind

<p><span data-start="271.37" data-end="272.75">I know everything about this that you</span> <span data-start="272.75" data-end="274.43">should listen to me I know I know what</span> <span data-start="274.43" data-end="276.979">it's all about everything is well and</span> <span data-start="276.979" data-end="280.55">dandy for a little while and you think</span> <span data-start="280.55" data-end="282.25">of yourself maybe as uber developers</span> <span data-start="282.25" data-end="285.569">maybe or not maybe I kind of self to see</span> <span data-start="285.569" data-end="289.169">but then this happens new JavaScript</span> <span data-start="289.169" data-end="291.389">framework appears on the horizon okay</span> <span data-start="291.389" data-end="293.249">people start using it and maybe you</span> <span data-start="293.249" data-end="294.689">think oh this is just the latest trend</span> <span data-start="294.689" data-end="295.8">you think you know this is a flash in</span> <span data-start="295.8" data-end="297.389">the pan that is going to go away you</span> <span data-start="297.389" data-end="298.979">know framework X is so much better in</span> <span data-start="298.979" data-end="300.479">all these ways you know I don't have to</span> <span data-start="300.479" data-end="302.669">pay attention to this but people you</span> <span data-start="302.669" data-end="304.529">know pick it up more and more and sort</span> <span data-start="304.529" data-end="307.499">of start adopting it and writing posts</span> <span data-start="307.499" data-end="308.869">about it and this is where all the</span> <span data-start="308.869" data-end="311.52">excitement is happening like nowadays it</span> <span data-start="311.52" data-end="313.11">seems to be like in the direction of</span> <span data-start="313.11" data-end="315.509">react next year probably something else</span> <span data-start="315.509" data-end="320.789">but you know basically yeah it's sort of</span> <span data-start="320.789" data-end="322.289">this situation you've probably seen this</span> <span data-start="322.289" data-end="325.229">before sort of like oh yeah backbone</span> <span data-start="325.229" data-end="326.729">it's the new thing yeah it's the new</span> <span data-start="326.729" data-end="330.36">hotness Oh angular yeah yeah react yeah</span> <span data-start="330.36" data-end="333.059">and it's just this it's like a fashion</span> <span data-start="333.059" data-end="335.879">trend it's like man is it is this actual</span> <span data-start="335.879" data-end="337.919">progress or is it just changes in</span> <span data-start="337.919"

data-end="343.979">frustrating because like you know you</span> <span data-start="343.979" data-end="345.659">start at one of these years in the past</span> <span data-start="345.659" data-end="347.309">year and you've seen this all in your</span> <span data-start="347.309" data-end="349.229">kind of like okay I've been through this</span> <span data-start="349.229" data-end="351.959">before like why am I even learning this</span> <span data-start="351.959" data-end="353.309">new framework and you kind of get pissed</span> <span data-start="353.309" data-end="354.779">off and that's where the grumpy</span> <span data-start="354.779" data-end="357.24">developer sort of comes in you want to</span> <span data-start="357.24" data-end="360.209">avoid that so yeah this is part of my</span> <span data-start="360.209" data-end="362.61">perspective this is like okay how can I</span> <span data-start="362.61" data-end="364.74">sort of change my attitude to not be</span> <span data-start="364.74" data-end="366.24">like that to sort of be receptive to</span> <span data-start="366.24" data-end="369.779">this to be able to keep up with it this</span> <span data-start="369.779" data-end="371.699">is her cleitus putting on his developer</span> <span data-start="371.699" data-end="374.18">hat in this case this JavaScript head</span> <span data-start="374.18" data-end="376.86">technology is constantly changing cannot</span> <span data-start="376.86" data-end="379.009">step twice into the same stat tech stack</span> <span data-start="379.009" data-end="381.24">which is exactly the case it's</span> <span data-start="381.24" data-end="382.589">constantly changing people are</span> <span data-start="382.589" data-end="384.329">constantly changing even the libraries</span> <span data-start="384.329" data-end="386.369">themselves are changing over time we saw</span> <span data-start="386.369" data-end="388.529">that with angular 1 2 angular 2 and now</span> <span data-start="388.529" data-end="390.209">people got all frustrated and you is</span> <span data-start="390.209" data-end="391.8">everything changed like why don't I</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="393.509">don't just move to react down you know</span> <span data-start="393.509" data-end="395.269">you know people get frustrated with that</span> <span data-start="395.269" data-end="398.249">this is a something you probably saw Ben</span> <span data-start="398.249" data-end="401.969">nato's blog about angularjs in</span> <span data-start="401.969" data-end="404.189">particular and it's kind of like a</span> <span data-start="404.189" data-end="406.11">optimistic perspective this angular JS</span> <span data-start="406.11" data-end="408.569">one it's optimistic because there's</span> <span data-start="408.569" data-end="410.639">still upward trend it's sort of like</span> <span data-start="410.639" data-end="412.769">your feelings get better about the</span> <span data-start="412.769" data-end="414.569">framework over time you're sort of like</span> <span data-start="414.569" data-end="418.259">you start out with nothing at x 0 you go</span> <span data-start="418.259" data-end="419.2">on your like</span> <span data-start="419.2" data-end="420.67">is pretty cool and then you're like you</span> <span data-start="420.67" data-end="422.38">get frustrated with pieces of it and you</span> <span data-start="422.38" data-end="424.45">dip down into a valley and then you go</span> <span data-start="424.45" data-end="426.4">up again you plateau and then you're</span> <span data-start="426.4" data-end="428.17">like this is really crappy why did they</span> <span data-start="428.17" data-end="430.42">do this you know but you're you feel</span> <span data-start="430.42" data-end="431.62">like you're making progress because</span> <span data-start="431.62" data-end="432.88">you're getting more comfortable with</span> <span data-start="432.88" data-end="435.79">that framework you know this is this is</span> <span data-start="435.79" data-end="436.87">a good thing right you're making</span> <span data-start="436.87" data-end="440.74">progress but the reality is we change</span> <span data-start="440.74" data-end="442.66">out framework so often especially in the</span> <span data-start="442.66" data-end="444.91">front end world and the JavaScript world</span> <span data-start="444.91" data-end="448">that it feels to me like more like this</span> <span data-start="448" data-end="449.8">like you start out from time zero with</span> <span data-start="449.8" data-end="451.96">nothing you go up to a certain level you</span> <span data-start="451.96" data-end="454.09">learn this framework and then this is</span> <span data-start="454.09" data-end="456.46">like over the course of years maybe your</span> <span data-start="456.46" data-end="458.59">whole career or something and then you</span> <span data-start="458.59" data-end="460.96">plateau and then you hit a valley again</span> <span data-start="460.96" data-end="463.54">because you basically have to discard a</span> <span data-start="463.54" data-end="465.31">bunch of your knowledge and you have to</span> <span data-start="465.31" data-end="467.41">be happy well not you don't have to be</span> <span data-start="467.41" data-end="469.96">happy with that you have to be okay with</span> <span data-start="469.96" data-end="471.94">that to be able to continue being a</span> <span data-start="471.94" data-end="474.55">developer so i would say fifty percent</span> <span data-start="474.55" data-end="476.38">at least maybe greater of your knowledge</span> <span data-start="476.38" data-end="479.44">that you worked so hard to acquire is</span> <span data-start="479.44" data-end="481.75">just chucked out the

to</span> <span data-start="486.04" data-end="489.91">do so you're later career becomes okay</span> <span data-start="489.91" data-end="491.86">maybe i'm not an expert in anything</span> <span

data-end="1018.98">years or so that kind of like actually</span> <span data-start="1018.98" data-end="1020.93">experiencing that is kind of a pain but</span> <span data-start="1020.93"

data-end="1047.9">this happen with developers a lot over</span> <span data-start="1047.9" data-end="1050">time like and they they're younger they</span> <span data-start="1050" data-end="1052.85">start out it's kind of bull it's</span> <span data-start="1052.85" data-end="1054.68">exciting it's new and they get become</span> <span data-start="1054.68" data-end="1056.39">very confident which is ok you know like</span> <span data-start="1056.39" data-end="1059.09">and then you learn like man I don't know</span> <span data-start="1059.09" data-end="1061.25">as much as I thought I knew and that is</span> <span data-start="1061.25" data-end="1063.8">like yeah that's very true or philosophy</span> <span data-start="1063.8" data-end="1067.37">in general to sort of you start with</span> <span data-start="1067.37" data-end="1069.41">like a sophomoric view of the world and</span> <span data-start="1069.41" data-end="1073.09">then you learn crap I don't know nothing</span> <span data-start="1073.09" data-end="1077.66">no grammar be selective about applying</span> <span data-start="1077.66" data-end="1080.93">old knowledge so yeah we have to ditch a</span>

data-end="1086.51">the principles and things like that that</span> <span data-start="1086.51" data-end="1088.76">can be applied generally we have that</span> <span data-start="1088.76"

data-end="1098.33">job and you're like I want to use</span> <span data-start="1098.33" data-end="1100.25">everything I used to use at my old job</span> <span data-start="1100.25"

data-end="1119.63">was a little faster and no one wants to</span> <span data-start="1119.63" data-end="1122.36">hear that it's just annoying so you have</span> <span data-start="1122.36" data-end="1124.429">to sort of be selective with that</span> <span data-start="1124.429" data-end="1126.11">there's still useful stuff that you know</span> <span data-start="1126.11" data-end="1128.09">obviously but not all of that is going</span> <span data-start="1128.09" data-end="1129.679">to be useful not all of your experience</span> <span data-start="1129.679" data-end="1132.019">is still useful so think twice before</span> <span data-start="1132.019" data-end="1136.07">you you give advice with it and this is</span> <span data-start="1136.07" data-end="1137.48">something that came out from a talk</span> <span data-start="1137.48" data-end="1139.97">yesterday from Aaron Quint stock which</span> <span data-start="1139.97" data-end="1141.38">was awesome by the way if you didn't get</span> <span data-start="1141.38" data-end="1143.24">a chance to see it watch it online when</span> <span data-start="1143.24" data-end="1144.5">they post it it's definitely worth</span> <span data-start="1144.5" data-end="1146.09">seeing and it's very similar to the</span> <span data-start="1146.09" data-end="1148.669">sakai thing but he does a very good job</span> <span data-start="1148.669" data-end="1151.57">with a bill cool things with blank</span> <span data-start="1151.57" data-end="1154.669">choose your tool and just build build</span> <span data-start="1154.669" data-end="1156.169">the thing be concerned with the thing</span> <span data-start="1156.169" data-end="1158.45">itself like that the end not the means</span> <span data-start="1158.45" data-end="1160.82">to an end so just pick up the hammer or</span> <span data-start="1160.82" data-end="1162.2">the Swiss Army knife start building</span> <span data-start="1162.2" data-end="1164.389">stuff and put it down put it down at the</span> <span data-start="1164.389" data-end="1167.63">end of the day be proud of you know what</span> <span data-start="1167.63" data-end="1171.08">you've made basically and then yeah this</span> <span data-start="1171.08" data-end="1172.37">is kind of what i was implying before</span> <span data-start="1172.37" data-end="1174.74">this isn't actually a advice to my</span> <span data-start="1174.74" data-end="1176.75">younger self this advice my current self</span> <span data-start="1176.75" data-end="1178.82">to you so so I haven't really perfected</span> <span data-start="1178.82" data-end="1180.47">how to get to these points I've</span> <span data-start="1180.47" data-end="1182.21">convinced myself of these things but I</span> <span data-start="1182.21" data-end="1183.889">don't necessarily know how to get to</span> <span data-start="1183.889" data-end="1186.529">them so hopefully maybe that helps you</span> <span data-start="1186.529" data-end="1189.019">too but I'm not I don't know the way to</span> <span data-start="1189.019" data-end="1191.51">get to feel all these things like I can</span> <span data-start="1191.51" data-end="1193.73">convince myself okay I need to have this</span> <span data-start="1193.73" data-end="1195.73">kind of attitude like that but like</span> <span data-start="1195.73" data-end="1197.75">actually doing it and actually having</span> <span data-start="1197.75" data-end="1198.86">the experience of doing that as a</span> <span data-start="1198.86" data-end="1201.679">different thing so maybe that's you know</span> <span data-start="1201.679" data-end="1204.74">for everyone else to work out I think</span> <span data-start="1204.74" data-end="1206">the good thing that came out of this is</span> <span data-start="1206"

data-end="1214.78">competent see kind of goes up where</span> <span data-start="1214.78" data-end="1216.67">sort of like the the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1216.67" data-end="1218.83">competency level kind of was a sine wave</span> <span data-start="1218.83" data-end="1221.02">over time and it felt like you weren't</span> <span data-start="1221.02" data-end="1222.97">really making general progress which is</span> <span data-start="1222.97" data-end="1224.59">kind of pessimistic crappy of you</span> <span data-start="1224.59"
