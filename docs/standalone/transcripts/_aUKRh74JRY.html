help developers secure</span> <span data-start="118.09" data-end="120.94">software and build security into the</span> <span data-start="120.94" data-end="124.45">culture of their dev teams and also

data-end="137.08">40,000 modules now and bridge the</span> <span data-start="137.08" data-end="142.239">security and devel try to make them play</span> <span data-start="142.239" data-end="143.83">nicely together and we'll talk about</span> <span data-start="143.83" data-end="148.989">that more later so as it turns out when</span> <span data-start="148.989" data-end="153.349">it comes to security we're</span> <span data-start="153.349" data-end="159.69">right that's basically it nothing is a</span> <span data-start="159.69" data-end="162.569">hundred percent secure this is this is a</span> <span data-start="162.569" data-end="165.209">realization that we have to come to in</span> <span data-start="165.209" data-end="167.459">building software there's going to be</span> <span data-start="167.459" data-end="169.739">bugs we're going to inject security</span> <span data-start="169.739" data-end="173.04">flaws we are going to be eventually at</span> <span data-start="173.04" data-end="178.849">some point so let's talk about risk</span> <span data-start="178.849" data-end="180.959">risks a board game about world</span> <span data-start="180.959" data-end="185.64">domination you spread out armies around</span> <span data-start="185.64" data-end="187.56">the board in pursuit of conquering the</span> <span data-start="187.56" data-end="189.75">entire Earth it's a it's very slow to</span> <span data-start="189.75" data-end="192.42">move around armies so typical strategy</span> <span data-start="192.42" data-end="195.09">is to focus on deploying new armies at</span> <span data-start="195.09" data-end="197.37">entry point or entry points for defense</span> <span data-start="197.37" data-end="199.86">and building up armies when you're going</span> <span data-start="199.86" data-end="203.519">to attack right in a risk battle you</span> <span data-start="203.519" data-end="205.079">match dice one-to-one highest to lowest</span> <span data-start="205.079" data-end="207.66">and the attacker gets three dice the</span> <span data-start="207.66" data-end="209.4">defender gets two dice right there you</span> <span data-start="209.4" data-end="210.69">notice that the attacker has the</span> <span data-start="210.69" data-end="212.94">advantage but the defender can only roll</span> <span data-start="212.94" data-end="215.579">with as many dices they have armies so</span> <span data-start="215.579" data-end="217.59">when you only have one died left you're</span> <span data-start="217.59" data-end="220.23">rolling one against three so the</span> <span data-start="220.23" data-end="221.519">attacker has broken through the outer</span> <span data-start="221.519" data-end="223.109">boundary and it's pretty easy to sweep</span> <span data-start="223.109" data-end="227.28">through and if Iceland attacks Greenland</span> <span data-start="227.28" data-end="229.5">in this scenario which is totally prone</span> <span data-start="229.5" data-end="232.68">to happen Greenland is going to get a</span> <span data-start="232.68" data-end="234.959">roll with two dice and it's going to be</span> <span data-start="234.959" data-end="237.03">a pretty big battle but if green land</span> <span data-start="237.03" data-end="240.12">only has is the only need offends with</span> <span data-start="240.12" data-end="243.12">one army in this scenario let's be</span> <span data-start="243.12" data-end="245.13">honest

<p><span data-start="245.13" data-end="247.68">North America yes including Alberta</span> <span data-start="247.68" data-end="250.29">sorry Alberta and attackers have the</span> <span data-start="250.29" data-end="252.359">advantage attackers basically have the</span> <span data-start="252.359" data-end="254.549">advantage and that's it's it it's akin</span> <span data-start="254.549" data-end="256.109">to the way it works in software two</span> <span data-start="256.109" data-end="258.81">attackers have to find one flaw to get</span> <span data-start="258.81" data-end="261.81">it gain a foothold and as defenders as</span> <span data-start="261.81" data-end="263.729">developers we have to find and address</span> <span data-start="263.729"

data-end="271.74">think that anybody's going to disagree</span> <span data-start="271.74" data-end="273.75">with me that billing software is hard</span> <span data-start="273.75" data-end="274.77">enough without adding additional</span> <span data-start="274.77" data-end="277.59">complexities software is also full of</span> <span data-start="277.59" data-end="280.349">opinions

data-start="285.4" data-end="289.69">whoo but a lot of what you build doesn't</span> <span data-start="289.69" data-end="291.759">mean crap if it's not built on a</span> <span data-start="291.759"

data-end="306.34">constraints like time and money a boss</span> <span data-start="306.34" data-end="308.02">you know pointing her boss that's</span> <span data-start="308.02" data-end="309.16">breathing down our neck to get a</span> <span data-start="309.16" data-end="312.16">features ground out right I but security</span> <span data-start="312.16" data-end="315.58">is one of those constraints that that</span> <span data-start="315.58" data-end="317.35">has to be filtered into that sort of</span> <span data-start="317.35" data-end="321.13">equation so who is responsible for</span> <span data-start="321.13" data-end="326.169">security anyone want to take a guess you</span> <span data-start="326.169" data-end="333.76">are sorry but you need to be up to the</span> <span

the ones building it it's time to</span> <span data-start="344.41" data-end="348.82">take some responsibility for this I was</span> <span data-start="348.82" data-end="350.65">talking to the martine before the talk</span> <span data-start="350.65" data-end="352.87">and as a developer if you if you don't</span> <span data-start="352.87" data-end="355">care about security but others care</span> <span data-start="355" data-end="356.44">about security in your organization or</span> <span data-start="356.44" data-end="358.169">that deal with that software your</span> <span data-start="358.169"

so I'm going</span> <span data-start="530.89" data-end="532.33">to tell you about the story of and yet</span> <span data-start="532.33" data-end="536.86">and how I came to be at and yet and how</span> <span data-start="536.86" data-end="541.81">we handle security at and yet basically</span> <span data-start="541.81" data-end="544.39">how I was a seed crystal in and yet and</span> <span

data-start="569.29" data-end="571.69">ingenuity and basically a single person</span> <span data-start="571.69" data-end="573.91">consultancy to two of us and he was</span> <span data-start="573.91" data-end="575.5">running a web development shop and we</span> <span data-start="575.5" data-end="577.96">realized very early on that it was a</span> <span data-start="577.96" data-end="581.17">very symbiotic relationship I could help</span> <span data-start="581.17" data-end="584.41">him grow and build his business and it</span> <span data-start="584.41" data-end="586.77">meant a business from for me as well</span> <span data-start="586.77" data-end="589.99">it's old contracts for him to have a</span> <span data-start="589.99" data-end="593.05">partnership with with security showing</span>

data-end="607.69">started there and so I would tell him</span> <span data-start="607.69" data-end="609.43">about you know hey you wrote this and</span> <span data-start="609.43" data-end="611.2">you did this you did this wrong right</span> <span data-start="611.2" data-end="613.54">all intensive purposes and so I taught</span> <span data-start="613.54" data-end="615.46">him so early on when I was him but as we</span> <span data-start="615.46" data-end="617.77">started to add people I was still this</span> <span data-start="617.77" data-end="620.59">external entity right and so as he added</span> <span data-start="620.59" data-end="622.27">people they write code and I'd review it</span> <span data-start="622.27" data-end="626.44">and as we moved along their people</span> <span
