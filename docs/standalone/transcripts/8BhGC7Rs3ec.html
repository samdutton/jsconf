that is what I do the history</span> <span data-start="74.62" data-end="76.27">of dojo and this is this is the exciting</span> <span data-start="76.27" data-end="77.82">i only have three slides i swear to god</span> <span data-start="77.82" data-end="80.92">it was started by this guy alex russell</span> <span data-start="80.92" data-end="83.32">and if you've never gotten a cease and</span>

data-end="89.8">windows in it and that's what dojo</span> <span data-start="89.8" data-end="92.29">started as essentially it was started as</span> <span data-start="92.29" data-end="95.5">a net windows turned into a foundation</span> <span data-start="95.5" data-end="98.71">of a couple of javascript hackers that</span> <span data-start="98.71" data-end="101.32">had a unified vision for just JavaScript</span> <span data-start="101.32" data-end="104.649">let's make an API let's make a dojo</span> <span data-start="104.649" data-end="107.08">foundation where we can license this and</span> <span data-start="107.08" data-end="109.21">then the rest is history we've come into</span> <span data-start="109.21" data-end="113.14">we have 40 some-odd core committers that</span> <span data-start="113.14" data-end="115.75">are full-time dedicated to to the</span> <span data-start="115.75" data-end="118.78">betterment of dojo Dylan Chi Minh is the</span> <span data-start="118.78" data-end="121.36">founder of sight pen and one of the</span> <span data-start="121.36" data-end="123.759">original founders of the dojo foundation</span> <span data-start="123.759" data-end="130.09">so the what dojo is has changed today is</span> <span data-start="130.09" data-end="132.9">in fact dojos five year anniversary</span> <span data-start="132.9" data-end="136.93">today was the first day that the net</span> <span data-start="136.93" data-end="139.45">windows mailing list email went out five</span> <span data-start="139.45" data-end="141.94">years ago so that's kind of significant</span> <span data-start="141.94" data-end="144.61">in that wow it's been that long that's</span> <span data-start="144.61" data-end="148.93">amazing so we became a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="148.93" data-end="150.91">toolkit we're not anything a framework</span> <span data-start="150.91" data-end="154.48">or anything beyond tools lightweight</span> <span data-start="154.48" data-end="158.05">base starts at typically 26 k it can get</span> <span data-start="158.05" data-end="162.01">down as small as 6 k and somewhere on 17</span> <span data-start="162.01" data-end="164.53">k is another another variant for web kit</span> <span data-start="164.53" data-end="167.65">which is i'll explain later we're</span> <span data-start="167.65" data-end="169.03">probably going to hover right around the</span> <span data-start="169.03" data-end="172.9">30k mark in 1.4 because of a project</span> <span data-start="172.9" data-end="175.51">that i also do called plug d probably</span> <span data-start="175.51" data-end="177.55">should be pronounced plugged</span> <span data-start="177.55" data-end="180.13">but I call it plug d because I refused</span> <span data-start="180.13" data-end="182.38">to follow conventions so it's it's just</span> <span data-start="182.38" data-end="184.03">a use it will library it starts with</span> <span data-start="184.03" data-end="185.68">this small base and then you get all of</span> <span data-start="185.68" data-end="188.55">these extra components right like it's</span> <span data-start="188.55" data-end="190.93">everyone's familiar with XKCD right</span> <span data-start="190.93" data-end="194.02">right so dojo is to javascript like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194.02" data-end="197.5">Python in my humble opinion um it's like</span> <span data-start="197.5" data-end="199.93">you're flying I go you know err on the</span> <span data-start="199.93" data-end="201.58">side of the medicine cabinet comparison</span> <span data-start="201.58" data-end="204.01">thing but I think it's the Python but i</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="206.68">think it's the dojo really because it's</span> <span data-start="206.68" data-end="209.34">like flying if you want something you</span> <span data-start="209.34" data-end="213.13">just require it and it goes on and on</span> <span data-start="213.13" data-end="215.83">calendars there's a require for it and</span> <span data-start="215.83" data-end="217.72">it pulls it in file uploads everything</span> <span data-start="217.72" data-end="220.05">you could ever think that you wanted is</span> <span data-start="220.05" data-end="223.42">probably there you just don't know it</span> <span data-start="223.42" data-end="225.94">yet right it's partially the</span> <span data-start="225.94" data-end="228.22">documentation which is my first point on</span> <span data-start="228.22" data-end="230.86">what's wrong but it just goes on and on</span> <span data-start="230.86" data-end="234.31">there are so many wonderful components</span> <span data-start="234.31" data-end="237.63">in dojo that are just there so not only</span> <span data-start="237.63" data-end="239.98">it's it's not so much that you have to</span> <span data-start="239.98" data-end="243.04">use the the framework okay i think the</span> <span data-start="243.04" data-end="245.44">south park right have you seen the south</span> <span data-start="245.44" data-end="246.64">park where he's going around trying to</span> <span data-start="246.64" data-end="248.44">do something that the simpsons hasn't</span> <span data-start="248.44" data-end="252.489">done that's that's what dojo is really</span> <span data-start="252.489" data-end="254.47">it's we've been around so long we have</span> <span data-start="254.47" data-end="258.4">so much stuff that it's not necessarily</span> <span data-start="258.4" data-end="260.169">the best way to do it but it's there and</span> <span data-start="260.169" data-end="262.24">it's licensed it's free and you can use</span> <span data-start="262.24" data-end="263.71">it and you can take it and you can port</span> <span data-start="263.71" data-end="264.88">it and you can modify it and do whatever</span> <span data-start="264.88" data-end="267.34">you want but really consider looking at</span> <span data-start="267.34" data-end="269.44">it for nothing else other than to learn</span> <span data-start="269.44" data-end="271.57">the javascript because there's a huge</span> <span data-start="271.57" data-end="274.06">huge amount of talent that went into</span> <span data-start="274.06" data-end="278.05">this product so it adds up right go back</span> <span data-start="278.05" data-end="280.15">it adds up all of these modules that</span> <span data-start="280.15" data-end="282.22">you're that you're doing requiring in or</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="285.4">whatever our individual javascript files</span> <span data-start="285.4" data-end="287.89">and contradictory to the the performance</span> <span data-start="287.89" data-end="290.38">talk we saw earlier that's probably a</span> <span data-start="290.38" data-end="291.82">bad thing because its individual files</span> <span data-start="291.82" data-end="294.22">and its individual you know synchronous</span> <span data-start="294.22" data-end="297.49">requests out onto the server so the dojo</span> <span data-start="297.49" data-end="298.84">solution to that is the dojo build</span> <span data-start="298.84" data-end="300.45">system it's like an all-in-one</span> <span data-start="300.45" data-end="303.34">optimization kind of thing that happens</span> <span data-start="303.34" data-end="306.789">it starts works transparently with our</span> <span data-start="306.789" data-end="309.34">package system so when you don't require</span> <span data-start="309.34" data-end="310.6">something all of the</span> <span data-start="310.6" data-end="312.94">dependencies are tracked all of the all</span> <span data-start="312.94" data-end="315.43">of the modules are pulled in in order</span> <span data-start="315.43" data-end="317.29">dependencies within those modules are</span> <span data-start="317.29" data-end="319.33">tracked but when you build it all turns</span> <span data-start="319.33" data-end="321.76">it into one file you group the modules</span> <span data-start="321.76" data-end="322.87">into layers you group them into</span> <span data-start="322.87" data-end="325.21">optimized layers you can have like a</span> <span data-start="325.21" data-end="327.07">first layer and then an additive layer</span> <span data-start="327.07" data-end="328.63">that you lazy load after the

data-start="334.69" data-end="337.18">these optimize things we do it to CSS as</span> <span data-start="337.18" data-end="340.96">well within our themes are our widget UI</span> <span

data-end="351.67">will tell us is a horrible horrible way</span> <span data-start="351.67" data-end="355.12">to do anything but it works because it</span> <span data-start="355.12" data-end="357.52">works and then we import the ettes the</span> <span data-start="357.52" data-end="359.17">ad imports just like we do the requires</span> <span data-start="359.17"

data-start="574.99" data-end="577.99">that has all of the api's in it</span> <span data-start="577.99" data-end="580.209">but it's only 6k and then if you</span> <span data-start="580.209" data-end="581.62">actually call the api goes out and</span> <span data-start="581.62" data-end="583.18">fetches it and pulls it in and then you</span> <span data-start="583.18" data-end="585.73">can use it it's not for performance</span> <span data-start="585.73" data-end="587.38">reasons it's for size reasons you can</span> <span data-start="587.38" data-end="589.93">get it this gets under the the 6k or the</span> <span data-start="589.93" data-end="592.57">25k limit on the on the iPhone but it's</span> <span data-start="592.57" data-end="595.33">definitely not performance but you can</span> <span data-start="595.33" data-end="596.649">go the other way with it to base plus</span> <span data-start="596.649" data-end="600.01">plus you can roll extra code into dojo</span> <span data-start="600.01" data-end="602.47">j/s so your solution is a single file we</span> <span data-start="602.47" data-end="604.12">typically recommend you don't mess with</span> <span data-start="604.12" data-end="606.31">da jjs and leave it as a 26 and then do</span> <span data-start="606.31" data-end="608.29">your one layer on top of it but in stuff</span> <span data-start="608.29" data-end="610.3">like air or whatever you can really just</span> <span data-start="610.3" data-end="612.61">you know deploy a single javascript file</span> <span

data-end="618.279">which is awesome plug d is another</span> <span data-start="618.279" data-end="622.42">special build where I use I use the</span> <span data-start="622.42" data-end="625.39">ifdef stuff to conflict there's a</span> <span data-start="625.39" data-end="627.58">there's a I'll get into it a little bit</span> <span data-start="627.58" data-end="630.94">later but it automatically runs conflict</span> <span data-start="630.94" data-end="633.37">or dojo conflict scope burning as well</span> <span data-start="633.37" data-end="635.08">which is kind of interesting it's it's</span> <span data-start="635.08" data-end="637.63">our solution to running multiple dojos</span> <span data-start="637.63" data-end="638.95">in the same page which we've been able</span> <span data-start="638.95" data-end="642.82">to do since 1.1 we're currently at one</span> <span data-start="642.82" data-end="644.589">point three so it's been about a year</span> <span data-start="644.589" data-end="646.839">since we've been doing this but the</span> <span data-start="646.839" data-end="649.75">scope burning you can remap the dojo</span> <span data-start="649.75" data-end="652.779">namespace on the fly or on page load to</span> <span data-start="652.779" data-end="654.339">something else you can be like mojo or</span> <span data-start="654.339" data-end="656.709">whatever you want to do based on just</span> <span data-start="656.709" data-end="658.75">making a build and then you just access</span> <span data-start="658.75" data-end="661.39">the api's that way and it works</span> <span data-start="661.39" data-end="665.23">transparently um so I used scope burning</span> <span data-start="665.23" data-end="666.399">to do something really really cool</span> <span data-start="666.399" data-end="670.57">called mujo and it's kind of funny it</span> <span data-start="670.57" data-end="672.82">doesn't look anything like dojo it was</span> <span data-start="672.82" data-end="675.76">me working with the the mootools team</span> <span data-start="675.76" data-end="679.99">joking around one day and this is this</span> <span data-start="679.99" data-end="682.54">is dojo code this is a automatically all</span> <span data-start="682.54" data-end="684.07">you do is have to load there's a link I</span> <span data-start="684.07" data-end="686.85">don't know if you can really read it</span> <span data-start="686.85" data-end="689.91">it's on my my sandbox link that was</span> <span data-start="689.91" data-end="694.779">originally on the thing but it's dojo</span> <span data-start="694.779" data-end="697.29">places the real API so this is using a</span> <span data-start="697.29" data-end="701.47">special ifdef to allow a function to be</span> <span data-start="701.47" data-end="703.24">called when you load the page to export</span> <span data-start="703.24" data-end="704.829">all of the dojo namespaces into the</span> <span data-start="704.829" data-end="706.75">window object which is not something</span> <span data-start="706.75" data-end="709.209">dojo would do but it's something dojo</span> <span data-start="709.209" data-end="709.72">could do</span> <span data-start="709.72" data-end="713.439">so it actually it speeds it up</span> <span data-start="713.439" data-end="716.529">considerably um things on the window and</span> <span data-start="716.529" data-end="718.48">ie are probably the fastest way to</span> <span data-start="718.48" data-end="720.279">access them it turns out and I'll get</span> <span data-start="720.279" data-end="722.589">into that in a second um and that's what</span> <span data-start="722.589" data-end="726.49">the the ifdef stuff looks like exclude</span> <span data-start="726.49" data-end="728.529">start and then if you pass an auto</span> <span data-start="728.529" data-end="730.269">conflict into your profile that</span> <span data-start="730.269" data-end="732.759">everything in between the exclude start</span> <span data-start="732.759" data-end="736.079">and stop based on the tag is removed so</span> <span data-start="736.079" data-end="738.899">normally you have this conditional</span> <span data-start="738.899" data-end="740.98">conditional thing but you know if you're</span> <span data-start="740.98" data-end="742.36">if you're building it especially and you</span> <span data-start="742.36" data-end="743.8">know what you're doing then it does it</span> <span data-start="743.8" data-end="745.089">for you automatically and then dojo</span> <span data-start="745.089" data-end="749.56">export NS is a plug d plugin which maps</span> <span data-start="749.56" data-end="752.23">from one to the other dojo global is the</span> <span data-start="752.23" data-end="754.75">window but we use dojo global so we can</span> <span data-start="754.75" data-end="757.899">switch it in different environments um</span> <span data-start="757.899" data-end="761.56">and mujo introduced something very very</span> <span data-start="761.56" data-end="766.149">interesting uh that I i put mujo in with</span> <span data-start="766.149" data-end="769.24">the dojo speed test and mujo beats dojo</span> <span data-start="769.24" data-end="772.209">for whatever reason it's it's it's</span> <span data-start="772.209" data-end="775.24">faster than then dojo which is</span> <span data-start="775.24" data-end="777.79">incredible um but it is and it's the</span> <span data-start="777.79" data-end="779.319">same reason i had i had plugged in here</span> <span data-start="779.319" data-end="781.75">as well just to test because plug d does</span> <span data-start="781.75" data-end="785.05">a little bit of magic to dojo that even</span> <span data-start="785.05" data-end="786.759">dojo wouldn't necessarily agree with but</span> <span data-start="786.759" data-end="789.759">um i like it and i use it so i've done</span> <span data-start="789.759" data-end="791.74">it and i'm the project lead of dojo and</span> <span data-start="791.74" data-end="793.42">i'm working on getting it back into its</span> <span data-start="793.42"

that we just can't break</span> <span data-start="800.649" data-end="804.22">so especially in the dot releases in 1.4</span> <span data-start="804.22" data-end="805.72">we'll probably see a lot of the

<span data-start="814.72" data-end="817.36">that was interesting so we put mujo in</span> <span data-start="817.36" data-end="820">here it was even faster but it totally</span> <span data-start="820" data-end="823.48">comes down to the object association</span> <span data-start="823.48" data-end="825.37">look up which i'll be talking about more</span> <span data-start="825.37"
