weird topic my name is Anna I like</span> <span data-start="18.6" data-end="20.4">to talk about computer games</span> <span data-start="20.4" data-end="22.35">role-playing games and theoretical</span> <span data-start="22.35" data-end="25.17">computer science so just one topic was</span> <span data-start="25.17" data-end="27.09">fitting for the conference so I went</span> <span data-start="27.09" data-end="29.4">with theoretical computer science I'm</span> <span data-start="29.4" data-end="31.98">here today to talk to you about one of</span> <span data-start="31.98" data-end="33.93">my secret passions which is complexity</span> <span data-start="33.93" data-end="36.63">theory and I'm going to give you a short</span> <span data-start="36.63" data-end="38.67">introduction to computational complexity</span> <span data-start="38.67" data-end="41.16">so I'm not going to talk about time or</span> <span data-start="41.16" data-end="43.2">space complexity if you already have an</span> <span data-start="43.2" data-end="46.23">idea what this is I will use a very</span> <span data-start="46.23" data-end="48.66">made-up real-world example to help you</span> <span data-start="48.66" data-end="49.95">understand what I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="49.95" data-end="54.27">so let's go picture this for a moment</span> <span data-start="54.27" data-end="56.25">you are volunteering at an animal</span> <span data-start="56.25" data-end="59.579">shelter the shelter has cats dogs</span> <span data-start="59.579" data-end="63.899">turtles you and your weird manager the</span> <span data-start="63.899" data-end="67.02">manager is weird because she sets up</span> <span data-start="67.02" data-end="70.049">arbitrary rules for you and other people</span> <span data-start="70.049" data-end="75.479">to follow you are in charge of the</span> <span data-start="75.479" data-end="77.64">petting process over viewing the petting</span> <span data-start="77.64" data-end="79.439">process so visitors come to your shelter</span> <span data-start="79.439" data-end="82.259">and want to have pet animals and you</span> <span data-start="82.259" data-end="83.64">have to make sure they follow the</span> <span data-start="83.64" data-end="85.82">petting rules</span> <span data-start="85.82" data-end="90.119">each rule is different every day so on</span> <span data-start="90.119" data-end="95.1">your first day the rule is the visitors</span> <span data-start="95.1" data-end="98.189">cannot pet two cats or two dogs in a row</span> <span data-start="98.189" data-end="100.29">they're not allowed to touch the turtles</span> <span data-start="100.29" data-end="103.32">just for completion but this is through</span> <span data-start="103.32" data-end="106.14">so visitors come in may go pet the</span> <span data-start="106.14" data-end="108.479">animals they come to you and say well I</span> <span data-start="108.479" data-end="111.78">pet it a cat a dog a cat and a cat and</span> <span data-start="111.78" data-end="113.939">you have to decide for example if there</span> <span data-start="113.939" data-end="115.86">was a valid petting sequence or not if</span> <span data-start="115.86" data-end="117.84">they're good visitors or bad visitors</span> <span data-start="117.84" data-end="120.899">you know stuff you have to do you're an</span> <span data-start="120.899" data-end="122.07">engineering you're just volunteering</span> <span data-start="122.07" data-end="123.81">there so after 20 visitors you think</span> <span data-start="123.81" data-end="126.75">like ah a machine could do this and so</span> <span data-start="126.75" data-end="130.53">you build one you start thinking about</span> <span data-start="130.53" data-end="133.43">the process so</span> <span data-start="133.43" data-end="135.92">the visitor comes in and wants to pet an</span> <span data-start="135.92" data-end="138.469">animal and they can either decide to pet</span> <span data-start="138.469" data-end="141.01">a cat or a dog</span> <span data-start="141.01" data-end="143.569">if after petting a cat</span> <span data-start="143.569" data-end="146.359">they pet another kid there are the bad</span> <span data-start="146.359" data-end="147.769">visitors and I'm not allowed to come</span> <span data-start="147.769" data-end="149.84">back same with the dog petting a dog</span> <span data-start="149.84" data-end="154.459">after dog but they're good if they pet</span> <span data-start="154.459" data-end="158.87">another animal this is a very simple</span> <span data-start="158.87" data-end="161.299">machine that can handle your daily tasks</span> <span data-start="161.299" data-end="164.84">to see if the visitors alternate in</span> <span data-start="164.84" data-end="169.639">petting animals this machine has a name</span> <span data-start="169.639" data-end="171.439">in theoretical computer science at the</span> <span data-start="171.439" data-end="173.599">computer science it's called finite</span> <span data-start="173.599" data-end="178.76">state automaton so the pictures were the</span> <span data-start="178.76" data-end="180.98">hand and the animals are so-called</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="180.98" data-end="183.62">States the arrows between them are</span> <span data-start="183.62" data-end="185.03">so-called transitions between those</span> <span data-start="185.03" data-end="191.12">states this is a very simplified version</span> <span data-start="191.12" data-end="193.31">of what that is so if you never seen</span> <span data-start="193.31" data-end="196.04">anything like this because you don't</span> <span data-start="196.04" data-end="197.78">have a computer science education that's</span> <span data-start="197.78" data-end="199.19">basically the rough idea that you just</span> <span data-start="199.19" data-end="202.099">need to follow so you think you're good</span> <span data-start="202.099" data-end="203.84">and you're good for a couple of days but</span> <span data-start="203.84" data-end="206.709">then your manager changes the rule and</span> <span data-start="206.709" data-end="211.849">they say well the visitors first must</span> <span data-start="211.849" data-end="214.04">pet a specific number of cats and then</span> <span data-start="214.04" data-end="215.65">the same number of dogs</span> <span data-start="215.65" data-end="220.01">thank you again you sit there you want</span> <span data-start="220.01" data-end="222.259">to work but also you want to have time</span> <span data-start="222.259" data-end="223.909">to pet the animals yourself so you think</span> <span data-start="223.909" data-end="226.31">well maybe I can just adjust my machine</span> <span data-start="226.31" data-end="229.4">to do that work of checking the petting</span> <span data-start="229.4" data-end="232.43">sequences for me and you think about</span> <span data-start="232.43" data-end="235.729">that so you can start work petting</span> <span data-start="235.729" data-end="236.87">something if you pet a dog in the</span> <span data-start="236.87" data-end="240.049">beginning you're out that visitor but if</span> <span data-start="240.049" data-end="244.159">you pet a cat you can pet a lot of cats</span> <span data-start="244.159" data-end="247.34">and then you can switch to a dog and pet</span> <span data-start="247.34" data-end="250.879">a lot of dogs and if you're in the dog</span> <span data-start="250.879" data-end="254.959">stays if you cannot pet a cat again and</span> <span data-start="254.959" data-end="257.389">you think yeah that's that's nice fish I</span> <span data-start="257.389" data-end="260.78">mean I know now that I can only pet care</span> <span data-start="260.78" data-end="262.82">before dogs and not alternating between</span> <span data-start="262.82" data-end="266.27">them but it's not giving me a check for</span> <span data-start="266.27" data-end="269.09">whether I pet the same number of animals</span> <span data-start="269.09" data-end="272.66">and you think of it and think maybe the</span> <span data-start="272.66" data-end="274.61">machine I'm using is just not powerful</span> <span data-start="274.61" data-end="277.76">enough to handle this constraint that</span> <span data-start="277.76" data-end="281.69">the manager gave me so we're introducing</span> <span data-start="281.69" data-end="283.91">a new part to our machine and it's</span> <span data-start="283.91" data-end="287.12">called the stack the stack is really</span> <span data-start="287.12" data-end="290.33">like a stack of books you can put stuff</span> <span data-start="290.33" data-end="292.7">on top of it and you can put you can</span> <span data-start="292.7" data-end="296.18">take stuff from the top that's all it</span> <span data-start="296.18" data-end="298.01">can do so you cannot grab something from</span> <span data-start="298.01" data-end="300.38">the middle or from the bottom because it</span> <span data-start="300.38" data-end="303.02">will collapse and will not work I think</span> <span data-start="303.02" data-end="305.87">okay maybe that's already enough so we</span> <span data-start="305.87" data-end="307.7">go back to our machine which is not</span> <span data-start="307.7" data-end="310.78">working and we introduce the stack to it</span> <span data-start="310.78" data-end="314.27">so whenever we pet a cat we put a cat</span> <span data-start="314.27" data-end="317.479">token on the stack and whenever we put a</span> <span data-start="317.479" data-end="319.91">dog we remove a dog a cat token from the</span> <span data-start="319.91" data-end="325.04">sec so if this the cats and the dogs are</span> <span data-start="325.04" data-end="327.41">the same number the stack will be empty</span> <span data-start="327.41" data-end="329.3">in the end that we're good it was a good</span> <span data-start="329.3" data-end="333.35">visit or if there is a cat left it's bad</span> <span data-start="333.35" data-end="335.99">visitor if we want to take away a cat</span> <span data-start="335.99" data-end="338.27">and there's no cat there although we</span> <span data-start="338.27" data-end="340.55">have pet at a talk and it's also an</span> <span data-start="340.55" data-end="342.53">envelop petting sequence and the visitor</span> <span data-start="342.53" data-end="346.61">is a bad visitor this machine is called</span> <span data-start="346.61" data-end="351.35">a pushdown automaton so the push down is</span> <span data-start="351.35" data-end="353.75">just pushing stuff on the stack and the</span> <span data-start="353.75" data-end="355.49">stack is endless is like it's a deep</span> <span data-start="355.49" data-end="359.51">cellar with no end that doesn't matter</span> <span data-start="359.51" data-end="361.43">to you how deep it is it's just you can</span> <span data-start="361.43" data-end="363.47">use as much assist of you want if you as</span> <span data-start="363.47" data-end="370.01">much of it as you want remember that</span> <span data-start="370.01" data-end="371.57">this is just a theoretical models are</span> <span data-start="371.57" data-end="375.13">like no computers having infinite space</span> <span data-start="375.13" data-end="377.3">and again you're good for a couple of</span> <span data-start="377.3" data-end="381.229">days but then there's another rule the</span> <span data-start="381.229" data-end="383.87">rule change again changes again so again</span> <span data-start="383.87" data-end="385.76">we have to pet the same number of cats</span> <span data-start="385.76" data-end="388.729">as dogs but now introducing the Turtles</span> <span data-start="388.729" data-end="391.45">we weren't allowed to touch before and</span> <span data-start="391.45" data-end="393.83">then thinking again well how are we</span> <span data-start="393.83" data-end="394.66">going to</span> <span data-start="394.66" data-end="398.47">this with our stick you know it's now</span> <span data-start="398.47" data-end="400.63">not just two types of animals but three</span> <span data-start="400.63" data-end="403">so it just cannot take stuff from the</span> <span data-start="403" data-end="405.7">top and put stuff on the top we somehow</span> <span data-start="405.7" data-end="408.18">have to take into account the turtles</span> <span data-start="408.18" data-end="411.88">now so we need a new formalism a new</span> <span data-start="411.88" data-end="414.49">mechanism so we did just the stack and</span> <span data-start="414.49" data-end="419.44">introduced the tape a tape is the number</span> <span data-start="419.44" data-end="422.32">of cells and every cell can be accessed</span> <span data-start="422.32" data-end="424.63">and modified so in the beginning we have</span> <span data-start="424.63" data-end="426.22">the stack and we couldn't take stuff out</span> <span data-start="426.22" data-end="429.28">of the middle we can do this now we can</span> <span data-start="429.28" data-end="432.49">read each cell we can modify itself</span> <span data-start="432.49" data-end="434.59">the only restriction we have now saying</span> <span data-start="434.59" data-end="439.93">okay the lengths of the tape is just the</span> <span data-start="439.93" data-end="442.62">number of animals petted nothing more</span> <span data-start="442.62" data-end="445.38">that's it about these are the bounds</span> <span data-start="445.38" data-end="448.96">let's see if we can work with that</span> <span data-start="448.96" data-end="451.95">this tape is a so-called restricted tape</span> <span data-start="451.95" data-end="456.67">so our our input will again be in number</span> <span data-start="456.67" data-end="458.65">of family Mel's two cats two dogs two</span> <span data-start="458.65" data-end="462.58">turtles I spare you the state transition</span> <span data-start="462.58" data-end="464.64">diagram because it will get confusing</span> <span data-start="464.64" data-end="467.83">starting with this machine but the idea</span> <span data-start="467.83" data-end="470.86">is the following so whenever you see a</span> <span data-start="470.86" data-end="474.97">cat you walk on the tape until to the</span> <span data-start="474.97" data-end="477.64">right until you find a dog and then</span> <span data-start="477.64" data-end="480.4">until you find the turtle and then you</span> <span data-start="480.4" data-end="482.95">stop again go back to the beginning of</span> <span data-start="482.95" data-end="485.02">the tape and look for the first kid and</span> <span data-start="485.02" data-end="490.75">go on so if at the end of the cat's</span> <span data-start="490.75" data-end="494.62">their only access on the tape it's a</span>

data-end="1123.89">hand but but knowing like well JSON</span> <span data-start="1123.89" data-end="1126.86">schema is is more expressive than that</span> <span data-start="1126.86" data-end="1130.43">and I like working with JSON schema you</span> <span data-start="1130.43" data-end="1132.35">can use JSON schema to to handle the</span> <span data-start="1132.35" data-end="1137.68">task of the finished state automaton</span> <span data-start="1137.68" data-end="1140">some people say well you should always</span> <span data-start="1140" data-end="1145.31">use the machine the most easiest the</span> <span data-start="1145.31" data-end="1149.99">easiest machine for the job but it's not</span> <span data-start="1149.99" data-end="1153.29">really worth losing sleep over how to</span> <span data-start="1153.29" data-end="1155.66">implement the most the best machine if</span> <span data-start="1155.66" data-end="1157.64">your curl machine is doing the job so</span> <span data-start="1157.64" data-end="1162.12">you're not really using losing too much</span> <span data-start="1162.13" data-end="1164.24">performance or anything if you do it</span> <span data-start="1164.24" data-end="1167.48">right and another thing that's really</span> <span data-start="1167.48" data-end="1168.71">really helpful if you know that is</span> <span data-start="1168.71" data-end="1174.32">avoiding pork so I'll show you again the</span> <span data-start="1174.32" data-end="1178.85">rule our manager put last pairing stops</span> <span data-start="1178.85" data-end="1181.79">after 2000 animals and other rules now</span> <span data-start="1181.79" data-end="1184.13">you know what as long as they stop</span> <span data-start="1184.13" data-end="1188.15">petting at any point we're good</span> <span data-start="1188.15" data-end="1189.92">and remember you have to decide</span> <span data-start="1189.92" data-end="1191.99">beforehand or not if they're going to</span> <span data-start="1191.99" data-end="1194.81">stop or not and we have the example that</span> <span data-start="1194.81" data-end="1196.79">they're just going to increase the</span> <span data-start="1196.79" data-end="1198.74">number of pet animals every step and</span> <span data-start="1198.74" data-end="1201.2">just imagining that humans can pet for</span> <span data-start="1201.2" data-end="1203.33">infinite amount of time it would be</span> <span data-start="1203.33" data-end="1204.8">really hard to check if they were going</span> <span data-start="1204.8" data-end="1207.59">to step to stop at any point or not and</span> <span data-start="1207.59" data-end="1210.02">that's what the machine says well like</span> <span data-start="1210.02" data-end="1214.52">that's not compute I can you know I can</span> <span data-start="1214.52" data-end="1219.32">decide I can say so if the petting stops</span> <span data-start="1219.32" data-end="1221.12">at any point if it does but if it does</span> <span data-start="1221.12" data-end="1222.92">not I'm not sure because it could step</span> <span data-start="1222.92" data-end="1225.41">stop in the next step or in the step</span> <span data-start="1225.41" data-end="1228.32">after that so if you're able to</span> <span data-start="1228.32" data-end="1231.64">correctly identify which is the problems</span> <span data-start="1231.64" data-end="1234.86">if they're solvable or not it can help</span> <span data-start="1234.86" data-end="1236.72">you avoid some work you know and then</span> <span data-start="1236.72" data-end="1239.99">you can just say no ie I couldn't find</span> <span data-start="1239.99" data-end="1241.55">an efficient algorithm or an algorithm</span> <span data-start="1241.55" data-end="1244.52">at all that solves that problem but I</span> <span data-start="1244.52" data-end="1250.31">could those famous people in my yeah in</span> <span data-start="1250.31" data-end="1253.01">my surroundings or in history at all so</span> <span data-start="1253.01" data-end="1255.32">this is what's computational complexity</span> <span data-start="1255.32" data-end="1260.26">about there are different formalisms</span> <span data-start="1260.26" data-end="1263.06">that describe different sets of</span> <span data-start="1263.06" data-end="1265.31">languages and some formalisms are more</span> <span data-start="1265.31" data-end="1266.18">powerful than others</span> <span data-start="1266.18" data-end="1268.58">and knowing how they connect and how</span> <span data-start="1268.58" data-end="1270.65">they relate to each other can help you</span> <span data-start="1270.65" data-end="1272">make your life a bit easier as a</span> <span data-start="1272" data-end="1273.95">developer so thank you very much that</span> <span data-start="1273.95" data-end="1275.39">was it</span> <span data-start="1275.39" data-end="1284.35">[Applause]</span> </p>
