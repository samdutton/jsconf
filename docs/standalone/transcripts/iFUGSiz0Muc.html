data-end="216.599">this is it you guys are going to get it</span> <span data-start="216.599" data-end="219.329">straight on i'm going to talk to you</span> <span data-start="219.329" data-end="220.739">about all the different cool things that</span> <span data-start="220.739" data-end="223.2">come directly from animation that i've</span> <span data-start="223.2" data-end="224.94">been using and we're going to start with</span> <span data-start="224.94" data-end="227.43">storyboards now this is a picture I took</span> <span data-start="227.43" data-end="229.26">and I'm sorry about the glare they had a</span> <span data-start="229.26" data-end="230.97">lot of LCDs in this room but this is</span> <span data-start="230.97" data-end="233.209">from the walt disney family museum in</span> <span data-start="233.209" data-end="235.919">california and this is an example of one</span> <span data-start="235.919" data-end="237.81">of the world's very first storyboards</span> <span data-start="237.81" data-end="240.959">storyboards are a recent invention back</span> <span data-start="240.959" data-end="243.48">in the olden days when disney was just</span> <span data-start="243.48" data-end="244.859">making little shorts that played before</span> <span data-start="244.859" data-end="246.989">movies they would have a couple of</span> <span data-start="246.989" data-end="248.79">animators that go off into their own</span> <span data-start="248.79" data-end="250.319">rooms and they work on their things</span> <span data-start="250.319" data-end="252.06">separately and then they come back</span> <span data-start="252.06" data-end="253.53">together and it's like I've got a gag</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="253.53" data-end="255.359">I've got a gag and they'd stitch them</span> <span data-start="255.359" data-end="257.82">together and then they play that before</span> <span data-start="257.82" data-end="259.169">a movie and that was all very well and</span> <span data-start="259.169" data-end="261.989">good until they cited to work on Snow</span> <span data-start="261.989" data-end="264.18">White you can have people wandering off</span> <span data-start="264.18" data-end="265.83">into their separate little coding holes</span> <span data-start="265.83" data-end="266.28">I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="266.28" data-end="268.96">animation tables and working on</span> <span data-start="268.96" data-end="270.52">individual projects and then coming</span> <span data-start="270.52" data-end="272.38">together because you know this dance</span> <span data-start="272.38" data-end="273.94">sequence isn't going to flow into that</span> <span data-start="273.94" data-end="276.21">dwarf sequence at all so they invented</span> <span data-start="276.21" data-end="278.73">storyboards which were just</span> <span data-start="278.73" data-end="280.66">illustrations like this pinned to cork</span> <span data-start="280.66" data-end="282.67">boards that they could lift up and haul</span> <span data-start="282.67" data-end="285.82">over to another studio plop down and let</span> <span data-start="285.82" data-end="288.73">new set of animators work on it so</span> <span data-start="288.73" data-end="291.43">anytime you needed to work with time and</span> <span data-start="291.43" data-end="294.67">talent it really helped I like to think</span> <span data-start="294.67" data-end="296.08">of it as prototyping with the fourth</span> <span data-start="296.08" data-end="298.83">dimension that is the dimension of time</span> <span data-start="298.83" data-end="302.35">so now these storyboards are used not</span> <span data-start="302.35" data-end="303.79">only in animation but they're used in</span> <span data-start="303.79" data-end="305.44">film they're using an interaction design</span> <span data-start="305.44" data-end="307.15">we use them in comics anything that</span> <span data-start="307.15" data-end="308.95">involves times and teams it's good idea</span> <span data-start="308.95" data-end="311.11">to bring our storyboard here's an</span> <span data-start="311.11" data-end="313.66">example of a storyboard I used for a</span> <span

was the only</span> <span data-start="329.95" data-end="331.9">person on this team but I still found it</span> <span data-start="331.9" data-end="333.64">very useful to have all of this</span> <span data-start="333.64" data-end="336.31">information at my fingertips and I'll</span> <span data-start="336.31" data-end="337.78">actually show you guys the music video</span> <span data-start="337.78" data-end="340.63">this is all by the way css3 animations</span> <span data-start="340.63" data-end="382.08">and html5 audio hang on</span> <span data-start="382.09" data-end="384.46">and it just loops
