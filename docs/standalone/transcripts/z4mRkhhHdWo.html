<p><span data-start="8.49" data-end="11.02">today I want to talk about designing</span> <span data-start="11.02" data-end="13">even larger</span> <span data-start="13" data-end="15.55">is actually a sequel to talk I gave a</span> <span data-start="15.55" data-end="18.36">jessica of Australia two years ago and</span> <span data-start="18.36" data-end="21.43">just like that last time I want to kind</span> <span data-start="21.43" data-end="24.22">of ground this talk in our career</span> <span data-start="24.22" data-end="26.29">progression as software engineers</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.29" data-end="28.3">I think many of you in the audience</span> <span data-start="28.3" data-end="30.22">would maybe call yourself a senior self</span> <span data-start="30.22" data-end="32.71">engineer or if you're not there yet you</span> <span data-start="32.71" data-end="35.47">aspire to be one and so the way I would</span> <span data-start="35.47" data-end="37.33">describe what it means to be seen</span> <span data-start="37.33" data-end="39.58">yourself engineer is that if someone</span> <span data-start="39.58" data-end="41.86">comes to me and they say like hey you</span> <span data-start="41.86" data-end="43.809">know I'm out to do this project in this</span> <span data-start="43.809" data-end="45.67">domain that you already filming you with</span> <span data-start="45.67" data-end="47.92">you would say yeah that's actually</span> <span data-start="47.92" data-end="49.36">something I know how to do I don't need</span> <span data-start="49.36" data-end="51.16">to need anyone else's help</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="51.16" data-end="53.14">I'm a senior person I know how to do it</span> <span data-start="53.14" data-end="55.84">and then this was kind of the series of</span> <span data-start="55.84" data-end="58.239">my last remark was going beyond that and</span> <span data-start="58.239" data-end="60.399">with that software engineering lens but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="60.399" data-end="62.32">I'm not talking so much about people but</span> <span data-start="62.32" data-end="65.229">still you kind of transcend beyond</span> <span data-start="65.229" data-end="66.64">yourself right it doesn't</span> <span data-start="66.64" data-end="68.53">the only looking at solving problems</span> <span data-start="68.53" data-end="71.05">yourself you're looking at how can i as</span> <span data-start="71.05" data-end="72.91">a software engineer anticipate our</span> <span data-start="72.91" data-end="74.649">others two things and then design api's</span> <span data-start="74.649" data-end="76.149">accordingly so that they are more</span> <span data-start="76.149" data-end="77.71">successful right so I think that is</span> <span data-start="77.71" data-end="80.77">really beyond seniority in this talk</span> <span data-start="80.77" data-end="83.89">today I want to go one level beyond that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="83.89" data-end="86.979">I want to breach this stage where I can</span> <span data-start="86.979" data-end="90.34">say I can design software such that for</span> <span data-start="90.34" data-end="92.799">loops of engineers the probability</span> <span data-start="92.799" data-end="95.2">increases that the suffer that they</span> <span data-start="95.2" data-end="98.47">produce is good now there are three key</span> <span data-start="98.47" data-end="100.33">words here first of all large groups of</span> <span data-start="100.33" data-end="102.159">engineers so if you're working to</span> <span data-start="102.159" data-end="103.93">startup or like a three-person company</span> <span data-start="103.93" data-end="106.03">then this talk may seem superfluous</span> <span data-start="106.03" data-end="109.27">boring and extra like not something you</span> <span data-start="109.27" data-end="111.369">care about but I think many of you may</span> <span data-start="111.369" data-end="114.369">be working insurance companies bangs or</span> <span data-start="114.369" data-end="116.619">anything right like wherever you have a</span> <span data-start="116.619" data-end="119.079">bunch of folks and multiple teams and</span> <span data-start="119.079" data-end="119.86">you kind of kinda need to coordinate</span> <span data-start="119.86" data-end="122.68">stuff then I'm talking about probability</span> <span data-start="122.68" data-end="124.659">there's no security here right you can</span> <span data-start="124.659" data-end="126.909">only try to set things up so they'll</span> <span data-start="126.909" data-end="129.79">probably work but there's no guarantees</span> <span data-start="129.79" data-end="132.76">there's no silver bullets finally I want</span> <span data-start="132.76" data-end="135.37">to talk about good stuff here so this is</span> <span data-start="135.37" data-end="136.959">not a product management</span> <span data-start="136.959" data-end="138.94">all right this talk will not help you</span> <span data-start="138.94" data-end="141.97">write the right program but it will help</span> <span data-start="141.97" data-end="145.18">you write that program good so what I</span> <span data-start="145.18" data-end="147.58">mean is it being maintainable high</span> <span data-start="147.58" data-end="149.68">performance having low buck density</span> <span data-start="149.68" data-end="151.9">being delivered on time that type of</span> <span data-start="151.9" data-end="153.4">stuff right these qualities that</span> <span data-start="153.4" data-end="155.98">transcend the product aspect of software</span> <span data-start="155.98" data-end="159.55">engineering I want to clarify one more</span> <span data-start="159.55" data-end="161.05">thing I'm gonna say stuff like</span> <span data-start="161.05" data-end="164.14">frameworks software infrastructure other</span> <span data-start="164.14" data-end="165.91">stuff like that all the time I kind of</span> <span data-start="165.91" data-end="168.459">treat them interchangeably what I mean</span> <span data-start="168.459" data-end="171.55">is kind of suffer that we are building</span> <span data-start="171.55" data-end="173.89">that helps other people build better</span> <span data-start="173.89" data-end="176.41">software and what I would like you all</span> <span data-start="176.41" data-end="178.93">to kind of put your mind into like</span> <span data-start="178.93" data-end="180.64">you're the person in your company who's</span> <span data-start="180.64" data-end="183.79">responsible for kind of defining how</span> <span data-start="183.79" data-end="186.16">people write software and then write the</span> <span data-start="186.16" data-end="187.75">infrastructure the software that they</span> <span data-start="187.75" data-end="190.36">are using to write software and when I</span> <span data-start="190.36" data-end="192.31">say you build a framework but I don't</span> <span data-start="192.31" data-end="194.86">mean that you make your own react or</span> <span data-start="194.86" data-end="196.54">angular right maybe that's actually the</span> <span data-start="196.54" data-end="197.47">right way to do it but it's not</span> <span data-start="197.47" data-end="198.94">necessary right I think whenever you</span> <span data-start="198.94" data-end="202">have a larger set of teams you want to</span> <span data-start="202" data-end="203.5">kind of standardize how they build</span> <span data-start="203.5" data-end="205.209">applications and that kind of puts a</span> <span data-start="205.209" data-end="206.92">framework around how people buy build</span> <span data-start="206.92" data-end="209.019">applications so that's what I mean again</span> <span data-start="209.019" data-end="210.459">like think about you being the person</span> <span data-start="210.459" data-end="213.22">who's responsible for this and then this</span> <span data-start="213.22" data-end="216.01">talk is about how you are successful at</span> <span data-start="216.01" data-end="218.379">that job and I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="218.379" data-end="220.87">that in three chapters the first one I</span> <span data-start="220.87" data-end="222.67">call understanding the degree of</span> <span data-start="222.67" data-end="224.59">uncertainty then we're going to learn</span> <span data-start="224.59" data-end="227.769">how to solve all known problems and then</span> <span data-start="227.769" data-end="229.36">final are we going to learn about</span> <span data-start="229.36" data-end="232.569">deploying change cool let's dive right</span> <span data-start="232.569" data-end="234.64">in with our friends or in our Heisenberg</span> <span data-start="234.64" data-end="236.14">telling us that this is actually</span> <span data-start="236.14" data-end="237.629">impossible</span> <span data-start="237.629" data-end="239.65">understanding the degree of uncertainty</span> <span data-start="239.65" data-end="243.34">how far are we that what's actually</span> <span data-start="243.34" data-end="245.86">needed to be done is the thing that's</span> <span data-start="245.86" data-end="248.59">needed to be done that is absolutely key</span> <span data-start="248.59" data-end="250.51">for self engineering I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="250.51" data-end="253.06">about a technique to kind of understand</span> <span data-start="253.06" data-end="256.15">how well we understand things for that</span> <span data-start="256.15" data-end="258.459">we need to understand the problem space</span> <span data-start="258.459" data-end="260.26">really well and understand how well we</span> <span data-start="260.26" data-end="262.12">understand this sorry about the busy</span> <span data-start="262.12" data-end="263.919">slides these are just a few questions</span> <span data-start="263.919" data-end="266.59">basically and the answers aren't even</span> <span data-start="266.59" data-end="269.169">that important but ask yourself what is</span> <span data-start="269.169" data-end="271.12">what is it in the existing</span> <span data-start="271.12" data-end="272.919">infrastructure that your users and your</span> <span data-start="272.919" data-end="275.169">users or developers what are they</span> <span data-start="275.169" data-end="277">struggling with and how are they</span> <span data-start="277" data-end="279.31">struggling with it what is the class of</span> <span data-start="279.31" data-end="280.54">applications that folk</span> <span data-start="280.54" data-end="282.91">we'll built using your work and kind of</span> <span data-start="282.91" data-end="284.83">bra terms what are the trends in the</span> <span data-start="284.83" data-end="287.26">industry that influence what type of</span> <span data-start="287.26" data-end="289.12">software is probably going to be written</span> <span data-start="289.12" data-end="290.05">in the future</span> <span data-start="290.05" data-end="291.4">right because infrastructure is always</span> <span data-start="291.4" data-end="295.03">for future software now all of these you</span> <span data-start="295.03" data-end="298.09">know may sound like reading the tea</span> <span data-start="298.09" data-end="300.91">leaves but I think usually you know if</span> <span data-start="300.91" data-end="302.11">you've been doing this for a while you</span> <span data-start="302.11" data-end="304.24">actually might have answers and so the</span> <span data-start="304.24" data-end="307">key here is really you do this exercise</span> <span data-start="307" data-end="309.67">to understand like how well can you</span> <span data-start="309.67" data-end="311.56">answer this right that's really the key</span> <span data-start="311.56" data-end="313.39">like if this is like really easy and you</span> <span data-start="313.39" data-end="314.89">write it down and everything is clear</span> <span data-start="314.89" data-end="317.05">that's one side or the other side is</span> <span data-start="317.05" data-end="318.43">like no I actually have no idea how they</span> <span data-start="318.43" data-end="321.4">answer this question I know nothing even</span> <span data-start="321.4" data-end="323.59">more powerful than knowing what people</span> <span data-start="323.59" data-end="326.89">want to do is what they don't want to do</span> <span data-start="326.89" data-end="329.92">so these are non goals so what are non</span> <span data-start="329.92" data-end="332.26">goals non goals aren't you know let's</span> <span data-start="332.26" data-end="333.52">say you work for a manufacturing company</span> <span data-start="333.52" data-end="337.75">and you don't need to like build an</span> <span data-start="337.75" data-end="340.21">insurance piece of software right that's</span> <span data-start="340.21" data-end="341.02">not an ondol</span> <span data-start="341.02" data-end="342.61">that's ridiculous of course you don't</span> <span data-start="342.61" data-end="344.29">want to do this right an on goal is</span> <span data-start="344.29" data-end="346.39">something that it's actually super</span> <span data-start="346.39" data-end="348.28">reasonable and even likely that you want</span> <span data-start="348.28" data-end="349.63">to do it but you know you don't want to</span> <span data-start="349.63" data-end="351.7">do it right like it's not a requirement</span> <span data-start="351.7" data-end="354.88">and so this might even be more difficult</span> <span data-start="354.88" data-end="356.74">than answering and like if you if you're</span> <span data-start="356.74" data-end="358.81">able to answer these questions that can</span> <span data-start="358.81" data-end="361">be very powerful you know the degree of</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="364.78">uncertainty is low so why why is</span> <span data-start="364.78" data-end="367.54">uncertainty so so so important when</span> <span data-start="367.54" data-end="369.88">uncertainty is hot you're gonna have to</span> <span data-start="369.88" data-end="371.86">make trade-offs you need to be flexible</span> <span data-start="371.86" data-end="374.11">right you need to say okay I need to I</span> <span data-start="374.11" data-end="375.61">don't know whether I need to support</span> <span data-start="375.61" data-end="377.23">this so I better make it that it's</span> <span data-start="377.23" data-end="379.3">possible right and whenever you're in</span> <span data-start="379.3" data-end="380.38">that situation</span> <span data-start="380.38" data-end="382.78">you need to make trade-offs right so</span> <span data-start="382.78" data-end="385.96">trade-offs are situations where you need</span> <span data-start="385.96" data-end="388.39">to kind of square to things and make</span> <span data-start="388.39" data-end="390.43">them both possible and probably end up</span> <span data-start="390.43" data-end="391.57">with something that's not quite as</span> <span data-start="391.57" data-end="393.49">awesome is something that only needs do</span> <span data-start="393.49" data-end="396.88">one of those two things and the problem</span> <span data-start="396.88" data-end="400.81">with trade-offs is that they make stuff</span> <span data-start="400.81" data-end="403.21">difficult and when you have unnecessary</span> <span data-start="403.21" data-end="406.03">trade-offs that really breaks software</span> <span data-start="406.03" data-end="407.38">engineering like software engineering</span> <span data-start="407.38" data-end="409.72">hates unnecessary trade-off and it's the</span> <span data-start="409.72" data-end="412.12">root of all evil what is an example for</span> <span data-start="412.12" data-end="413.1">this let's say</span> <span data-start="413.1" data-end="415.68">in your company you built this</span> <span data-start="415.68" data-end="418.5">infrastructure for mobile apps and you</span> <span data-start="418.5" data-end="420.45">anticipate that you know if maybe the</span> <span data-start="420.45" data-end="422.13">salespeople they have old crappy Android</span> <span data-start="422.13" data-end="423.93">phones with low memory and so you need</span> <span data-start="423.93" data-end="425.73">to make it such that everything works in</span> <span data-start="425.73" data-end="427.56">the whole memory situation and to design</span> <span data-start="427.56" data-end="429.03">the software frameworks such as</span> <span data-start="429.03" data-end="431.19">everyone's going and like needs to kit</span> <span data-start="431.19" data-end="432.96">worry about memory and manage it and</span> <span data-start="432.96" data-end="435.12">like all that stuff right and then it</span> <span data-start="435.12" data-end="436.56">turns out your company goes and buys</span> <span data-start="436.56" data-end="437.79">never on your phone and that was</span> <span data-start="437.79" data-end="439.89">completely for nothing right that's an</span> <span data-start="439.89" data-end="441.36">unnecessary trade-off but it's now much</span> <span data-start="441.36" data-end="443.01">more difficult to write software in your</span> <span data-start="443.01" data-end="444.57">system because it's in theory possible</span> <span data-start="444.57" data-end="447.71">to run in these lower power devices and</span> <span data-start="447.71" data-end="450.03">so interestingly this is a bit of a</span> <span data-start="450.03" data-end="451.95">generalization of Donald Knuth famous</span> <span data-start="451.95" data-end="454.17">theorem premature optimization is the</span> <span data-start="454.17" data-end="454.83">root of all evil</span> <span data-start="454.83" data-end="456.75">right so premature optimization is just</span> <span data-start="456.75" data-end="458.73">a special case of an unnecessary</span> <span data-start="458.73" data-end="460.83">trade-off but it doesn't only have to be</span> <span data-start="460.83" data-end="463.11">about performance every time you make</span> <span data-start="463.11" data-end="464.52">your software do something that it</span> <span data-start="464.52" data-end="465.93">doesn't need to do you made an</span> <span data-start="465.93" data-end="468.15">unnecessary trade-off in the baseline of</span> <span data-start="468.15" data-end="469.62">software design that can be really</span> <span data-start="469.62" data-end="473.64">really fatal cool so I think that's a</span> <span data-start="473.64" data-end="475.23">bit of a web development conference I</span> <span data-start="475.23" data-end="476.82">wanted to have one slide about web</span> <span data-start="476.82" data-end="481.02">development we have been doing

always</span> <span data-start="538.83" data-end="540.54">going to be something that you don't</span> <span data-start="540.54" data-end="543.75">know and they need to be able to live in</span> <span data-start="543.75" data-end="545.92">that in that space</span> <span data-start="545.92" data-end="550.01">so the reason why it's so important to</span> <span data-start="550.01"

data-end="600.74">like that's that's bad so if you</span> <span data-start="600.74" data-end="603.77">understand how well you understand the</span> <span data-start="603.77" data-end="605.84">problem

data-end="675.86">find out whether that was a good change</span> <span data-start="675.86" data-end="678.95">right and there's on one hand you have</span> <span data-start="678.95" data-end="681.769">the super awesome hot coat really don't</span> <span data-start="681.769" data-end="683.839">su type everything updates on screen</span> <span data-start="683.839"

the the</span> <span data-start="693.589" data-end="695.6">range and I think probably many of you</span> <span data-start="695.6" data-end="697.76">can feel with me you've been somewhere</span> <span
