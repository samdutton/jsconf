<p><span data-start="93.329" data-end="94.619">I love discussing with people I'm just</span> <span data-start="94.619" data-end="96.06">really good at creating awkward</span> <span data-start="96.06" data-end="98.43">experiences with people really fun for</span> <span data-start="98.43" data-end="100.77">people more quad for me but you will see</span> <span data-start="100.77" data-end="103.259">that can be nice and I like just to do</span> <span data-start="103.259" data-end="106.02">some content warning so I'm using quite</span> <span data-start="106.02" data-end="107.79">a colorful language so please pardon my</span> <span data-start="107.79" data-end="110.159">french and there will be few videos</span> <span data-start="110.159" data-end="112.32">including one with really annoying sound</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="112.32" data-end="114.99">I'm really sensible to sound but I'm</span> <span data-start="114.99" data-end="117.149">really sorry in advance and usually my</span> <span

quite</span> <span data-start="127.049" data-end="128.67">intense but let's talk about readability</span> <span data-start="128.67" data-end="132.06">and first why and the main reason why</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="133.7">it's because I can</span> <span data-start="133.7" data-end="136.97">I have a permit saying that I can do</span> <span data-start="136.97" data-end="138.8">what I want and today with you it will</span> <span data-start="138.8" data-end="141.65">be about a really complex cognitive</span> <span data-start="141.65" data-end="144.2">process which is readability really</span> <span data-start="144.2" data-end="145.73">complex because even if most of the</span> <span data-start="145.73" data-end="147.17">people are doing this since the youngest</span> <span data-start="147.17" data-end="150.05">age it's an acquired skill like you need</span> <span data-start="150.05" data-end="152.21">to learn to know how to read and it's</span> <span data-start="152.21" data-end="154.04">not something easy because you need</span> <span data-start="154.04" data-end="156.95">first to learn the alphabet and then you</span> <span data-start="156.95" data-end="159.68">need to learn what is this kind weird</span> <span data-start="159.68" data-end="162.23">mix of letters together that are words</span> <span data-start="162.23" data-end="163.94">you need to learn morphology orthography</span> <span data-start="163.94" data-end="167.27">semantics phonology and once you have</span> <span data-start="167.27" data-end="169.46">all of that you can start learning like</span> <span data-start="169.46" data-end="172.97">languages and the issue is that it's not</span> <span data-start="172.97" data-end="176.54">a life long skill like you can get you</span> <span data-start="176.54" data-end="178.73">can acquire reading difficulties like in</span> <span data-start="178.73" data-end="180.62">your life it's not something you will</span> <span data-start="180.62" data-end="184.04">keep like until your lecture last day</span> <span data-start="184.04" data-end="186.98">and the thing is the web is many</span> <span data-start="186.98" data-end="189.65">text-based and aside of the web being</span> <span data-start="189.65" data-end="191.78">mainly text-based add the debate on burn</span> <span data-start="191.78" data-end="194.56">on a burn but I'm sorry it will be burn</span> <span data-start="194.56" data-end="198.68">so the thing is the texts that are</span> <span data-start="198.68" data-end="201.11">composing our website that is the root</span> <span data-start="201.11" data-end="202.79">element of our website is not accessible</span> <span data-start="202.79" data-end="205.01">because not everybody can read it and</span> <span data-start="205.01" data-end="207.8">outside of reading impairments there is</span> <span data-start="207.8" data-end="210.14">one good example I'm not English speaker</span> <span data-start="210.14" data-end="211.85">in native so English for me was</span> <span data-start="211.85" data-end="213.47">something I had to learn I was in front</span> <span data-start="213.47" data-end="214.67">of a lot of website and not</span> <span data-start="214.67" data-end="216.32">understanding one word of what people</span> <span data-start="216.32" data-end="218.93">attend to me I hope that today is better</span> <span data-start="218.93" data-end="220.55">and I can hear my English and you can</span> <span data-start="220.55" data-end="221.959">understand English and not sure about</span> <span data-start="221.959" data-end="226.519">myself but we will try to see so reading</span> <span data-start="226.519" data-end="229.07">is really important and it's now also in</span> <span data-start="229.07" data-end="230.69">the way card so in the guidelines for</span> <span data-start="230.69" data-end="232.67">accessibility it's one of the success</span> <span data-start="232.67" data-end="236.18">criteria it's saying a lot of stuff</span> <span data-start="236.18" data-end="238.43">because we cog but mainly the</span> <span data-start="238.43" data-end="240.92">information here is the fact that it's</span> <span data-start="240.92" data-end="244.16">about text pacing and that's one awful</span> <span data-start="244.16" data-end="246.08">thing because if you're taking just the</span> <span data-start="246.08" data-end="247.85">accessibility guidelines and if you're</span> <span data-start="247.85" data-end="250.01">doing the CSS or the JavaScript for your</span> <span data-start="250.01" data-end="251.81">accessibility form to make your website</span> <span data-start="251.81" data-end="253.76">accessible the only thing you have to be</span> <span data-start="253.76" data-end="256.72">careful about is text pacing and</span> <span data-start="256.72" data-end="258.68">unfortunately there is a lot of studies</span> <span data-start="258.68" data-end="260.45">on dyslexia showing that we don't care</span> <span data-start="260.45" data-end="262.82">about we don't care so much about tech</span> <span data-start="262.82" data-end="264.35">spacing that's not the most important</span> <span data-start="264.35" data-end="266.419">element but still that's the only one we</span> <span data-start="266.419" data-end="267.23">can measure</span> <span data-start="267.23" data-end="269.42">so light heart space between paragraphs</span> <span data-start="269.42" data-end="271.88">space between words and space between</span> <span data-start="271.88" data-end="275.93">letters really important and before</span> <span data-start="275.93" data-end="278.69">going on CSS and the phones I just</span> <span data-start="278.69" data-end="280.13">wanted to see with you</span> <span data-start="280.13" data-end="284.6">why readability through dyslexia and one</span> <span data-start="284.6" data-end="285.83">of the reason why is because in</span> <span data-start="285.83" data-end="287.84">accessibility as usual the idea is</span> <span data-start="287.84" data-end="289.85">always to help the most impaired people</span> <span data-start="289.85" data-end="291.89">to be able to help everybody if you're</span> <span data-start="291.89" data-end="294.26">solving issues for the people having the</span> <span data-start="294.26" data-end="296.63">highest and the cap in front of some</span> <span data-start="296.63" data-end="300.2">actions you can help everybody so it's a</span> <span data-start="300.2" data-end="302.6">same with readability dyslexia is one of</span> <span data-start="302.6" data-end="305.24">the most common reading impairment it's</span> <span data-start="305.24" data-end="307.19">more or less 10% of the population</span> <span data-start="307.19" data-end="311.24">worldwide 10% of the population it's</span> <span data-start="311.24" data-end="313.58">huge and in some countries in Europe</span> <span data-start="313.58" data-end="316.13">it's even worse in a way like for</span> <span data-start="316.13" data-end="318.02">example Scandinavian languages because</span> <span data-start="318.02" data-end="321.02">of the really big amount of vowels and</span> <span data-start="321.02" data-end="324.98">like sounds in the language they are</span> <span data-start="324.98" data-end="327.2">like up to 15 to 17 percent of the</span> <span data-start="327.2" data-end="330.89">population it's really a lot and the</span> <span data-start="330.89" data-end="332.96">thing is you can try to find this like</span> <span data-start="332.96" data-end="334.91">sick child but it's not always inside</span> <span data-start="334.91" data-end="336.5">childhood too because when you learn a</span> <span data-start="336.5" data-end="338.36">new language you're facing your sounds</span> <span data-start="338.36" data-end="340.22">you're facing new things that you did</span> <span data-start="340.22" data-end="342.71">not know because not part of your first</span> <span data-start="342.71" data-end="345.14">or second or third languages and this</span> <span data-start="345.14" data-end="346.91">can trigger also some kind of dyslexia</span> <span data-start="346.91" data-end="349.91">and finally because this sixth it's not</span> <span data-start="349.91" data-end="352.67">only about reading it's about a lot of</span> <span data-start="352.67" data-end="354.44">stuff happening in your mind in your</span> <span data-start="354.44" data-end="356.39">cognitive processes mainly about</span> <span data-start="356.39" data-end="360.83">problem-solving and this is impacting a</span> <span data-start="360.83" data-end="362.33">lot of the way not only revision</span> <span data-start="362.33" data-end="366.05">internet but we just navigate so how do</span> <span data-start="366.05" data-end="369.17">we read them the first thing is the fact</span> <span data-start="369.17" data-end="372.28">that reading is not so much about the</span> <span data-start="372.28" data-end="376.25">text it's about the sounds that we make</span> <span data-start="376.25" data-end="380">it's about the reason that we are having</span> <span data-start="380" data-end="382.07">when we're speaking it's about the music</span> <span data-start="382.07" data-end="385.34">that we're creating so when we are</span> <span data-start="385.34" data-end="387.8">reading a text even just for self</span> <span data-start="387.8" data-end="390.08">we are always hearing a voice that's the</span> <span data-start="390.08" data-end="392.75">way our brain is trying to make sense of</span> <span data-start="392.75" data-end="395.21">a texts you are hearing it to understand</span> <span data-start="395.21" data-end="397.22">it to understand it and that's really</span> <span data-start="397.22" data-end="400.97">important because this voice will impact</span> <span data-start="400.97" data-end="403.76">sometimes even more than the word itself</span> <span data-start="403.76" data-end="406.07">and themselves like the feeling that you</span> <span data-start="406.07" data-end="408.29">will get from this text it will impact</span> <span data-start="408.29" data-end="410.42">the way you will understand it it will</span> <span data-start="410.42" data-end="413.33">impact a lot the way you will digest</span> <span data-start="413.33" data-end="416.78">this text so reading is mainly of</span> <span data-start="416.78" data-end="419.09">phonological process I love more than</span> <span data-start="419.09" data-end="422.45">three synapse like so phonological</span> <span data-start="422.45" data-end="424.28">basically means that it's the</span> <span data-start="424.28" data-end="426.71">association between a sound and the</span> <span data-start="426.71" data-end="430.4">meaning and that's how reading work so</span> <span data-start="430.4" data-end="432.56">basically like this when you're trying</span> <span data-start="432.56" data-end="434.36">to read there is like two different</span> <span data-start="434.36" data-end="437">voice in your head when trying to read</span> <span data-start="437" data-end="438.98">it and make it a loud one trying to</span> <span data-start="438.98" data-end="440.69">understand it and another one which is</span> <span data-start="440.69" data-end="443.87">the word around Eve trying to interrupt</span> <span data-start="443.87" data-end="447.68">all of that and if you need to create</span> <span data-start="447.68" data-end="449.21">this sound you need to take the words</span> <span data-start="449.21" data-end="451.63">and to make it a sound and for that</span> <span data-start="451.63" data-end="454.94">reading is using our eye but it's not</span> <span data-start="454.94" data-end="457.01">linear at all even if all our texts i</span> <span data-start="457.01" data-end="459.26">bet are based on lines it's not senior</span> <span data-start="459.26" data-end="461.81">at all because we're reading with a ball</span> <span data-start="461.81" data-end="463.76">like our eyes are kind of a ball so you</span> <span data-start="463.76" data-end="465.62">cannot really like move it easily with</span> <span data-start="465.62" data-end="467.66">six muscle on a line so we're doing</span> <span data-start="467.66" data-end="470.12">something called cycads so basically</span> <span data-start="470.12" data-end="471.8">when we are reading we're just jumping a</span> <span data-start="471.8" data-end="474.47">lot from places to places from group of</span> <span data-start="474.47" data-end="476.03">letters to other group of letters and</span> <span data-start="476.03" data-end="478.31">between each of the cycads we have</span> <span data-start="478.31" data-end="481.94">something called fixation so it's the</span> <span data-start="481.94" data-end="483.47">fact that we're stopping on a group of</span> <span data-start="483.47" data-end="485.18">letters before going to another one</span> <span data-start="485.18" data-end="488">and during this fixation it's the moment</span> <span data-start="488" data-end="489.83">where the reading experience is</span> <span data-start="489.83" data-end="492.47">happening so at this moment everything</span> <span data-start="492.47" data-end="494.12">is thought to be blurry around ookubo</span> <span data-start="494.12" data-end="497.45">feathers except the group of letter</span> <span data-start="497.45" data-end="499.55">itself so we are dancing like funerals</span> <span data-start="499.55" data-end="502.13">and all the shapes are round and that's</span> <span data-start="502.13" data-end="504.11">the reading moment and that's how we can</span> <span data-start="504.11" data-end="505.94">calculate the readability of a texts</span> <span data-start="505.94" data-end="508.7">usually i tracking counting the number</span> <span data-start="508.7" data-end="511.85">and length the duration of saccades and</span> <span data-start="511.85" data-end="515.06">the duration of fixation so it's less</span> <span data-start="515.06" data-end="517.339">about words that it is about staring at</span> <span data-start="517.339" data-end="519.26">screens and that's quite nice because</span> <span data-start="519.26" data-end="521.419">that's will that something we'll love to</span> <span data-start="521.419" data-end="524.48">do every day but it's like it's not real</span> <span data-start="524.48" data-end="526.4">about staring at screen it's essentially</span> <span data-start="526.4" data-end="529.19">about identifying shapes shapes of</span> <span data-start="529.19"

data-end="567.569">thanks to you letters identify features</span> <span data-start="567.569" data-end="568.769">letters</span> <span data-start="568.769" data-end="572.23">phones variable phones that's where the</span> <span data-start="572.23" data-end="574.3">link exists between the two things and</span> <span data-start="574.3" data-end="575.92">the I didn't think features it's</span> <span data-start="575.92" data-end="578.139">basically the top part and the lower</span> <span data-start="578.139" data-end="580.66">part of the word that can explain why we</span> <span data-start="580.66" data-end="584.199">can read more easily lowercase word than</span> <span data-start="584.199" data-end="587.5">uppercase and when you have mistakes</span> <span data-start="587.5" data-end="589.54">that's also why you can identify more</span> <span data-start="589.54" data-end="592.089">easily that bubble is problem and not</span> <span data-start="592.089" data-end="596.29">the awful blob of letters that is the</span> <span data-start="596.29" data-end="600.79">last one because it's about sound like</span> <span data-start="600.79" data-end="603.79">it's also like the change of letters</span> <span data-start="603.79" data-end="605.5">needs to happen in the sense that it's</span> <span data-start="605.5" data-end="607.72">part of the same syllabus it's them it's</span> <span data-start="607.72" data-end="610.389">part of the same group of sound and in</span> <span data-start="610.389" data-end="612.1">the two first ones we

<p><span data-start="634.45" data-end="641.649">I love trash pandas it's the nicest</span> <span data-start="641.649" data-end="643.079">thing ever</span> <span data-start="643.079" data-end="646.48">so what's the point of all of that the</span> <span data-start="646.48" data-end="649.93">point is like we need to design for</span> <span data-start="649.93" data-end="652">readability and we need also to</span> <span data-start="652" data-end="654.31">implement for readability and the best</span> <span data-start="654.31" data-end="656.139">way to learn it to look at airports</span> <span data-start="656.139" data-end="658.029">because they have to do that in a really</span> <span data-start="658.029" data-end="660.31">stressful environment which is a moment</span> <span data-start="660.31" data-end="661.959">where people just want to think about</span> <span data-start="661.959" data-end="663.699">the vacation just want to go in the</span> <span data-start="663.699" data-end="665.26">plane and don't want to do any</span> <span data-start="665.26" data-end="667.149">pathfinding and any game in the airports</span> <span data-start="667.149" data-end="669.699">so let's just take a look quickly at</span> <span data-start="669.699" data-end="671.23">what they're doing and the first thing</span> <span data-start="671.23" data-end="673.81">that they are doing its owning only one</span> <span data-start="673.81" data-end="676.99">phone face only one everything is</span> <span data-start="676.99" data-end="678.55">written with the same thing with the</span> <span data-start="678.55" data-end="681.37">same phone things and a series of</span> <span data-start="681.37" data-end="685.54">variations of ways this is really</span> <span data-start="685.54" data-end="688.12">helping for the like content charge and</span> <span data-start="688.12" data-end="690.25">also what they're doing it's not only</span> <span data-start="690.25" data-end="692.769">the way but it's really subtle but</span> <span data-start="692.769" data-end="695.529">they're playing with the tracking</span> <span data-start="695.529" data-end="699.31">between two letters like tteyuu is going</span> <span data-start="699.31" data-end="702.94">together so the two is way closer than B</span> <span data-start="702.94" data-end="706.36">and D for example so still one phone</span> <span data-start="706.36" data-end="710.85">face a series of different font wave and</span> <span data-start="710.85" data-end="713.5">different tracking and you can find this</span> <span data-start="713.5" data-end="716.41">consistency in the background with C Phi</span> <span data-start="716.41" data-end="719.68">which is also really close and way</span> <span data-start="719.68" data-end="721.089">closer that would be a C and E together</span> <span data-start="721.089" data-end="724.899">for example so basically that's what</span> <span data-start="724.899" data-end="727.54">they're doing it's readable it's</span> <span data-start="727.54" data-end="733.42">efficient that's great but can we do</span> <span data-start="733.42" data-end="737.319">better because it's static it's great it</span> <span data-start="737.319" data-end="740.14">works its efficient but it's not working</span> <span data-start="740.14" data-end="740.98">for everybody</span> <span data-start="740.98" data-end="744.25">first you need to speak English that's</span> <span data-start="744.25" data-end="746.079">something you need at least recognize</span> <span data-start="746.079" data-end="750.209">letters and numbers but also it's not</span> <span data-start="750.209" data-end="752.38">adapted to everybody some people don't</span> <span data-start="752.38" data-end="754.329">like the contrast between yellow and</span> <span data-start="754.329" data-end="756.069">black because it's really aggressive</span> <span data-start="756.069" data-end="757.81">it's one of the highest contrast you can</span> <span data-start="757.81" data-end="760.54">find great for readability not so great</span> <span data-start="760.54" data-end="763.39">for autistic people so some autistic</span> <span data-start="763.39" data-end="768.04">people so great but not cast</span> <span data-start="768.04" data-end="774.01">so can we do better ah the sound is not</span> <span data-start="774.01" data-end="775.39">there sorry</span> <span data-start="775.39" data-end="780.52">so yes I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="780.52" data-end="782.74">and yes we did because that's basically</span> <span data-start="782.74" data-end="786.7">what happened with with variable phones</span> <span data-start="786.7" data-end="789.79">it's not only we can do it like there is</span> <span data-start="789.79" data-end="792.7">now a way to do that with only one file</span> <span data-start="792.7" data-end="796.12">so variable font will help you doing</span> <span data-start="796.12" data-end="798.46">will help you do the extra mile and</span> <span data-start="798.46" data-end="801.64">doing like all the effort to go from</span> <span data-start="801.64" data-end="803.5">just offering a readable experience for</span> <span data-start="803.5" data-end="806.5">everybody to offering a way to customize</span> <span data-start="806.5" data-end="809.41">the experience for people and this is</span> <span data-start="809.41" data-end="811.12">important because accessibility is</span> <span data-start="811.12" data-end="815.23">really really really really hard and if</span> <span data-start="815.23" data-end="819.25">it's really hard because it's something</span> <span data-start="819.25" data-end="822.19">that you will never manage to do</span> <span data-start="822.19" data-end="826">entirely you cannot create a fully 100%</span> <span data-start="826" data-end="830.22">accessible solution like you have to do</span> <span data-start="830.22" data-end="833.95">at some moment choices between solutions</span> <span data-start="833.95" data-end="835.36">because not everybody's learned not</span> <span data-start="835.36" data-end="837.37">everything is compatible and because</span> <span data-start="837.37" data-end="838.779">there is no one fits all solution the</span> <span data-start="838.779" data-end="840.82">only way to be accessible if you do</span> <span data-start="840.82" data-end="844.51">customization and the creation of</span> <span data-start="844.51" data-end="846.959">accessible and inclusive experience is</span> <span data-start="846.959" data-end="849.52">something quite interesting because it's</span> <span data-start="849.52" data-end="852.49">about people quite interesting but it's</span> <span data-start="852.49" data-end="854.589">also about collaboration and</span> <span data-start="854.589" data-end="858.42">customization collaboration because</span> <span data-start="858.42" data-end="861.07">first we need to collaborate with our</span> <span data-start="861.07" data-end="863.29">users we need to understand their needs</span> <span data-start="863.29" data-end="865.45">we need to know that what we're doing is</span> <span data-start="865.45" data-end="868.48">meaningful for them but also because it</span> <span data-start="868.48" data-end="871.99">can help creating a lot of collaboration</span> <span data-start="871.99" data-end="875.01">between designers and engineers</span> <span data-start="875.01" data-end="877.33">everybody wants to do accessible on</span> <span data-start="877.33" data-end="878.77">accessible web like I never heard</span> <span data-start="878.77" data-end="880.51">someone saying yeah no I don't want to</span> <span data-start="880.51" data-end="884.29">like I don't care okay I don't care I've</span> <span data-start="884.29" data-end="887.11">heard it but nobody wants to do this on</span> <span data-start="887.11" data-end="889.66">purpose like being like I want to create</span> <span data-start="889.66" data-end="893.74">an inaccessible interface so usually the</span> <span data-start="893.74" data-end="896.26">gap between yeah I'm really interested</span> <span data-start="896.26" data-end="898.45">and I'm making accessible websites it's</span> <span data-start="898.45" data-end="900.64">not so much about skills because you can</span> <span data-start="900.64" data-end="901.1">learn</span> <span data-start="901.1" data-end="903.71">on internet it's more about discussions</span> <span data-start="903.71" data-end="906.59">on collaboration you need first to share</span> <span data-start="906.59" data-end="908.3">the same language between designers and</span> <span data-start="908.3" data-end="911.78">engineers because language is a really</span> <span data-start="911.78" data-end="914.3">root element to reality the best way to</span> <span data-start="914.3" data-end="916.01">share common reality between people is</span> <span data-start="916.01" data-end="918.98">to share some language and designers and</span> <span data-start="918.98" data-end="920.42">engineers don't really know anymore how</span> <span data-start="920.42" data-end="922.85">to discuss together but variable phones</span> <span data-start="922.85" data-end="926.96">can be a solution for that and also it's</span> <span data-start="926.96" data-end="929.03">a good way to customize experiences for</span> <span data-start="929.03" data-end="932.21">our users and to offer them the way to</span> <span data-start="932.21" data-end="935.42">do what they need to do to be</span> <span data-start="935.42" data-end="937.24">comfortable

different</span> <span data-start="945.11" data-end="947.21">capabilities some people can read like a</span> <span data-start="947.21" data-end="948.65">whole book during the whole day without</span>
