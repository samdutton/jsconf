<span data-start="361.479" data-end="363.34">there's a raging debate and I have it</span> <span data-start="363.34" data-end="365.07">with some of my developers on my teams</span> <span

data-end="385.12">generally the jazz performance is a</span> <span data-start="385.12" data-end="388.18">little slower but my argument is that</span> <span data-start="388.18" data-end="389.44">unless

<p><span data-start="405.73" data-end="406.96">I'll talk about why that might not be</span> <span data-start="406.96" data-end="409.36">the case either and the other argument</span> <span data-start="409.36" data-end="412.54">for things like the for each method on</span> <span data-start="412.54" data-end="414.64">lodash or underscore is that it can</span> <span data-start="414.64" data-end="417.46">handle both arrays and objects it's kind</span> <span data-start="417.46" data-end="418.84">of neat you have to worry about it itals</span> <span data-start="418.84" data-end="420.67">no checking to write it'll just ignore</span> <span data-start="420.67" data-end="423.73">it if it's no but I argue that with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="423.73" data-end="426.3">JavaScript being a weakly typed and</span> <span data-start="426.3" data-end="428.83">dynamically typed language there's a lot</span> <span
