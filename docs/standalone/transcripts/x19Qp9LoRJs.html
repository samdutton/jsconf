data-end="262.74">optimal target size you should use and</span> <span data-start="262.74" data-end="264.27">so we ran a bunch of experiments</span> <span data-start="264.27" data-end="267.47">changing the size of the touch target</span> <span data-start="267.47" data-end="269.91">over a range of different values and</span> <span data-start="269.91" data-end="272.28">what we found is that as you
