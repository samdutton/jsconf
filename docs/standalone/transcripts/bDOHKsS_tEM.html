<p><span data-start="291.4" data-end="293.11">Redis as a as a queue and I suppose a</span> <span data-start="293.11" data-end="296.35">shared like cash among all of our note</span> <span data-start="296.35" data-end="299.83">instances so out of all like this this</span> <span data-start="299.83" data-end="302.2">this slide here we probably have 60 of</span> <span data-start="302.2" data-end="303.85">these instances that are all processing</span> <span data-start="303.85" data-end="306.37">data from like five Jenkins masters that</span> <span data-start="306.37" data-end="308.71">are all feeding data into it and that's</span> <span data-start="308.71" data-end="310.03">happening throughout Jenkins plugin so</span> <span data-start="310.03" data-end="311.08">we have a plug-in that's all it's doing</span> <span data-start="311.08" data-end="312.729">is pushing information to read us and</span> <span data-start="312.729" data-end="316.6">then what what we get out of on the node</span> <span data-start="316.6" data-end="318.669">side is just handling that throwing it</span> <span data-start="318.669" data-end="322.18">into a database and then having everyone</span> <span data-start="322.18" data-end="324.46">hit it to get their reason why their</span> <span data-start="324.46" data-end="326.38">bill failed and where their commit is so</span> <span data-start="326.38" data-end="327.91">it kind of takes you know what's coming</span> <span data-start="327.91" data-end="330.07">off of this you know build and inverting</span> <span data-start="330.07" data-end="331.84">it so that you can query everything by</span> <span data-start="331.84" data-end="336.31">your code chicken so an example of what</span> <span data-start="336.31" data-end="338.95">you know folks you know would do if we</span> <span data-start="338.95" data-end="340.33">didn't have happy and what we see a lot</span> <span data-start="340.33" data-end="343.45">and in other other places that we have</span> <span data-start="343.45" data-end="345.31">some value and then you're doing this</span> <span data-start="345.31" data-end="347.44">all the time and it's never this simple</span> <span data-start="347.44" data-end="349.21">but you this winds up being horrible for</span> <span data-start="349.21" data-end="351.7">a lot of reasons when we have joy as an</span> <span data-start="351.7" data-end="353.47">alternative so instead with joy we get</span> <span data-start="353.47" data-end="355.69">to do this and hopefully this isn't new</span> <span data-start="355.69" data-end="357.61">to anyone but what's great about this is</span> <span data-start="357.61" data-end="359.83">that this when you have this everywhere</span> <span data-start="359.83" data-end="361.87">you could just take the object inside of</span> <span data-start="361.87" data-end="363.37">here and then just put it in a shared</span> <span data-start="363.37" data-end="365.44">place and then wind up if you ever need</span> <span data-start="365.44" data-end="367.419">expect the same result you can instead</span> <span data-start="367.419" data-end="369.82">of copying pasting or having a function</span> <span data-start="369.82" data-end="372.34">you wind up having a an object that's</span> <span data-start="372.34" data-end="374.889">very descriptive and so when you when</span> <span data-start="374.889" data-end="376.21">you have changes to this is great so</span> <span data-start="376.21" data-end="378.51">instead of writing changes like say if</span> <span data-start="378.51" data-end="381.639">foo will become something else because</span> <span data-start="381.639" data-end="386.05">we're say we have Baz now right as a</span> <span data-start="386.05" data-end="388.81">thing that's we renamed something one</span> <span data-start="388.81" data-end="390.55">example that's more real that doesn't</span> <span data-start="390.55" data-end="392.2">fit on the slide though is we changed</span> <span data-start="392.2" data-end="394.719">something for commit sha to commit sha-1</span> <span data-start="394.719" data-end="396.34">because some things were using commit</span> <span data-start="396.34" data-end="398.08">sha some older versions and some were</span> <span data-start="398.08" data-end="400.03">using commit underscore shot one</span> <span data-start="400.03" data-end="402.75">so I wanted to support both and so</span> <span data-start="402.75" data-end="406.33">something that we wind up like a</span> <span data-start="406.33" data-end="408.79">prevalent idea at Yahoo that that's</span> <span data-start="408.79" data-end="410.95">changing really quickly is the fact that</span> <span data-start="410.95" data-end="414.22">you can't is like you think of you know</span> <span data-start="414.22" data-end="415.48">when we have breaking changes we're just</span> <span data-start="415.48" data-end="416.89">going to deploy all these things and I</span> <span data-start="416.89" data-end="419.65">want to go we're going to take down the</span> <span data-start="419.65" data-end="421.51">old system and restore with the new</span> <span data-start="421.51" data-end="424.78">system and do that by rotating you know</span> <span data-start="424.78" data-end="426.97">these giant subsystems out of out of a</span> <span data-start="426.97" data-end="428.38">rotation and it's had the old system</span> <span data-start="428.38" data-end="429.7">running for a while and kill them off</span> <span data-start="429.7" data-end="431.26">and then we have the new system which is</span> <span data-start="431.26" data-end="433.69">all deployed together by Khan and that</span> <span data-start="433.69" data-end="435.91">doesn't work like we don't want to do</span> <span data-start="435.91" data-end="437.65">this instead everything needs to be more</span> <span data-start="437.65" data-end="439.54">loosely coupled instead of very tightly</span> <span data-start="439.54" data-end="440.98">coupled together so we want to support</span> <span data-start="440.98" data-end="443.32">different things different sometimes</span> <span data-start="443.32" data-end="445.9">different schemas at the same time so if</span> <span data-start="445.9" data-end="448.39">this is the case we wind up being able</span> <span data-start="448.39" data-end="450.07">to use joy to do again this very simple</span> <span data-start="450.07" data-end="451.6">example but why is it being very</span> <span data-start="451.6" data-end="454.24">powerful in a large system where you</span> <span data-start="454.24" data-end="455.83">could just support both and still have</span> <span data-start="455.83" data-end="459.04">like our new configuration and and we</span> <span data-start="459.04" data-end="460.15">just wind up changing a lot of these</span> <span data-start="460.15" data-end="461.98">together as necessary and then killing</span> <span data-start="461.98" data-end="463.81">this off again by having continuous</span> <span data-start="463.81" data-end="464.92">deployment we don't have to have this</span> <span data-start="464.92" data-end="466.24">rename in there forever we could just</span> <span data-start="466.24" data-end="467.41">get rid of it after a short period of</span> <span data-start="467.41" data-end="471.82">time

data-start="545.98" data-end="547.629">and over again I would encourage you to</span> <span data-start="547.629" data-end="550.3">be using joy where instead you were only</span> <span

data-end="566.439">to get a high level of coverage and then</span> <span data-start="566.439" data-end="568.36">also like this is an example just lifted</span> <span data-start="568.36" data-end="569.98">straight out of if you guys aren't</span> <span data-start="569.98" data-end="571.99">familiar with with joy this has just</span> <span data-start="571.99" data-end="574.99">lifted

expressive and</span> <span data-start="579.399" data-end="582.67">it's I find that once you start using it</span> <span data-start="582.67" data-end="584.11">it becomes very easy to read and not</span> <span data-start="584.11" data-end="585.97">just for me but also for machines and so</span> <span data-start="585.97" data-end="588.73">we've seen people talking about loud</span> <span data-start="588.73" data-end="590.259">today if you guys haven't used loud it</span> <span data-start="590.259" data-end="593.649">can read this information in your happy</span> <span data-start="593.649" data-end="596.74">route configs and show you formatted</span> <span data-start="596.74" data-end="598.779">documentation we also seen swagger today</span> <span data-start="598.779" data-end="601.529">which also reads this which is great and</span> <span data-start="601.529" data-end="604.3">so yeah it's it provides benefits for</span> <span data-start="604.3" data-end="608.47">people and for creating your api's so in</span> <span data-start="608.47" data-end="610.839">happy particularly um you know so you</span> <span data-start="610.839" data-end="613.269">use this you use joy for your request</span> <span data-start="613.269" data-end="615.31">schemas I'd also encourage you I haven't</span> <span data-start="615.31" data-end="616.93">seen a lot of examples of this and your</span> <span data-start="616.93" data-end="618.37">response schemas and so what this is</span> <span data-start="618.37" data-end="620.769">allowed us to do is prevent sharing too</span> <span data-start="620.769" data-end="623.23">much we might get more information as we</span> <span data-start="623.23" data-end="624.88">proxy something from another system or</span> <span data-start="624.88" data-end="626.17">we're getting information out of a</span> <span data-start="626.17" data-end="627.91">database we might be getting more than</span> <span data-start="627.91" data-end="630.73">we expect and so with by using a</span> <span data-start="630.73" data-end="632.829">response schema with strip puck known we</span> <span data-start="632.829" data-end="634.42">can remove things that we don't expect</span> <span data-start="634.42" data-end="637.839">or don't want to share with our people</span> <span data-start="637.839" data-end="641.23">who consume our API and we can also you</span> <span data-start="641.23" data-end="643.509">know kind of massage values into the</span> <span data-start="643.509" data-end="645.639">right place by using rename so if there</span> <span data-start="645.639" data-end="647.259">is something that's legacy coming from</span> <span data-start="647.259" data-end="649.24">an upstream system we can just take that</span> <span data-start="649.24" data-end="650.86">into the correct format and hand that</span> <span data-start="650.86" data-end="652.87">off we also use something like the last</span> <span data-start="652.87" data-end="654.67">talked actually just have different API</span> <span data-start="654.67" data-end="657.519">versions which is also useful so this we</span> <span data-start="657.519" data-end="658.72">could serve something old to the old</span> <span data-start="658.72" data-end="660.309">version and then rename it for the new</span> <span data-start="660.309" data-end="665.009">version using response schemas others so</span> <span data-start="665.009" data-end="667.15">let's see also</span> <span data-start="667.15" data-end="669.13">loud is great I want to put it in big</span> <span data-start="669.13" data-end="673.54">text here so you don't miss it and I</span> <span data-start="673.54" data-end="675.7">really hope that this gets even better</span> <span data-start="675.7" data-end="678.31">i'm looking forward to like i've tried</span> <span data-start="678.31" data-end="679.51">to use swagger before and it just seems</span> <span data-start="679.51" data-end="681.73">like it's a it's a lot and loud isn't a</span> <span data-start="681.73" data-end="683.41">whole bunch it's just it's very small it</span> <span data-start="683.41" data-end="685.87">doesn't depend on other like front-end</span> <span data-start="685.87" data-end="687.79">framework things that allow you to give</span> <span data-start="687.79" data-end="689.83">you the nice try it out button so I'm</span> <span data-start="689.83" data-end="691.93">hoping that I know like swagger has a</span> <span data-start="691.93" data-end="693.73">lot of work that's happening with it</span> <span data-start="693.73" data-end="695.5">last time I checked like few months ago</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="695.5" data-end="698.5">I'm just like this is great i'm like</span> <span data-start="698.5" data-end="701.05">really trying to sell my team on and and</span> <span data-start="701.05" data-end="703.72">with great success on how great having a</span> <span data-start="703.72" data-end="706.3">consistent API is where you don't have</span> <span data-start="706.3" data-end="708.82">to have api comments to go out of date</span> <span data-start="708.82" data-end="710.43">instead you can use loud and it's very</span> <span data-start="710.43" data-end="712.9">things stay up to date so for the things</span> <span data-start="712.9" data-end="715.06">that I want to use not the future of</span> <span data-start="715.06" data-end="717.52">half of joy but the things that I want</span> <span data-start="717.52" data-end="719.71">to do with it is having schemas that are</span> <span data-start="719.71" data-end="723.45">shared and so the big thing here is</span> <span data-start="723.45" data-end="725.86">right now sometimes we have duplication</span> <span data-start="725.86" data-end="728.2">and our schemas sometimes like you know</span> <span data-start="728.2" data-end="730.3">one of our plugins and one in our API</span> <span data-start="730.3" data-end="733.2">don't share the same schema all the time</span> <span data-start="733.2" data-end="735.64">there's nothing in common between there</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="735.64" data-end="737.38">I suppose that like a like we don't have</span> <span data-start="737.38" data-end="740.77">a schema node module and so I really</span> <span data-start="740.77" data-end="741.82">like therefore there would be a way to</span> <span data-start="741.82" data-end="743.23">share that because we've gotten new bugs</span> <span data-start="743.23" data-end="746.08">where schemas deviate and so one system</span> <span data-start="746.08" data-end="748.48">won't accept the others output and vice</span> <span data-start="748.48" data-end="751.21">versa and that's a really big pain and</span> <span data-start="751.21" data-end="753.31">so it's possible and this is a lot</span> <span data-start="753.31" data-end="754.96">better it's a lot easier to find bugs</span> <span data-start="754.96" data-end="756.55">now that everything's in an object</span> <span data-start="756.55" data-end="758.23">instead of everything being in a whole</span> <span data-start="758.23" data-end="761.2">bunch of conditionals so so this is the</span> <span data-start="761.2" data-end="765.48">logical next step and also all of our</span> <span data-start="765.48" data-end="768.07">how everyone I don't have enough time to</span> <span data-start="768.07" data-end="769.93">get into like how awesome this is</span> <span data-start="769.93" data-end="771.58">basically but if you everyone views</span> </p>
