data-start="133.16" data-end="134.72">all that work for people so that they</span> <span data-start="134.72" data-end="137.42">can just focus on the gameplay focus on</span> <span data-start="137.42" data-end="139.58">the experience and what's really nice</span> <span data-start="139.58" data-end="141.29">about that is that because we take all</span> <span data-start="141.29" data-end="142.64">those little technical aspects that you</span> <span data-start="142.64" data-end="144.08">usually need lots years and years of</span> <span data-start="144.08" data-end="146.75">experience doing we've just cut all that</span> <span data-start="146.75" data-end="148.61">out and it leaves a really nice simple</span> <span data-start="148.61" data-end="150.47">shell that people can work with and it</span> <span data-start="150.47" data-end="152.48">really aligns nicely with kids because</span> <span data-start="152.48" data-end="154.01">they don't have to do all these fancy</span> <span data-start="154.01" data-end="155.6">things they can just hit the ground</span> <span data-start="155.6" data-end="158.51">running within like five minutes if you</span> <span data-start="158.51" data-end="159.71">want to see this in action we actually</span> <span data-start="159.71" data-end="160.88">have a workshop tomorrow where we're</span> <span data-start="160.88" data-end="162.05">going to literally do that with kids</span> <span data-start="162.05" data-end="163.79">they'll just have games up and running</span> <span data-start="163.79" data-end="167.63">really quick and technically full</span> <span data-start="167.63" data-end="169.82">disclosure we aren't actually JavaScript</span> <span data-start="169.82" data-end="171.47">so I appreciate you all welcomed me</span> <span data-start="171.47" data-end="175.1">welcoming me to your tier community we</span> <span data-start="175.1"

quirks anyway</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="181.97" data-end="182.99">I didn't really want to talk too much</span> <span data-start="182.99" data-end="184.49">about robots specifically I did want to</span> <span data-start="184.49" data-end="187.37">talk about our developers because</span> <span data-start="187.37" data-end="190.25">they're a pretty unique Bunch they're</span> <span data-start="190.25" data-end="192.2">like a lot of people you probably know</span> <span data-start="192.2" data-end="193.91">they're very passionate very talented</span> <span data-start="193.91" data-end="196.66">very driven but they're also very young</span> <span data-start="196.66" data-end="198.89">because we're a platform that's</span> <span data-start="198.89" data-end="200.72">primarily aimed at kids are the games on</span> <span data-start="200.72" data-end="203.24">our platforms are played by kids you</span> <span data-start="203.24" data-end="206.51">know 9 10 11 and they suddenly get this</span> <span data-start="206.51" data-end="209.87">kind of realization moment usually when</span> <span data-start="209.87" data-end="210.92">they're kind of like in middle school</span> <span data-start="210.92" data-end="211.76">there get a little more tech-savvy</span> <span data-start="211.76" data-end="213.56">they're playing all these games on the</span> <span data-start="213.56" data-end="216.59">platform they realize oh these games</span> <span data-start="216.59" data-end="219.23">were also made by kids maybe I could do</span> <span data-start="219.23" data-end="222.65">that too and so they often start off</span> <span data-start="222.65" data-end="224.33">being like okay well let's just dive</span> <span data-start="224.33" data-end="225.739">into this and again we try to make it</span> <span data-start="225.739" data-end="227.03">very simple for people to get started</span> <span data-start="227.03" data-end="228.59">you don't have to learn you don't have</span> <span data-start="228.59" data-end="230.81">to learn about you know a big fancy game</span> <span data-start="230.81" data-end="232.37">engine you can just get a project going</span> <span data-start="232.37" data-end="234.29">on day one and so they'll just</span> <span data-start="234.29" data-end="236.36">experiment they'll just try things a lot</span> <span data-start="236.36" data-end="238.01">of these kids are self-motivated</span> <span data-start="238.01" data-end="240.41">self-learn they try to just recreate</span> <span data-start="240.41" data-end="242.15">games that they see or just recreate</span> <span data-start="242.15" data-end="243.95">little mechanics or they'll</span> <span data-start="243.95" data-end="246.86">reverse-engineer you know it's something</span> <span data-start="246.86" data-end="249.14">that they've seen and so they're a very</span> <span data-start="249.14" data-end="250.94">interesting bunch and I really like</span> <span data-start="250.94" data-end="253.34">working with them for lots of reasons</span> <span data-start="253.34" data-end="255.23">and

data-end="466.289">but the other really big part of these</span> <span data-start="466.289" data-end="469.02">programs and whoa Kisan here is that we</span> <span data-start="469.02" data-end="470.569">give them mentorship and guidance</span> <span data-start="470.569" data-end="472.74">because really the theme of what i want</span> <span data-start="472.74" data-end="473.969">to talk about today is that there's lots</span> <span data-start="473.969" data-end="475.65">of these young developers out there who</span> <span data-start="475.65" data-end="478.68">are really gifted and talented but</span> <span data-start="478.68" data-end="480.389">they're lacking in some just kind of</span> <span data-start="480.389" data-end="483.12">real world expertise a lot of them again</span> <span data-start="483.12" data-end="485.31">our self-taught self-motivated you know</span> <span data-start="485.31" data-end="487.529">they you know watch videos on YouTube</span> <span data-start="487.529" data-end="489.24">they read tutorials they just kind of</span> <span data-start="489.24" data-end="491.639">try things out a lot of times they'll</span> <span data-start="491.639" data-end="493.02">come to us as sort of lone wolves</span> <span data-start="493.02" data-end="494.969">they're like yeah I've dabbled with</span> <span data-start="494.969" data-end="496.74">everything I've learned a lot but then</span> <span data-start="496.74" data-end="498.75">they don't really know how to take that</span> <span data-start="498.75" data-end="499.949">to the next level they don't know how to</span> <span data-start="499.949" data-end="502.08">achieve like their vision of creating a</span> <span data-start="502.08" data-end="504.18">game or making an app in our case is</span> <span data-start="504.18" data-end="506.599">pretty much exclusively games but again</span> <span data-start="506.599" data-end="509.569">it this applies to pretty much anything</span> <span data-start="509.569" data-end="512.55">and so yeah when they come to us we</span> <span data-start="512.55" data-end="514.74">really just kind of kickstart them</span> <span data-start="514.74" data-end="517.199">through development of their games you</span> <span data-start="517.199" data-end="518.699">know we sit them down they make sure</span> <span data-start="518.699" data-end="520.44">that they have a plan make sure that</span> <span data-start="520.44" data-end="522.36">they assemble teams make sure that</span> <span data-start="522.36" data-end="523.8">they're prototyping again just all these</span> <span data-start="523.8" data-end="526.589">things that maybe not may not be super</span> <span data-start="526.589" data-end="528.06">obvious to a developer</span> <span data-start="528.06" data-end="529.74">who's just starting out but something</span> <span data-start="529.74" data-end="531.93">that we as industry experts can kind of</span> <span data-start="531.93" data-end="534.75">impart upon them and it's kind of kind</span> <span data-start="534.75" data-end="535.95">of shows you some of the things that</span> <span data-start="535.95" data-end="536.82">came out of this</span> <span data-start="536.82" data-end="538.47">there's just three titles that happen in</span> <span data-start="538.47" data-end="541.62">we are a platform and just to give you</span> <span data-start="541.62" data-end="543.6">some context across these three titles</span> <span data-start="543.6" data-end="545.61">there's more than two billion game plays</span> <span data-start="545.61" data-end="549.12">across all three of them it's just again</span> <span data-start="549.12" data-end="551.4">just blows my mind the success of some</span> <span data-start="551.4" data-end="553.29">of these young devs have these are all</span> <span data-start="553.29" data-end="555.68">people like half my age and it's just</span> <span data-start="555.68" data-end="559.35">it's I don't know I just get flex I</span> <span data-start="559.35" data-end="560.49">can't talk about them because they're</span> <span data-start="560.49" data-end="564.87">just so amazing so yeah again so we work</span> <span data-start="564.87" data-end="567.66">with these kids on site and so now I'll</span> <span data-start="567.66" data-end="568.74">just talk about you know some of the</span> <span data-start="568.74" data-end="570.18">learnings that we have and like how we</span> <span data-start="570.18" data-end="572.1">how we work with them and how we guide</span> <span data-start="572.1" data-end="574.5">them in how we mentor them and again</span> <span data-start="574.5" data-end="576.39">giving the context that they're all</span> <span data-start="576.39" data-end="579.87">really really young so kind of one of</span> <span data-start="579.87" data-end="581.49">the first lessons we learned very early</span> <span data-start="581.49" data-end="585.42">on was not trying to tell them what to</span> <span data-start="585.42" data-end="587.76">do in terms of like make this game</span> <span data-start="587.76" data-end="589.74">implement this thing do it this way use</span> <span data-start="589.74" data-end="592.83">this tech we definitely tried that early</span> <span data-start="592.83" data-end="594.66">on we were like hey you know let's let's</span> <span data-start="594.66" data-end="596.1">try to have you make this game we had a</span> <span data-start="596.1" data-end="598.5">very heavy-handed approach in all</span> <span data-start="598.5" data-end="600.72">aspects of their development from the</span> <span data-start="600.72" data-end="604.98">design to the implementation and you</span> <span data-start="604.98" data-end="607.47">know we we we met a lot of resistance I</span> <span data-start="607.47" data-end="609.42">think that if you if they even work with</span> <span data-start="609.42" data-end="611.43">kids or work with almost anyone really</span> <span data-start="611.43" data-end="613.05">no one really likes to be forced to do</span> <span data-start="613.05" data-end="615.27">what to do we don't want to be told what</span> <span data-start="615.27" data-end="617.22">to do they don't to be forced rather</span> <span data-start="617.22" data-end="620.43">they you want to be guiding people and</span> <span data-start="620.43" data-end="622.17">so that's kind of what we shifted</span> <span data-start="622.17" data-end="624.35">towards was instead of telling them hey</span> <span data-start="624.35" data-end="626.82">here's the games that you should make we</span> <span data-start="626.82" data-end="628.62">instead try to just inspire and guide</span> <span data-start="628.62" data-end="631.5">them one of the classic stories I like</span> <span data-start="631.5" data-end="634.02">to actually tell about this in terms of</span> <span data-start="634.02" data-end="635.67">not forcing is that one of our early</span> <span data-start="635.67" data-end="639.36">early folks in fact the person who made</span> <span data-start="639.36" data-end="641.209">that game on the far left in each city</span> <span data-start="641.209" data-end="644.67">he came in he pitched a game to us he's</span> <span data-start="644.67" data-end="645.779">like oh we're gonna make this game</span> <span data-start="645.779" data-end="647.67">you're gonna just socialize or hang out</span> <span data-start="647.67" data-end="648.93">with your friends there might be some</span> <span data-start="648.93" data-end="650.25">mini games it might make a house but</span> <span data-start="650.25" data-end="651.209">really it's just kind of this social</span> <span data-start="651.209" data-end="654.12">hangout thing and a whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="654.12" data-end="657.27">veteran gaming people looked at him or</span> <span data-start="657.27" data-end="658.92">just like that</span> <span data-start="658.92" data-end="661.62">never going to work do something else</span> <span data-start="661.62" data-end="662.22">make this other</span> <span data-start="662.22" data-end="666.12">game he did it it was okay and then he</span> <span data-start="666.12" data-end="668.46">came back and made me city and again</span> <span data-start="668.46" data-end="670.26">this is the game that we said hey don't</span> <span data-start="670.26" data-end="671.97">you know this game probably is not gonna</span> <span data-start="671.97" data-end="674.49">work but then it did it's super super</span> <span data-start="674.49" data-end="675.99">popular as one of our top games of the</span> <span data-start="675.99" data-end="677.52">platform and it has been for like over a</span> <span data-start="677.52" data-end="680.19">year so again kind of lesson we got from</span> <span data-start="680.19" data-end="683.85">that was you know the people that were</span> <span data-start="683.85" data-end="685.26">working with these young developers they</span> <span data-start="685.26" data-end="686.91">have a dream they have a vision and they</span> <span data-start="686.91" data-end="689.13">also really understand these new</span> <span data-start="689.13" data-end="692.34">audiences as well and so really what</span> <span data-start="692.34" data-end="694.77">we're looking to do with them is again</span> <span data-start="694.77" data-end="696.42">not tell them what to do but just help</span> <span data-start="696.42" data-end="700.62">them reach their goals so in terms of</span> <span data-start="700.62" data-end="703.2">inspiring you know really what we do is</span> <span data-start="703.2" data-end="704.97">we try to help them refine their ideas</span> <span data-start="704.97" data-end="707.1">so kind of the example I like to use for</span> <span data-start="707.1" data-end="708.93">that is one of the very first things</span> <span data-start="708.93" data-end="711.51">we'll do with kids when they come join</span> <span data-start="711.51" data-end="713.46">these programs we talk about their game</span> <span data-start="713.46" data-end="715.59">pitches I don't know if you're familiar</span> <span data-start="715.59" data-end="717.24">with this but quite often you'll hear</span> <span data-start="717.24" data-end="718.71">there's a term called an elevator pitch</span> <span data-start="718.71" data-end="721.26">where you have to try to exploit boil</span> <span data-start="721.26" data-end="722.91">your game down so that if you're talking</span> <span data-start="722.91" data-end="724.2">with someone in like two minutes you</span> <span data-start="724.2" data-end="726.21">could convey what it is and they could</span> <span data-start="726.21" data-end="728.46">kind of buy into that and we took that a</span> <span data-start="728.46" data-end="729.83">step further than we're saying okay</span> <span data-start="729.83" data-end="732">typically I usually hear like say it's</span> <span data-start="732" data-end="734.1">like do this in two minutes we tell them</span> <span data-start="734.1" data-end="736.77">okay you've got 15 seconds to sell me on</span> <span data-start="736.77" data-end="739.77">your game and you know it's a tough</span> <span data-start="739.77" data-end="741.24">challenge they don't they can't do that</span> <span data-start="741.24" data-end="743.25">right away they have to work on really</span> <span data-start="743.25" data-end="745.47">boiling down and distilling their game's</span> <span data-start="745.47" data-end="747.78">mechanics to the real core of what</span> <span data-start="747.78" data-end="749.94">they're trying to do it's a big</span> <span data-start="749.94" data-end="752.43">challenge but it really helps them think</span> <span data-start="752.43" data-end="753.93">critically about what they're trying to</span> <span data-start="753.93" data-end="755.94">do because well quite often if you just</span> <span data-start="755.94" data-end="757.47">sort of let these young developers loose</span> <span data-start="757.47" data-end="759">they have a million ideas that go in a</span> <span data-start="759" data-end="760.56">million different directions and they</span> <span data-start="760.56" data-end="763.14">just spaghetti all over the place and by</span> <span data-start="763.14" data-end="765.3">kind of just saying hey take a step back</span> <span data-start="765.3" data-end="767.19">just think correctly about what you're</span> <span data-start="767.19" data-end="770.07">doing it really helps them focus it and</span> <span data-start="770.07" data-end="772.11">get started on the right foot and we</span> <span data-start="772.11" data-end="774.57">kind of carry all carry that through the</span> <span data-start="774.57" data-end="777.57">whole process so that goes to you know</span> <span data-start="777.57" data-end="779.16">thinking about their game mechanics you</span> <span data-start="779.16" data-end="780.96">know don't try to do a billion things</span> <span data-start="780.96" data-end="782.91">try to really hone in a couple really</span> <span data-start="782.91" data-end="784.92">core nice things you can execute well on</span> <span data-start="784.92" data-end="788.76">and it applies to all areas of their</span> <span data-start="788.76" data-end="790.8">design to you know their interface their</span> <span data-start="790.8" data-end="793.65">environment design just their just their</span> <span data-start="793.65" data-end="794.83">game mechanics</span> <span data-start="794.83" data-end="796.36">because really once they do that then</span> <span data-start="796.36" data-end="797.74">they can arrive at a really nice clean</span> <span data-start="797.74" data-end="802.899">idea and execute on it and then another</span> <span data-start="802.899" data-end="804.61">thing that we try to help them do again</span> <span data-start="804.61" data-end="806.649">as I said a lot of these kids will come</span> <span data-start="806.649" data-end="809.74">to us just again having done this all on</span> <span data-start="809.74" data-end="812.41">their own they you know just you know</span> <span data-start="812.41" data-end="814.089">we're in their bedroom and they just</span> <span data-start="814.089" data-end="816.43">were hacking away and that's great they</span> <span data-start="816.43" data-end="818.62">learned a lot but I think as you all</span> <span data-start="818.62" data-end="821.05">know any project of any kind of</span> <span data-start="821.05" data-end="823.329">significant size even even smaller</span> <span data-start="823.329" data-end="825.31">projects you really need to have a team</span> <span data-start="825.31" data-end="826.39">you can't do it alone</span> <span data-start="826.39" data-end="828.519">and that's a thing that a lot of these</span> <span data-start="828.519" data-end="830.17">young developers don't always</span> <span data-start="830.17" data-end="831.82">necessarily understand you know</span> <span data-start="831.82" data-end="833.38">sometimes they'll be working with their</span> <span data-start="833.38" data-end="835.39">friends and whatnot but by and large the</span> <span data-start="835.39" data-end="837.25">pattern that I've seen is that they're</span> <span data-start="837.25" data-end="838.72">they're trying they think that they can</span> <span data-start="838.72" data-end="841.089">do it all and they try to do it all and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="841.089" data-end="843.91">I definitely encourage people to touch</span> <span data-start="843.91" data-end="845.95">all different areas of development I</span> <span data-start="845.95" data-end="847.18">mean that's what I did on my journey I</span> <span data-start="847.18" data-end="849.01">was a full-stack engineer and learned</span> <span data-start="849.01" data-end="850.329">very quickly about the areas of</span> <span data-start="850.329" data-end="851.92">development that I didn't like so I</span> <span data-start="851.92" data-end="854.95">definitely like people exploring but I</span> <span data-start="854.95" data-end="856.779">do want people to kind of understand you</span> <span data-start="856.779" data-end="858.04">know what are the areas that I'm really</span> <span data-start="858.04" data-end="859.72">passionate about because when you have</span> <span data-start="859.72" data-end="861.13">that sort of intrinsic motivation when</span> <span data-start="861.13" data-end="863.02">you love what you're doing it makes it</span> <span data-start="863.02" data-end="864.959">that much more easy to be successful and</span> <span data-start="864.959" data-end="868.089">you know you make your projects work and</span> <span data-start="868.089" data-end="869.44">so the things that we'll do with these</span> <span data-start="869.44" data-end="871.149">teams is we'll help them understand ok</span> <span data-start="871.149" data-end="872.35">you know what are the things that you're</span> <span data-start="872.35" data-end="874.12">good at where are the things that you</span> <span data-start="874.12" data-end="875.92">enjoy doing and the things that you</span> <span data-start="875.92" data-end="877.209">either you know don't enjoy doing or</span> <span data-start="877.209" data-end="878.92">don't think you have the time for you</span> <span data-start="878.92" data-end="880.24">know let's help you figure out how to</span> <span data-start="880.24" data-end="883.029">form a team around that how can you you</span> <span data-start="883.029" data-end="884.41">know hire artists how can you</span> <span data-start="884.41" data-end="886.72">collaborate with other coders you know a</span> <span data-start="886.72" data-end="887.98">lot of these kids haven't worked with</span> <span data-start="887.98" data-end="889.899">any kind of you know source control or</span> <span data-start="889.899" data-end="890.98">version or anything like that</span> <span data-start="890.98" data-end="893.26">so collaboration is a really big</span> <span data-start="893.26" data-end="895.209">learning for a lot of these young devs</span> <span data-start="895.209" data-end="897.88">and then you know just even things in</span> <span data-start="897.88" data-end="899.86">terms of leadership and just the soft</span> <span data-start="899.86" data-end="901.449">skills involved with working with other</span> <span data-start="901.449" data-end="903.79">people it's not all just tech you know</span> <span data-start="903.79" data-end="905.17">you have to get along with the people</span> <span data-start="905.17" data-end="906.73">you're working with or if you don't get</span> <span data-start="906.73" data-end="907.959">along you have to figure out how to not</span> <span data-start="907.959" data-end="911.38">work with them and you know I I'm glad</span> <span data-start="911.38" data-end="912.55">that I don't have to do this but some of</span> <span data-start="912.55" data-end="914.11">the other people who work with these</span> <span data-start="914.11" data-end="916.12">kids who are a little bit more closely</span> <span data-start="916.12" data-end="917.68">involved the program you know they're</span> <span data-start="917.68"
