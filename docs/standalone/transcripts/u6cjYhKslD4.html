<p><span data-start="255.96" data-end="260.31">Jeff so I said let's just let's just</span> <span data-start="260.31" data-end="263.46">absorb this for a second how awesome it</span> <span data-start="263.46" data-end="267.54">repeats forever too I love it okay okay</span> <span data-start="267.54" data-end="271.65">so the first technique is to hoist out</span> <span data-start="271.65" data-end="276">dot call and apply from your iteration</span> <span data-start="276" data-end="278.49">functions and I put a little key down</span> <span data-start="278.49" data-end="280.83">here at the bottom that shows the</span> <span data-start="280.83" data-end="282.54">libraries that this applies to so if you</span> <span data-start="282.54" data-end="283.979">use any of these libraries this</span> <span data-start="283.979" data-end="285.45">technique applies to that and you can</span> <span data-start="285.45" data-end="285.66">create</span> <span data-start="285.66" data-end="287.43">patch for it or an issue for that</span> <span data-start="287.43" data-end="291.18">library so that's backbone dojo ember</span> <span data-start="291.18" data-end="295.29">jquery prime which is mu tools to and</span> <span data-start="295.29" data-end="296.76">then underscore and i'm sure there's</span> <span data-start="296.76" data-end="298.68">more every every library has some kind</span> <span data-start="298.68" data-end="300.72">of iteration utility every library has</span> <span data-start="300.72" data-end="302.88">some kind of event loop or event emitter</span> <span data-start="302.88" data-end="304.86">and this technique can be applied to</span> <span data-start="304.86" data-end="307.26">those so the general gist is we've all</span> <span data-start="307.26" data-end="309.45">seen code like this while loop call back</span> <span data-start="309.45" data-end="311.52">call and what it's doing is it's doing</span> <span data-start="311.52" data-end="313.77">the dot call for the this the disarm</span> <span data-start="313.77" data-end="315.42">your this context but if you don't pass</span> <span data-start="315.42" data-end="317.91">it this context it's still or this argh</span> <span data-start="317.91" data-end="320.16">it's still doing a dot call and that is</span> <span data-start="320.16" data-end="322.26">slower than just a straight function</span> <span data-start="322.26" data-end="324.3">call so one way to do it like we all</span> <span data-start="324.3" data-end="327.09">know like when you have loops you move</span> <span data-start="327.09" data-end="330.51">the the hard work out of the loop and in</span> <span data-start="330.51" data-end="333.27">this case you can move that call out of</span> <span data-start="333.27" data-end="338.37">the loop by doing something like this so</span> <span data-start="338.37" data-end="342.83">this create call back allows you to</span> <span data-start="342.83" data-end="346.41">evaluate and do the binding inside this</span> <span data-start="346.41" data-end="349.74">function here and then in your main loop</span> <span data-start="349.74" data-end="352.23">you've just got a straight function call</span> <span data-start="352.23" data-end="355.74">and so that increases your your</span> <span data-start="355.74" data-end="358.17">iteration performance and your event</span> <span data-start="358.17" data-end="360.81">emitter performance and the inside of</span> <span data-start="360.81" data-end="361.98">that function there that I've</span> <span data-start="361.98" data-end="369.69">highlighted looks like this AHA there it</span> <span data-start="369.69" data-end="373.86">is like this if you don't pass it this</span> <span data-start="373.86" data-end="375.66">arc it just returns the call back and if</span> <span data-start="375.66" data-end="378.24">you do it wraps the function and does</span> <span data-start="378.24" data-end="381.18">the call now this makes your common case</span> <span data-start="381.18" data-end="383.31">very very fast and I'll show you I'll</span> <span data-start="383.31" data-end="386">step back this is I applied this</span> <span data-start="386" data-end="388.14">optimization to backbone which already</span> <span data-start="388.14" data-end="391.35">has a very fast event system like they</span> <span data-start="391.35" data-end="393.12">go out of their way to really fine-tune</span> <span data-start="393.12" data-end="395.82">it and you're still able to get</span> <span data-start="395.82" data-end="399.66">performance gains in various browsers</span> <span data-start="399.66" data-end="404.1">because of this and I'll step back or</span> <span data-start="404.1" data-end="408.21">forward there's trade-offs for this this</span> <span data-start="408.21" data-end="409.83">makes your comment case very fast this</span> <span data-start="409.83" data-end="411.63">makes your case where you pass at this</span> <span data-start="411.63" data-end="414.539">argh very slow because it is having to</span> <span data-start="414.539" data-end="416.1">do a function rapper so there's there's</span> <span data-start="416.1" data-end="417.99">variations you can do on this</span> <span data-start="417.99" data-end="420.3">what you can do is you can check to see</span> <span data-start="420.3" data-end="424.17">if there is if this file show you here</span> <span data-start="424.17" data-end="427.62">if there is a this binding and then in</span> <span data-start="427.62" data-end="430.8">your loop do a conditional sure like a</span> <span data-start="430.8" data-end="432.48">ternary operator that says hey if</span> <span data-start="432.48" data-end="435.15">there's a binding do the call if not or</span> <span data-start="435.15" data-end="437.49">do the function call wit call if not</span> <span data-start="437.49" data-end="439.8">then dude alcohol and that will give you</span> <span data-start="439.8" data-end="441.63">a little bit better performance and not</span> <span data-start="441.63" data-end="443.55">as bad a big of a per penalty so it's</span> <span data-start="443.55" data-end="445.23">just up to you to weigh the pros and</span> <span data-start="445.23" data-end="447.39">cons of your approach one of the good</span> <span data-start="447.39" data-end="451.43">things about using create callback is</span> <span data-start="451.43" data-end="455.43">that with this approach you could then</span> <span data-start="455.43" data-end="458.01">add extra functionality without having</span> <span data-start="458.01" data-end="459.99">to modify this function you could just</span> <span data-start="459.99" data-end="462.87">modify create call back so I did this</span> <span data-start="462.87" data-end="466.35">with lodash for our map function usually</span> <span data-start="466.35" data-end="467.64">there's a function called pluck which</span> <span data-start="467.64" data-end="469.38">would then you you give it a collection</span> <span data-start="469.38" data-end="472.17">or an array of objects let's say and you</span> <span data-start="472.17" data-end="474.75">want to get the the name property value</span> <span data-start="474.75" data-end="476.25">off of all the objects there's a</span> <span data-start="476.25" data-end="477.42">function called pluck which would do</span> <span data-start="477.42" data-end="479.63">that well instead you could have map</span> <span data-start="479.63" data-end="482.01">which we all know whatever a map is you</span> <span data-start="482.01" data-end="484.32">could have map that accepts a string a</span> <span data-start="484.32" data-end="487.23">string for callback and it would pass</span> <span data-start="487.23" data-end="488.94">here it would automatically create the</span> <span data-start="488.94" data-end="491.79">callback that does the object property</span> <span data-start="491.79" data-end="494.7">retrieval for you and it's at zero perf</span> <span data-start="494.7" data-end="497.34">cost so you're able to extend your your</span> <span data-start="497.34" data-end="499.95">existing iteration function without any</span> <span data-start="499.95" data-end="502.53">extra perf cost and it's optimized for</span> <span data-start="502.53" data-end="504.96">the common case so you get win win win</span> <span data-start="504.96" data-end="512.43">win win out of that</span> <span data-start="512.44" data-end="514.599">all right before i get into the next one</span> <span data-start="514.599" data-end="517.81">i also want to touch on event systems</span> <span data-start="517.81" data-end="520.18">like jquery so if we looked at back at</span> <span data-start="520.18" data-end="523.15">this chart here you saw that so this is</span> <span data-start="523.15" data-end="525.58">higher is better so the longer the bar</span> <span data-start="525.58" data-end="527.92">the better backbone alt is my</span> <span data-start="527.92" data-end="531.07">implementation you'll see like jquery's</span> <span data-start="531.07" data-end="533.41">version here there there event system is</span> <span data-start="533.41" data-end="535.6">considerably slower but they're doing a</span> <span data-start="535.6" data-end="537.37">lot more they've got a more robust event</span> <span data-start="537.37" data-end="538.9">system it's for handling elements it's</span> <span data-start="538.9" data-end="542.44">not just generic objects and with this</span> <span data-start="542.44" data-end="545.88">technique you can improve jquery's event</span> <span data-start="545.88" data-end="549.43">iteration by like eighteen percent which</span> <span data-start="549.43" data-end="551.5">considering how much other stuff they</span> <span data-start="551.5" data-end="553.87">have around just removing that call and</span> <span data-start="553.87" data-end="556.99">dot apply is a pretty easy tweak so if</span> <span data-start="556.99" data-end="558.91">anyone digs jquery wants to optimize</span> <span data-start="558.91" data-end="562.15">that this would help their event system</span> <span data-start="562.15" data-end="567.26">this would help their dot each cool</span> <span data-start="567.27" data-end="570.46">alright i really like this this</span> <span data-start="570.46" data-end="572.44">technique and so I you'll see a lot of</span> <span data-start="572.44" data-end="574.24">this stuff is I've taken out of low dash</span> <span data-start="574.24" data-end="577.12">because I'm not just like

data-end="799.35">probably safe to use all right let's see</span> <span data-start="799.35" data-end="801.48">this is me actually showing the inside</span> <span data-start="801.48" data-end="804.57">of the listener so before I showed how</span> <span data-start="804.57" data-end="805.98">to register it and this is an</span> <span data-start="805.98" data-end="808.8">implementation of it using that that</span> <span data-start="808.8" data-end="810.54">information now now that I know that I</span> <span data-start="810.54" data-end="813.54">can conditionally if there is a context</span> <span data-start="813.54" data-end="815.94">call it if not do a straight function</span> <span data-start="815.94" data-end="818.19">call and that is how you get your</span> <span data-start="818.19" data-end="820.67">performance now this is kind of like the</span> <span data-start="820.67" data-end="823.62">backbones implementation where they do a</span> <span data-start="823.62" data-end="825.99">switch statement on a number of</span> <span data-start="825.99" data-end="829.08">arguments I just did up to one but you</span> <span data-start="829.08" data-end="831.12">they do it like up to three you may</span> <span data-start="831.12" data-end="834.69">would do for it manuf eyes to almost</span> <span data-start="834.69" data-end="837.48">nothing so if you're totally grossed out</span> <span data-start="837.48" data-end="839.209">about that just say it's for perch and</span> <span data-start="839.209" data-end="848.18">and move on oh yeah okay all right so</span> <span data-start="848.18" data-end="851.97">the the next technique i have is reduce</span> <span data-start="851.97" data-end="854.1">your searches so a lot of people when</span> <span data-start="854.1" data-end="857.93">you they have a lot a large array or a</span> <span data-start="857.93" data-end="860.01">group of a race they want to do</span> <span data-start="860.01" data-end="865.94">operations like without or union or</span> <span data-start="865.94" data-end="869.67">unique on their arrays but that's doing</span> <span data-start="869.67" data-end="872.13">a lot of linear searches index of values</span> <span data-start="872.13" data-end="874.74">going through the collection every time</span> <span data-start="874.74" data-end="878.279">and that's very very slow and to fix</span> <span data-start="878.279" data-end="880.17">that you may think well i'll just use an</span> <span data-start="880.17" data-end="884.43">object cache so if the if the value in</span> <span data-start="884.43" data-end="887.16">this case turns the value into a</span> <span data-start="887.16" data-end="889.829">property name and they set its result to</span> <span data-start="889.829" data-end="892.079">true so then if it does exist as a</span> <span data-start="892.079" data-end="894.24">property then they know it's there and</span> <span data-start="894.24" data-end="896.25">they can they can continue on their way</span> <span data-start="896.25" data-end="899.37">they found the property or the value but</span> <span data-start="899.37" data-end="900.329">there's there's a couple of problems</span> <span data-start="900.329" data-end="902.64">with that it conflates things that look</span> <span data-start="902.64" data-end="905.73">like identical at strings so like the</span> <span data-start="905.73" data-end="908.25">number string are the number two and the</span> <span data-start="908.25" data-end="911.13">string to look the same and so</span> <span data-start="911.13" data-end="912.99">if you're doing something that's is like</span> <span data-start="912.99" data-end="914.91">a unique operation it's going to treat</span> <span data-start="914.91" data-end="917.58">them as equal when they are not or even</span> <span data-start="917.58" data-end="920.34">a function that coerced to the for some</span> <span data-start="920.34" data-end="922.14">reason course to a number it would with</span> <span data-start="922.14" data-end="924.54">two string would do it so that that</span> <span data-start="924.54" data-end="928.8">approach doesn't work well for generic</span> <span data-start="928.8" data-end="931.02">use now if that is your only use case</span> <span data-start="931.02" data-end="933.36">then maybe maybe you could do it but</span> <span data-start="933.36" data-end="935.34">this is how you could tweak that so</span> <span data-start="935.34" data-end="937.11">here's the first one where it's index of</span> <span data-start="937.11" data-end="941.34">and you'll also see that I've got a</span> <span data-start="941.34" data-end="943.32">little bit of something up here but I'll</span> <span data-start="943.32" data-end="946.77">talk about that later and then the the</span> <span data-start="946.77" data-end="949.32">tweak is what I've done is I've in this</span> <span data-start="949.32" data-end="952.62">example created a cache of that value</span> <span data-start="952.62" data-end="954.33">and then I just look to see if it's</span> <span data-start="954.33" data-end="958.35">contained in that cache or if it's not</span> <span data-start="958.35" data-end="961.38">contained in this case now I'm going to</span> <span data-start="961.38" data-end="962.55">go into actually showing you how i</span> <span data-start="962.55" data-end="965.7">create the object cache for that so this</span> <span data-start="965.7" data-end="968.25">is what the idea is is instead of doing</span> <span data-start="968.25" data-end="970.95">a long linear search you're breaking</span> <span data-start="970.95" data-end="972.87">that massive array into two smaller</span> <span data-start="972.87" data-end="976.11">buckets so you're taking all of the in</span> <span data-start="976.11" data-end="980.13">my previous example of two like values</span> <span data-start="980.13" data-end="981.72">so all of your number two's and string</span> <span data-start="981.72" data-end="983.76">tues and sticking them into a smaller</span> <span data-start="983.76" data-end="986.58">array so you have less of an array to</span> <span data-start="986.58" data-end="988.71">search so that should be faster and it</span> <span data-start="988.71" data-end="991.26">is it's considerably faster and so now</span> <span data-start="991.26" data-end="994.59">here's just a small code that shows you</span> <span data-start="994.59" data-end="998.07">an implementation of this what I do is I</span> <span data-start="998.07" data-end="1000.41">detect if the array is large and what is</span> <span data-start="1000.41" data-end="1004.87">large it's an arbitrary number that I've</span> <span data-start="1004.87" data-end="1008.81">created based on research so in my case</span> <span data-start="1008.81" data-end="1012.58">my implementation the large array size</span> <span data-start="1012.58" data-end="1016.37">was at one time 200 so anything over 200</span> <span data-start="1016.37" data-end="1018.89">got this optimization now it's reduced</span> <span data-start="1018.89" data-end="1021.98">to 75 so now any array over 75 gets this</span> <span data-start="1021.98" data-end="1025.52">optimization but what it is is it's the</span> <span data-start="1025.52" data-end="1029.35">point at which your cost for doing this</span> <span data-start="1029.35" data-end="1031.64">actually gives you a perf win because</span> <span data-start="1031.64" data-end="1033.439">you're having to sit there and create an</span> <span data-start="1033.439" data-end="1035.209">object and populate it with properties</span> <span data-start="1035.209" data-end="1038.12">and if you if your array is for items</span> <span data-start="1038.12" data-end="1040.1">long then it's not going to be a big not</span> <span data-start="1040.1" data-end="1041.63">going to be a win so what this is doing</span> <span data-start="1041.63" data-end="1044.75">is I'm doing a prefix here for the</span> <span data-start="1044.75" data-end="1047.209">you to avoid issues with object</span> <span data-start="1047.209" data-end="1050.21">properties on objects of prototype so to</span> <span data-start="1050.21"

<p><span data-start="1065.63" data-end="1068.15">I check to see if it is in that smaller</span> <span data-start="1068.15" data-end="1071.35">array so instead of doing let's say 200</span> <span data-start="1071.35" data-end="1073.82">search over 200 items it's doing a</span> <span data-start="1073.82" data-end="1077.62">search over four so it makes it faster</span> <span data-start="1077.62" data-end="1082.61">now this is me zooming into that chunk</span> <span data-start="1082.61" data-end="1084.29">right there that that is what's actually</span> <span data-start="1084.29" data-end="1087.05">creating the cash but it was pretty</span> <span data-start="1087.05" data-end="1091.1">pretty clear before so there's an</span> <span data-start="1091.1" data-end="1092.99">alternative technique that you can do</span> <span data-start="1092.99" data-end="1096.08">that takes it another step further and</span> <span data-start="1096.08" data-end="1097.34">this is what I'm doing in the next</span> <span data-start="1097.34" data-end="1099.92">version of lodash and what this is is</span> <span data-start="1099.92" data-end="1102.74">instead of creating a bunch of smaller</span> <span data-start="1102.74" data-end="1106.55">arrays what it's doing a hybrid approach</span> <span data-start="1106.55" data-end="1108.5">of that the first naive approach which</span> <span data-start="1108.5" data-end="1111.92">was to do object properties and it's</span> <span data-start="1111.92"

data-end="1122.87">true no  and I only do those</span> <span data-start="1122.87" data-end="1125.3">lookups if i'm looking for a value that</span> <span data-start="1125.3" data-end="1128.12">is one

data-start="1145.34" data-end="1147.05">if it's an object it's getting pushed</span> <span data-start="1147.05" data-end="1149.18">into the smaller array if it's one of</span> <span
