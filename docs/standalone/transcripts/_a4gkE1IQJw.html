this</span> <span data-start="312.82" data-end="315.37">all-in-one encompassing vision for it</span> <span data-start="315.37" data-end="317.65">and it turned out that what people</span> <span data-start="317.65" data-end="320.53">really wanted was to take parts of it</span> <span data-start="320.53" data-end="323.11">and use it in their own application so</span> <span data-start="323.11" data-end="324.4">we really wanted to make that a first</span> <span data-start="324.4" data-end="327.4">class citizen and I think we've done</span> <span data-start="327.4" data-end="332.83">really well so as of today we've got two</span> <span data-start="332.83" data-end="335.88">supported uses for skywriter the first</span> <span data-start="335.88" data-end="338.02">basically supported way to use guy right</span> <span data-start="338.02" data-end="338.76">oh right now it</span> <span data-start="338.76" data-end="340.35">the bookmarklet actually which is a very</span> <span data-start="340.35" data-end="342.45">simple way that I can demo that right</span> <span data-start="342.45" data-end="345.36">here oh well first I'll mention that you</span> <span data-start="345.36" data-end="346.47">can get it from vestment that mozilla</span> <span data-start="346.47" data-end="350.28">labs com / bookmarklet but here is</span> <span data-start="350.28" data-end="351.74">basically the page that you'll see there</span> <span data-start="351.74" data-end="353.88">so the number way you use it as you drag</span> <span data-start="353.88" data-end="355.95">this up to your bookmarks bar but I'll</span> <span data-start="355.95" data-end="357.21">just click it right here so I can demo</span> <span data-start="357.21" data-end="359.04">it in the page but basically what</span> <span data-start="359.04" data-end="360.3">happens is if you find a text area</span> <span data-start="360.3" data-end="361.8">somewhere like if you go to just or</span> <span data-start="361.8" data-end="363.78">whatever you find a text area here's a</span> <span data-start="363.78" data-end="365.07">plain text area and you hover over it</span> <span data-start="365.07" data-end="366.84">you'll see this little Bespin logo</span> <span data-start="366.84" data-end="368.34">appear next to it when you've clicked on</span> <span data-start="368.34" data-end="369.9">the bookmarklet so I can click that and</span> <span data-start="369.9" data-end="371.55">it will convert the text area into a</span> <span data-start="371.55" data-end="373.44">better text editor right there one that</span> <span data-start="373.44" data-end="375.3">you can choose a language for syntax</span> <span data-start="375.3" data-end="377.43">highlighting you can switch themes if</span> <span data-start="377.43" data-end="381.42">you want so that works pretty in almost</span> <span data-start="381.42" data-end="383.07">all cases you know if you're coming to</span> <span data-start="383.07" data-end="384.69">come across a random text area and you</span> <span data-start="384.69" data-end="386.73">say boy I wish I had a better editor you</span> <span data-start="386.73" data-end="387.9">can click the bookmarklet and get a</span> <span data-start="387.9" data-end="392.43">better editor right there so the next</span> <span data-start="392.43" data-end="396.21">case add yes so you made in case this is</span> <span data-start="396.21" data-end="397.35">when you want to upgrade your own</span> <span data-start="397.35" data-end="399">website rather than upgrading the</span> <span data-start="399" data-end="402.9">website of somebody else so how do you</span> <span data-start="402.9" data-end="406.17">embed best been on on your pages and</span> <span data-start="406.17" data-end="408.18">pretty much I think if you trying to</span> <span data-start="408.18" data-end="411.09">imagine what you would like how you</span> <span data-start="411.09" data-end="412.53">would like it so that you had best been</span> <span data-start="412.53" data-end="414.63">to your pages with one tiny exception</span> <span data-start="414.63" data-end="416.52">that's pretty much exactly what you do</span> <span data-start="416.52" data-end="420.18">you have to download some stuff and</span> <span data-start="420.18" data-end="422.34">we'll talk in a bit about how to do</span> <span data-start="422.34" data-end="425.22">custom builds if you need it but so</span> <span data-start="425.22" data-end="426.27">there's your page before any</span> <span data-start="426.27" data-end="428.64">modifications you probably going to be</span> <span data-start="428.64" data-end="430.74">slightly more complicated than this but</span> <span data-start="430.74" data-end="432.99">you're going to have some text area or</span> <span data-start="432.99" data-end="434.46">something that you want to upgrade it</span> <span data-start="434.46" data-end="438.18">doesn't have to be a text area so if you</span> <span data-start="438.18" data-end="439.98">if you wish to turn that text area into</span> <span data-start="439.98" data-end="443.4">a best bin text area then you have to</span> <span data-start="443.4" data-end="445.2">import best bin so the thing that you</span> <span data-start="445.2" data-end="446.61">perhaps might not have guessed is this</span> <span data-start="446.61" data-end="449.4">link thing so that we can get at other</span> <span data-start="449.4" data-end="451.53">resources but obviously you're going to</span> <span data-start="451.53" data-end="455.97">need a script and you're going to have a</span> <span data-start="455.97" data-end="458.19">class of best bin which you enter text</span> <span data-start="458.19" data-end="460.86">area now I would say we've not yet done</span> <span data-start="460.86" data-end="464.28">a release of skywriter in fact we</span> <span data-start="464.28" data-end="466.23">haven't even reason we change the name</span> <span data-start="466.23" data-end="468.94">is because lucasarts of</span> <span data-start="468.94" data-end="470.74">scary with their lawyers they have lots</span> <span data-start="470.74" data-end="474.36">of lawyers and they're very pointy and</span> <span data-start="474.36" data-end="478.12">they had a trademark on Bespin and they</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="479.83">let it lapse but they also go around</span> <span data-start="479.83" data-end="482.41">suing people for stuff than trademarks</span> <span data-start="482.41" data-end="485.38">so we thought where we're going to we</span> <span data-start="485.38" data-end="487.9">have to change the night so the next</span> <span data-start="487.9" data-end="489.07">release that we make will be called</span> <span data-start="489.07" data-end="490.96">skywriter we haven't done a skywriter</span> <span data-start="490.96" data-end="493.45">release yet which is why for the letter</span> <span data-start="493.45" data-end="496.51">the most recent release which still</span> <span data-start="496.51" data-end="501.13">class equals best bin and your page</span> <span data-start="501.13" data-end="502.48">suddenly looks like that that's all you</span> <span data-start="502.48" data-end="508.93">need to do very very easy so we have</span> <span data-start="508.93" data-end="512.469">custom builds that was a very simple</span> <span data-start="512.469" data-end="515.2">example and Bespin has a lot of features</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="515.2" data-end="517.99">Bespin has so many features that we</span> <span data-start="517.99" data-end="520.45">decided to split it out into plugins and</span> <span data-start="520.45" data-end="523.57">shoot so that you can not only choose</span> <span data-start="523.57" data-end="526.12">the ones that you that you want for</span> <span data-start="526.12" data-end="527.5">example syntax highlighting you might</span> <span data-start="527.5" data-end="529">not want all the syntax highlighters in</span> <span data-start="529" data-end="530.62">there but you can also write your own</span> <span data-start="530.62" data-end="532.57">and to integrate that with whatever</span> <span data-start="532.57" data-end="535.84">environments so it's really customizable</span> <span data-start="535.84" data-end="536.92">I'm just going to give a simple example</span> <span data-start="536.92" data-end="539.5">of how you do that so we have what's</span> <span data-start="539.5" data-end="542.65">called this manifest it's just a JSON</span> <span data-start="542.65" data-end="545.86">file that you give to a tool that we</span> <span data-start="545.86" data-end="550.27">call dry ice and here's an example of</span> <span data-start="550.27" data-end="553.93">another manifest so it just tells dry</span> <span data-start="553.93" data-end="556.93">ice which is our build tool where to put</span> <span data-start="556.93" data-end="559.75">the output and what plugins you wants</span> <span data-start="559.75"

data-end="1103.53">want to bring that up you lost your</span> <span data-start="1103.53" data-end="1109.25">metadata at the top there</span> <span data-start="1109.26" data-end="1113.95">just now I've reloaded it am I yeah well</span> <span data-start="1113.95" data-end="1117.34">just yeah he cut it so when you don't</span> <span data-start="1117.34" data-end="1118.66">have a server involved it makes it a lot</span> <span data-start="1118.66" data-end="1122.35">harder to reload a file but we have the</span> <span data-start="1122.35" data-end="1130.42">clipboard so Wow okay all right and you</span> <span data-start="1130.42" data-end="1133.81">need your end tag that under the</span> <span data-start="1133.81" data-end="1139.6">metadata okay so now we're going to get</span> <span data-start="1139.6" data-end="1140.95">into the writing the code of our plugin</span> <span data-start="1140.95" data-end="1143.29">and it's going to be actually a pretty</span> <span data-start="1143.29" data-end="1145.15">straightforward plug into right so the</span> <span data-start="1145.15" data-end="1146.38">first thing that we're going to need to</span> <span data-start="1146.38" data-end="1148.27">use is the environment we're going to be</span> <span data-start="1148.27" data-end="1149.98">using that to get at that's the</span> <span data-start="1149.98" data-end="1151.48">environment module basically investment</span> <span data-start="1151.48" data-end="1154.3">will give you access to the various</span> <span data-start="1154.3" data-end="1155.47">parts of the best environment so the</span> <span data-start="1155.47" data-end="1156.67">different things like the text editor</span> <span data-start="1156.67" data-end="1158.95">itself and other resources that are</span> <span data-start="1158.95" data-end="1161.02">available within it then we're going to</span> <span data-start="1161.02" data-end="1164.41">import our markdown library so the one</span> <span data-start="1164.41" data-end="1166.57">that we just said we depend on we know</span> <span data-start="1166.57" data-end="1167.74">it's going to be available so we will</span> <span data-start="1167.74" data-end="1172.15">import it now so now we're going to</span> <span data-start="1172.15" data-end="1173.77">create a function so we say export</span> <span data-start="1173.77" data-end="1175.81">previews the name previews the name of</span> <span data-start="1175.81" data-end="1177.25">our function we're going to export it so</span> <span data-start="1177.25" data-end="1178.69">this is all common jas format for people</span> <span data-start="1178.69" data-end="1180.61">who aren't familiar with it I guess</span> <span data-start="1180.61" data-end="1182.14">there's so many note users that people</span> <span data-start="1182.14" data-end="1183.42">are probably from where is it by now</span> <span data-start="1183.42" data-end="1186.1">exports that preview equals function all</span> <span data-start="1186.1" data-end="1189.1">of our command functions so we have the</span> <span data-start="1189.1" data-end="1190.65">concept of a command which actually</span> <span data-start="1190.65" data-end="1192.82">defines pretty much anything you do in</span> <span data-start="1192.82" data-end="1194.44">the editor including like cursor</span> <span data-start="1194.44" data-end="1196.78">movements and things like that are all</span> <span data-start="1196.78" data-end="1199.54">commands so the the basic functionality</span> <span data-start="1199.54" data-end="1203.46">of the editor all follows along with</span> <span data-start="1203.46" data-end="1206.17">with that same pattern so so you can</span> <span data-start="1206.17" data-end="1207.34">extend the editor in the same ways that</span> <span data-start="1207.34" data-end="1208.56">we built the editor in the first place</span> <span data-start="1208.56" data-end="1211.84">so right now we're taking a making a</span> <span data-start="1211.84" data-end="1213.79">command function that includes arguments</span> <span data-start="1213.79" data-end="1215.14">that's the the stuff coming into the</span> <span data-start="1215.14" data-end="1216.7">command and a request object which is</span> <span data-start="1216.7" data-end="1219.22">allows you to send stuff back out from</span> <span data-start="1219.22" data-end="1222.43">the command and basically we've got</span> <span data-start="1222.43" data-end="1224.83">we're going to get the text as either</span> <span data-start="1224.83" data-end="1226.36">the selected text so we ask the</span> <span data-start="1226.36" data-end="1227.65">environment for the editor and then we</span> <span data-start="1227.65" data-end="1229.45">ask the editor for its selected text if</span> <span data-start="1229.45" data-end="1230.86">it doesn't have any selected text will</span> <span data-start="1230.86" data-end="1232.21">go ahead and take the whole file which</span> <span data-start="1232.21" data-end="1235.6">is just envy dead eter you if you use</span> <span data-start="1235.6" data-end="1237.67">text area objects you've seen that</span> <span data-start="1237.67" data-end="1239.41">they've responded value just like</span> <span data-start="1239.41" data-end="1242.89">our editor does so once we have the text</span> <span data-start="1242.89" data-end="1245.38">in hand that from the editor we can then</span> <span data-start="1245.38" data-end="1247.78">basically create a pop-up window so</span> <span data-start="1247.78" data-end="1249.7">we're just going to open up a blank new</span> <span data-start="1249.7" data-end="1250.93">window and we're going to use that</span> <span data-start="1250.93" data-end="1253.39">window is our preview window and then</span> <span data-start="1253.39" data-end="1255.49">we're going to set the document body</span> <span data-start="1255.49" data-end="1257.77">enter HTML to be the converted markdown</span> <span data-start="1257.77" data-end="1259.69">so we're going to go ahead and run the</span> <span data-start="1259.69" data-end="1261.49">conversion function mark down at to HTML</span> <span data-start="1261.49" data-end="1263.53">text and then once you're done with your</span> <span data-start="1263.53" data-end="1266.23">request you can say request done the</span> <span data-start="1266.23" data-end="1267.52">reason we have to do this is because we</span> <span data-start="1267.52" data-end="1269.32">have a lot of requests commands that are</span> <span data-start="1269.32" data-end="1270.76">actually asynchronous so you'll have to</span> <span data-start="1270.76" data-end="1273.04">say request dot or if you're not done to</span> <span data-start="1273.04" data-end="1274.54">me basically you have to wait until you</span> <span data-start="1274.54" data-end="1276.76">are done to say request done that way</span> <span data-start="1276.76" data-end="1277.99">the editor knows that the command line</span> <span data-start="1277.99" data-end="1279.91">knows that you're not done yet and it</span> <span data-start="1279.91" data-end="1281.59">will provide a little spinner and stuff</span> <span data-start="1281.59" data-end="1285.7">like that so at this point we've gone</span> <span data-start="1285.7" data-end="1287.56">ahead and defined the command function</span> <span data-start="1287.56" data-end="1290.05">but we haven't really told the best bit</span> <span data-start="1290.05" data-end="1291.52">environment anything about it like</span> <span data-start="1291.52" data-end="1294.82">nothing actually knows it exists so what</span> <span data-start="1294.82" data-end="1297.16">we've got is this system of extension</span> <span data-start="1297.16" data-end="1299.5">points so we've got an extension point</span> <span data-start="1299.5" data-end="1301.39">called command and basically we've got</span> <span data-start="1301.39" data-end="1302.74">an extension that we've made for command</span> <span data-start="1302.74" data-end="1305.11">here and what we're doing right now is</span> <span data-start="1305.11" data-end="1307.03">in the metadata we're telling the editor</span> <span data-start="1307.03" data-end="1308.83">about that now the advantage of using</span> <span data-start="1308.83" data-end="1310.84">the system is that in a server</span> <span data-start="1310.84" data-end="1313.72">environment or actually really in any</span> <span data-start="1313.72"
