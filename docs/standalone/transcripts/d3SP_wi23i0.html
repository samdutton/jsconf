data-end="463.43">know Google says the same thing this is</span> <span data-start="463.43" data-end="466.009">from Google's material design page and</span> <span data-start="466.009" data-end="470.18">they say okay if you have an app then</span> <span data-start="470.18" data-end="472.699">you need to show some elements at the</span> <span data-start="472.699"

data-start="524.66" data-end="527.09">and in a sense it isn't but there is</span> <span data-start="527.09" data-end="529.25">some trick to the implementation it's</span> <span data-start="529.25" data-end="531.32">not as straightforward as you might</span> <span data-start="531.32" data-end="533.21">think and I'll show you how to implement</span> <span data-start="533.21" data-end="536.27">this in various in a bit in a few</span> <span data-start="536.27" data-end="539.72">different ways but first like let's take</span> <span data-start="539.72" data-end="541.94">inventory of what are you going to do so</span> <span data-start="541.94" data-end="544.4">we have four circles y 4 and not 3</span> <span data-start="544.4" data-end="547.43">because one always exit stage right and</span> <span data-start="547.43" data-end="550.61">one enters stage left and there's a</span> <span data-start="550.61"

data-end="557.3">that's one second there is a circle</span> <span data-start="557.3" data-end="559.13">movement time how much time does each</span> <span data-start="559.13" data-end="562.4">circle take to move that's 0.5 seconds</span> <span data-start="562.4" data-end="564.38">and there is the stagger time which is</span> <span data-start="564.38" data-end="566.6">how much time does each

<span data-start="572.42" data-end="576.08">our animation and I'm going to show</span> <span data-start="576.08" data-end="577.73">three different options on how to</span> <span data-start="577.73" data-end="580.19">implement them these are not the only</span> <span data-start="580.19" data-end="582.41">options but these are the options that I</span> <span data-start="582.41"
