data-end="209">because we wrote a really crappy code</span> <span data-start="209" data-end="210.98">just to make it pass and over and over</span> <span data-start="210.98" data-end="213.739">over again and it's addictively fun to</span> <span data-start="213.739" data-end="216.829">to code this way but it's really really</span> <span data-start="216.829" data-end="219.98">hard to get people in in the air prize</span> <span data-start="219.98" data-end="221.69">at least or we like when you have a day</span> <span data-start="221.69" data-end="222.92">job and you have to get your stuff done</span> <span data-start="222.92" data-end="225.56">you know I can't get my stuff done and I</span> <span data-start="225.56" data-end="227.51">don't test like I I'm really bad out</span> <span data-start="227.51" data-end="229.25">test all the time I wish I did test all</span> <span data-start="229.25" data-end="232.609">the time I love testing but it's hard to</span> <span data-start="232.609" data-end="234.29">do that without having a group of people</span> <span data-start="234.29" data-end="236.69">that also love testing so that's why I</span> <span data-start="236.69" data-end="238.01">preach on testing because I want other</span> <span data-start="238.01" data-end="240.23">people to to get excited about it and</span> <span data-start="240.23" data-end="242.389">the entire concept beach n red greening</span> <span data-start="242.389" data-end="244.31">factor is really my ideal working</span> <span data-start="244.31"

that that seems like the best</span> <span data-start="250.85" data-end="254.45">case scenario in my opinion but the</span> <span data-start="254.45" data-end="257.9">problem is legacy code so like this is</span> <span data-start="257.9" data-end="259.43">really great in Greenfield stuff and</span> <span data-start="259.43" data-end="261.32">like you know it's all fairies and</span> <span

data-end="274.34">crappy code in there and like how can I</span> <span data-start="274.34" data-end="277.849">test that well it's it's about testing</span> <span data-start="277.849" data-end="280.909">little tiny things at once right and you</span> <span data-start="280.909" data-end="282.11">guys probably already knows the ones</span> <span data-start="282.11" data-end="283.249">that are testing at least</span> <span data-start="283.249" data-end="285.649">that if you have a piece of legacy code</span> <span data-start="285.649" data-end="287.629">you have a bug right chest that proves</span> <span data-start="287.629" data-end="291.199">your bug exists and that's like a little</span> <span data-start="291.199" data-end="292.939">tiny thing you can do

data-start="308.899" data-end="310.369">it better but you know what happens is</span> <span data-start="310.369" data-end="313.099">that when when I don't write test if I</span> <span data-start="313.099" data-end="314.149">don't write a test for a thing i sent</span> <span data-start="314.149" data-end="316.489">off the QA curious like you didn't fix</span> <span data-start="316.489" data-end="319.489">it and like oh no so that kind of sucks</span> <span data-start="319.489" data-end="322.159">and the right knee chest really helps</span> <span
