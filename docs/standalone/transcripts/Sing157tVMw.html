data-end="236.18">to pay it forward</span> <span data-start="236.18" data-end="239.18">so I'm trying to learn how to find the</span> <span data-start="239.18" data-end="240.919">joy in watching other people achieve</span> <span data-start="240.919" data-end="242.959">their goals and supporting them along</span> <span data-start="242.959" data-end="245.659">their way towards that goal and

data-end="257.72">understand that and even after years of</span> <span data-start="257.72" data-end="261.799">working on it I still fail sometimes for</span> <span data-start="261.799" data-end="264.05">example a new junior developer was added</span> <span data-start="264.05" data-end="266.21">to my team about a month ago</span> <span data-start="266.21" data-end="269.09">and before that me as the current least</span> <span data-start="269.09" data-end="271.25">experienced developer on the team was</span> <span data-start="271.25" data-end="274.94">like immediately freaked out and I kept</span> <span data-start="274.94" data-end="277.13">asking questions like okay but what if</span> <span data-start="277.13" data-end="278.93">she comes in and she's better than me or</span> <span data-start="278.93" data-end="279.949">what if she comes in and she's better</span> <span data-start="279.949" data-end="281.99">than me now and like wouldn't that be</span> <span data-start="281.99" data-end="283.49">really embarrassing will I still get a</span> <span data-start="283.49" data-end="287.479">promotion like I spiraled really but now</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="287.479" data-end="289.639">I'm able to recognize those feelings and</span> <span data-start="289.639" data-end="292.22">not let them consume me because I know</span> <span data-start="292.22" data-end="295.34">that they're misleading and even if</span> <span data-start="295.34" data-end="297.86">something does go wrong I now have a</span> <span data-start="297.86" data-end="300.4">support system to help me through it and</span> <span data-start="300.4" data-end="302.539">I would have never learned how to do</span> <span data-start="302.539" data-end="304.58">this without the community to teach me</span> <span data-start="304.58" data-end="309.35">that this is even possible so thank you</span> <span data-start="309.35" data-end="312.25">[Applause]</span> </p>
