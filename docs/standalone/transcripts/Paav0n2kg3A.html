Patrick</span> <span data-start="12.58" data-end="14.559">country and we are both members of</span> <span data-start="14.559" data-end="16.779">mozillas Bespin team so we're gonna be</span> <span data-start="16.779" data-end="19.39">talking about betta vestments best in</span> <span data-start="19.39" data-end="21.81">today and this is best bin whoops</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="25.839">there's messmann screens a little bit</span> <span data-start="25.839" data-end="28.119">tall but best bended basically a text</span> <span data-start="28.119" data-end="29.109">editor that runs in your browser</span> <span data-start="29.109" data-end="31.06">specifically a programmers editor that</span> <span data-start="31.06" data-end="33.04">runs in your browser the whole idea that</span> <span data-start="33.04" data-end="36.989">you can write code manipulate it and</span> <span data-start="36.989" data-end="39.039">we'll see why you might want to do that</span> <span data-start="39.039" data-end="40.809">so why would you want to do that there</span> <span data-start="40.809" data-end="44.32">are actually a bunch of reasons so one</span> <span data-start="44.32" data-end="46.96">is that the web is a great open platform</span> <span data-start="46.96" data-end="48.219">that we've you know we've all come to</span> <span data-start="48.219" data-end="50.859">know and love and why not have our</span> <span data-start="50.859" data-end="52.059">developer tools built on that same</span> <span data-start="52.059" data-end="55">platform that we're developing for at</span> <span data-start="55" data-end="56.35">this point the platform's gotten to the</span> <span data-start="56.35" data-end="57.69">point where we can do that kind of thing</span> <span data-start="57.69" data-end="61.32">and is getting even better with html5</span> <span data-start="61.32" data-end="64.03">html5 is actually as a whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="64.03" data-end="66.37">features that really do add a lot to the</span> <span data-start="66.37" data-end="68.29">platform now if you ask these guys is</span> <span data-start="68.29" data-end="70.21">html5 ready yet demo tell you it's not</span> <span data-start="70.21" data-end="73.21">gonna be ready until 20 22 but they're</span> <span data-start="73.21" data-end="75.729">wrong html5 is ready today as long as</span> <span data-start="75.729" data-end="77.59">you know what your users are like if</span> <span data-start="77.59" data-end="79.119">your users are among the thirty-five to</span> <span data-start="79.119" data-end="80.829">forty percent of the people running an</span> <span data-start="80.829" data-end="83.53">html5 compatible browser then yes this</span> <span data-start="83.53" data-end="84.759">is the time to start using this stuff</span> <span data-start="84.759" data-end="85.93">because there's a lot of great api's</span> <span data-start="85.93" data-end="87.46">here and I know that there's been a</span> <span data-start="87.46" data-end="89.229">bunch of other talks that have touched</span> <span data-start="89.229" data-end="92.35">on an html5 so we take we take advantage</span> <span data-start="92.35" data-end="94.299">of those api's investment because we</span> <span data-start="94.299" data-end="96.759">know that probably everybody in this</span> <span data-start="96.759" data-end="98.17">room unless there's somebody in string</span> <span data-start="98.17" data-end="103.93">will work for Microsoft cool then okay</span> <span data-start="103.93" data-end="108.759">doesn't have canvas yeah we should talk</span> <span data-start="108.759" data-end="114.659">don't worry um okay well anyway I so so</span> <span data-start="114.659" data-end="117.7">people in this room most likely who our</span> <span data-start="117.7" data-end="119.32">target target audience for best been are</span> <span data-start="119.32" data-end="122.14">likely using compatible browsers and so</span> <span data-start="122.14" data-end="123.46">another reason why is that there are</span> <span data-start="123.46" data-end="126.07">lots of cases of this on the web this is</span> <span data-start="126.07" data-end="128.229">a shot from WordPress theme editor where</span> <span data-start="128.229" data-end="130.149">you edit code in a text area which is</span> <span data-start="130.149" data-end="133.15">really really crappy so there are a lot</span> <span data-start="133.15" data-end="134.44">of cases like that these days where you</span> <span data-start="134.44" data-end="135.91">have some code that you want to edit in</span> <span data-start="135.91" data-end="138.069">a browser and we want we have a best</span> <span data-start="138.069" data-end="138.76">been embedded</span> <span data-start="138.76" data-end="139.9">gage that's kind of designed for this</span> <span data-start="139.9" data-end="141.4">purpose so you can actually pick up that</span> <span data-start="141.4" data-end="144.37">package stick it on your server and just</span> <span data-start="144.37" data-end="146.86">all just JavaScript and it will you can</span> <span data-start="146.86" data-end="148.269">replace your text areas with something</span> <span data-start="148.269" data-end="152.65">better one of the other use cases is is</span> <span data-start="152.65" data-end="154.51">basically being able to get access to</span> <span data-start="154.51" data-end="155.739">your code wherever you are so if you</span> <span data-start="155.739" data-end="157.629">have actually like the best BIM server</span> <span data-start="157.629" data-end="159.069">environment where you can code in the</span> <span data-start="159.069" data-end="161.14">cloud the idea is you can go to any</span> <span data-start="161.14" data-end="164.14">computer sit down there and have you no</span> <span data-start="164.14" data-end="165.31">immediate access to everything you're</span> <span data-start="165.31" data-end="167.2">already working on this is not one of</span> <span data-start="167.2" data-end="168.4">the things that I was originally geeked</span> <span data-start="168.4" data-end="170.4">about when it came to besten but</span> <span data-start="170.4" data-end="172.12">repeatedly I've heard from college</span> <span data-start="172.12" data-end="173.5">students they really like this aspect</span> <span data-start="173.5" data-end="177.569">and you know as we get start getting</span> <span data-start="177.569" data-end="180.19">devices of different form factors where</span> <span data-start="180.19" data-end="181.659">you might want to access your code in</span> <span data-start="181.659" data-end="184.359">the cloud you know these these kinds of</span> <span data-start="184.359" data-end="187.06">things phones and bigger phones are</span> <span data-start="187.06" data-end="189.129">going to become really really</span> <span data-start="189.129" data-end="190.9">interesting for coding wherever you are</span> <span data-start="190.9" data-end="191.95">and they want to really have all your</span> <span data-start="191.95" data-end="194.019">files on there so that is actually a</span> <span data-start="194.019" data-end="195.76">growing use case and it is the number</span> <span data-start="195.76" data-end="199.72">one request I'm uservoice yes ipad</span> <span data-start="199.72" data-end="200.98">support for best bin is actually the</span> <span data-start="200.98" data-end="202.329">number one request under user for say</span> <span data-start="202.329" data-end="204.72">right now so that's kind of interesting</span> <span data-start="204.72" data-end="207.37">remote pair programming it you know most</span> <span data-start="207.37" data-end="208.989">of the way that we collaborate by and</span> <span data-start="208.989" data-end="210.609">large Morganne code is through version</span> <span data-start="210.609" data-end="212.859">control systems but there are times and</span> <span data-start="212.859" data-end="214.03">its really nice to be able to sit down</span> <span data-start="214.03" data-end="215.709">with somebody else on a piece of code</span> <span data-start="215.709" data-end="216.91">that and they're not necessarily in the</span> <span data-start="216.91" data-end="219.099">same time zone with you which actually</span> <span data-start="219.099" data-end="220.51">is a case on the best been team every</span> <span data-start="220.51" data-end="221.739">single number the team is a different</span> <span data-start="221.739" data-end="224.56">time zone it's really nice to be able to</span> <span data-start="224.56" data-end="227.019">code collaboratively right now the</span> <span data-start="227.019" data-end="229.18">current shipping version of best been we</span> <span data-start="229.18" data-end="230.62">are actually the process of getting the</span> <span data-start="230.62" data-end="234.329">collaboration features to a new state so</span> <span data-start="234.329" data-end="236.65">this is a use case that very soon we're</span> <span data-start="236.65" data-end="239.59">gonna have a good answer for so one of</span> <span data-start="239.59" data-end="240.519">the things that makes best been</span> <span data-start="240.519" data-end="243.22">different from the many many other ones</span> <span data-start="243.22" data-end="244.87">we're kind of going after the big major</span> <span data-start="244.87" data-end="246.419">editors that people live in all day</span> <span data-start="246.419" data-end="249.159">they're probably 403 I'm just making</span> <span data-start="249.159" data-end="250.15">this number up there are a large number</span> <span data-start="250.15" data-end="252.25">of code editors that people have already</span> <span data-start="252.25" data-end="255.43">written for the browser but the thing is</span> <span data-start="255.43" data-end="258.639">most of them are kind of avoiding going</span> <span data-start="258.639" data-end="261.51">after the big guys they don't actually</span> <span data-start="261.51" data-end="263.71">try to make an environment they try to</span> <span data-start="263.71" data-end="265.539">make an environment that's good for you</span> <span data-start="265.539" data-end="267.88">know quick bits of code not so much for</span> <span data-start="267.88" data-end="270.07">the things that you do the better that</span> <span data-start="270.07" data-end="270.38">you leave</span> <span data-start="270.38" data-end="271.96">an all day long and writing code so</span> <span data-start="271.96" data-end="273.86">we're trying to go after some of those</span> <span data-start="273.86" data-end="275.69">things so what are some of those things</span> <span data-start="275.69" data-end="276.77">some of those things are like</span> <span data-start="276.77" data-end="278.87">customizability obviously for all</span> <span data-start="278.87" data-end="280.43">programmers and we're all working on</span> <span data-start="280.43" data-end="281.57">different kinds of projects we want to</span> <span data-start="281.57" data-end="283.64">be able to make our tools do the right</span> <span data-start="283.64" data-end="285.88">things for our projects so</span> <span data-start="285.88" data-end="287.78">customizability is a big thing in any</span> <span data-start="287.78" data-end="289.01">one of those editors I just mentioned</span> <span data-start="289.01" data-end="290.15">you know if you look at textmate there</span> <span data-start="290.15" data-end="291.56">hasn't been a real text me release for a</span> <span data-start="291.56" data-end="293.06">long time but there are new bundles</span> <span data-start="293.06" data-end="294.14">coming out all the time to do all kinds</span> <span data-start="294.14" data-end="296.57">of stuff syntax highlighting I mean that</span> <span data-start="296.57" data-end="298.1">you know even the basic web editors do</span> <span data-start="298.1" data-end="300.08">that but it's pretty critical because</span> <span data-start="300.08" data-end="301.25">you know it makes it a lot easier to</span> <span data-start="301.25" data-end="302.93">read your code good use of keyboard</span> <span data-start="302.93" data-end="304.64">since we use the keyboard we hate</span> <span data-start="304.64" data-end="306.85">reaching for the mice when we have to</span> <span data-start="306.85" data-end="309.02">behave well for code like indentation</span> <span data-start="309.02" data-end="310.4">that's one of the most annoying things</span> <span data-start="310.4" data-end="312.2">about text areas obviously is that you</span> <span data-start="312.2" data-end="313.91">know you can't hit tab and if you you</span> <span data-start="313.91" data-end="314.84">know it doesn't keep your indentation</span> <span data-start="314.84" data-end="316.91">level and all that kind of stuff and</span> <span data-start="316.91" data-end="319.01">these things since they have since</span> <span data-start="319.01" data-end="320.33">they're very customizable and a lot of</span> <span data-start="320.33" data-end="321.25">these editors been around for years</span> <span data-start="321.25" data-end="324.38">there's usually lots lots more that</span> <span data-start="324.38" data-end="326.81">these editors do for you and we're</span> <span data-start="326.81" data-end="327.98">trying to get best been to the point</span> <span data-start="327.98" data-end="330.02">where we can actually be competitive at</span> <span data-start="330.02" data-end="332">that level yeah a lot of editors have</span> <span data-start="332" data-end="333.77">scripting languages and being in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="333.77" data-end="335.18">JavaScript we have the advantage of</span> <span data-start="335.18" data-end="337.07">having a scripting language already</span> <span data-start="337.07" data-end="343.43">there for us thankfully yes sure you</span> <span data-start="343.43" data-end="345.26">guys thinking about a shell extension</span> <span data-start="345.26" data-end="346.97">like with text me there's a meat</span> <span data-start="346.97" data-end="350.279">extension where your</span> <span data-start="350.289" data-end="353.499">and in a file that's conceivably</span> <span data-start="353.499" data-end="356.379">possible in like some specific depending</span> <span data-start="356.379" data-end="357.849">on the packaging's investment i mean if</span> <span data-start="357.849" data-end="358.749">there are lots of different ways to</span> <span data-start="358.749" data-end="359.889">package this up and that would be one</span> <span data-start="359.889" data-end="362.199">one possibility i'll go into more detail</span> <span data-start="362.199" data-end="365.71">on the packaging at the end so on the</span> <span data-start="365.71" data-end="367.689">customizability front you know we've</span> <span data-start="367.689" data-end="369.639">just been we've been actually for the</span> <span data-start="369.639" data-end="371.229">past several months completely</span> <span data-start="371.229" data-end="373.259">overhauling the way best been works and</span> <span data-start="373.259" data-end="374.889">customizability is one of the big</span> <span data-start="374.889" data-end="376.689">factors so we have we created up a</span> <span data-start="376.689" data-end="378.52">plug-in system for best bin that</span> <span data-start="378.52" data-end="380.83">basically each plug-in has a bunch of</span> <span data-start="380.83" data-end="383.349">metadata that says what it does Intel's</span> <span data-start="383.349" data-end="384.52">best me what does and all that metadata</span> <span data-start="384.52" data-end="386.259">gets eagerly loaded up to the browser so</span> <span data-start="386.259" data-end="388.18">as soon as you had best been best been</span> <span data-start="388.18" data-end="389.74">knows all the functionalities available</span> <span data-start="389.74" data-end="390.969">but it doesn't load all that</span> <span data-start="390.969" data-end="392.559">functionality until you need it so you</span> <span data-start="392.559" data-end="394.449">can have 50 syntax highlighters for you</span> <span data-start="394.449" data-end="396.49">know different languages and only once</span> <span data-start="396.49" data-end="398.439">and none of those get loaded until you</span> <span data-start="398.439" data-end="400.3">actually open a file in that language so</span> <span data-start="400.3" data-end="402.699">that saves all a lot of loading and</span> <span data-start="402.699" data-end="404.169">these plugins will be able to do all</span> <span data-start="404.169" data-end="405.459">kinds of things right now we've got a</span> <span data-start="405.459" data-end="406.93">handful of different kinds of things but</span> <span data-start="406.93" data-end="413.11">that will grow so one example of using</span> <span data-start="413.11" data-end="415.12">the plug-in system basically is</span> <span data-start="415.12" data-end="416.889">basically as we've got a little command</span> <span data-start="416.889" data-end="418.959">line best friend has a command line I'll</span> <span data-start="418.959" data-end="420.459">get into that a little bit so you type</span> <span data-start="420.459" data-end="422.289">hello and it says hi there and this is</span> <span data-start="422.289" data-end="424.029">the plugin that's doing that so I'm</span> <span data-start="424.029" data-end="425.499">changing the code in best been right</span> <span data-start="425.499" data-end="426.969">here so best ones actually great</span> <span data-start="426.969" data-end="428.74">environment for editing vestment plugins</span> <span data-start="428.74" data-end="430.33">because you can say plug-in reload hello</span> <span data-start="430.33" data-end="432.729">run the command again and then it gets</span> <span data-start="432.729" data-end="434.409">the the change text so it automatically</span> <span data-start="434.409" data-end="436.479">will dynamically reload plugins so you</span> <span data-start="436.479" data-end="438.039">can do a plug-in install and it'll just</span> <span data-start="438.039" data-end="439.479">install a plug-in while you're working</span> <span data-start="439.479"

<p><span data-start="723.08" data-end="726.59">Patrick so I'll just be talking about</span> <span data-start="726.59" data-end="728.66">some of the internals of best bin this</span> <span data-start="728.66" data-end="730.1">is not going to be extremely technical</span> <span data-start="730.1" data-end="732.35">but it's just to kind of piqued your</span> <span data-start="732.35" data-end="743.13">interest so as Kevin mentions</span> <span data-start="743.14" data-end="746.71">no that wasn't what I wanted it to do</span> <span data-start="746.71" data-end="750.44">that is

that</span> <span data-start="768.14" data-end="769.49">that we have lots and lots of plugins</span> <span data-start="769.49" data-end="772.61">and as kevin was saying the entire</span> <span data-start="772.61" data-end="775.49">editor is based around plugins and here</span> <span data-start="775.49" data-end="777.11">are some of the here are some of the</span> <span data-start="777.11" data-end="779.27">ones that we support so these are bunch</span> <span data-start="779.27" data-end="781.49">plugins that come with it and they're</span> <span data-start="781.49" data-end="783.71">even more that are in the labs</span> <span data-start="783.71" data-end="789.44">experimental sort of category and the</span> <span data-start="789.44" data-end="791.21">the cool thing about this is that not</span> <span data-start="791.21" data-end="792.77">only can you write your own plugins so</span> <span data-start="792.77" data-end="794.51">you know if you really don't like our</span> <span data-start="794.51" data-end="797.84">theme and you want a different one or if</span> <span data-start="797.84" data-end="801.98">you want to not if you don't want to use</span> <span data-start="801.98" data-end="804.5">the standard syntax and you want to say</span> <span data-start="804.5" data-end="806.51">load textmate bundles for the syntax</span> <span data-start="806.51" data-end="808.69">highlighting then you could do that too</span> <span data-start="808.69" data-end="811.58">so so you can swap these out but they're</span> <span data-start="811.58" data-end="813.47">also totally reloadable while the editor</span> <span data-start="813.47" data-end="816.14">is running so you can you can hack on</span> <span data-start="816.14" data-end="818.39">your plugin and then reload and even if</span> <span data-start="818.39" data-end="819.62">it's one of these core ones it'll just</span> <span data-start="819.62" data-end="821.75">reload the appropriate parts we have I</span> <span data-start="821.75" data-end="824.56">have some things where I've been editing</span> <span data-start="824.56" data-end="827.93">the overall app controller and it'll</span> <span data-start="827.93" data-end="829.58">just reload the whole thing so it reload</span> <span data-start="829.58" data-end="831.77">so it's pretty smart about reloading</span> <span data-start="831.77" data-end="836.39">things so this is how the text editor</span> <span data-start="836.39" data-end="838.58">itself works this is a really familiar</span> <span data-start="838.58" data-end="840.23">diagram if you've ever done any UI</span> <span data-start="840.23" data-end="842.96">programming at all it's all MVC and it's</span> <span data-start="842.96" data-end="844.67">especially familiar to you if you've</span> <span data-start="844.67" data-end="846.71">done cocoa programming so this is</span> <span data-start="846.71" data-end="848.81">actually pretty much exactly how Coco's</span> <span data-start="848.81" data-end="852.74">text API works which I we thought was a</span> <span data-start="852.74" data-end="855.14">pretty good model because first of all</span> <span data-start="855.14" data-end="856.7">it's like the poster child for MVC and</span> <span data-start="856.7" data-end="859.04">second of all it's been around since the</span> <span data-start="859.04" data-end="861.38">80s and hasn't changed much and so</span> <span data-start="861.38" data-end="862.7">obviously it's it's doing something</span> <span data-start="862.7" data-end="866.78">right and so i'll just go briefly into</span> <span data-start="866.78" data-end="869.03">all these into each of these big parts</span> <span data-start="869.03" data-end="872.51">so the text storage to make the editor</span> <span data-start="872.51" data-end="874.47">as flexible as possible</span> <span data-start="874.47" data-end="877.23">the model that it displays is actually</span> <span data-start="877.23" data-end="879.03">as close to a mutable string as you can</span> <span data-start="879.03" data-end="880.32">get in JavaScript so it's an array of</span> <span data-start="880.32" data-end="884.52">lines and when every ends so you can</span> <span data-start="884.52" data-end="885.99">basically take an editor and hook it up</span> <span data-start="885.99" data-end="888.21">to anything you want as long as it</span> <span data-start="888.21" data-end="890.25">follows this this really simple protocol</span> <span data-start="890.25" data-end="892.8">and then you can just go in and change</span> <span data-start="892.8" data-end="894.3">any of these lines it'll just show up in</span> <span data-start="894.3" data-end="895.86">the editor and it can be read only or</span> <span data-start="895.86" data-end="897.69">read right so the idea is you can use</span> <span data-start="897.69" data-end="900.48">the editor for not just text editing but</span> <span data-start="900.48" data-end="903.24">also text viewing you know code code</span> <span data-start="903.24" data-end="905.46">review tools all sorts of other things</span> <span data-start="905.46" data-end="908.91">can be used because well because it's</span> <span data-start="908.91" data-end="911.16">pretty decoupled from from the actual</span> <span data-start="911.16" data-end="913.5">storage on the file system it also lets</span> <span data-start="913.5" data-end="915.72">you do different storage api's you could</span> <span data-start="915.72" data-end="917.52">store in memory you could store on the</span> <span data-start="917.52"
