data-end="9.09">to do a quick overview of authentication</span> <span data-start="9.09" data-end="11.66">and happy and what it takes to</span> <span data-start="11.66" data-end="14.57">authenticate users and protect your</span> <span data-start="14.57" data-end="18.69">resources so first slides will be</span> <span data-start="18.69" data-end="22.47">available on my github page and i also</span> <span data-start="22.47" data-end="25.289">have examples of the happy jas supported</span> <span data-start="25.289" data-end="27.539">plugins that are available in that</span> <span data-start="27.539" data-end="32.189">repository with authentication and happy</span> <span data-start="32.189" data-end="35.07">it starts with an object that every</span> <span data-start="35.07" data-end="37.649">server has that objects going to have to</span> <span data-start="37.649" data-end="40.29">registration methods ones for schemes</span> <span data-start="40.29" data-end="43.53">ones for strategies there's a method for</span> <span data-start="43.53" data-end="46.829">testing your strategy against the</span> <span data-start="46.829" data-end="49.5">request and then there is a method for</span> <span data-start="49.5" data-end="53.16">setting a default strategy first couple</span> <span data-start="53.16" data-end="56.85">points about schemes it's just a plan to</span> <span data-start="56.85" data-end="59.48">determine how a user is authenticated um</span> <span data-start="59.48" data-end="62.16">are you looking for specific headers are</span> <span data-start="62.16" data-end="65.309">you looking for a cookie or some other</span> <span data-start="65.309" data-end="68.46">way when you write a scheme it's going</span> <span data-start="68.46" data-end="72.42">to make a call to server off scheme but</span> <span data-start="72.42" data-end="74.31">most of us aren't going to have to worry</span> <span data-start="74.31" data-end="76.38">about that because there are plenty of</span> <span data-start="76.38" data-end="79.7">plugins that do this happy Jas has for</span> <span data-start="79.7" data-end="82.47">specific types of schemes that it</span> <span data-start="82.47" data-end="83.97">supports there's a basic authentication</span> <span data-start="83.97" data-end="87.84">which is just HTTP basic authentication</span> <span data-start="87.84" data-end="91.229">there's a an RFC out there with some</span> <span data-start="91.229" data-end="93.27">specific headers that you're going to</span> <span data-start="93.27" data-end="95.07">pass back and forth that are going to</span> <span data-start="95.07" data-end="96.18">determine whether the user is</span> <span data-start="96.18" data-end="98.64">authenticated I'll be stepping through</span> <span data-start="98.64" data-end="101.1">at the end of this presentation of some</span> <span data-start="101.1" data-end="102.75">specific examples of how to actually</span> <span data-start="102.75" data-end="106.979">implement these plugins happy off cookie</span> <span data-start="106.979" data-end="111.96">is a the plug-in which will use a cookie</span> <span data-start="111.96" data-end="114.049">to determine whether a user is</span> <span data-start="114.049" data-end="116.67">authenticated just the presence of that</span> <span data-start="116.67" data-end="119.939">cookie and it being valid will determine</span> <span data-start="119.939" data-end="122.93">if that user is authenticated bail is a</span> <span data-start="122.93" data-end="125.67">plug-in for third-party authentication</span> <span data-start="125.67" data-end="129.179">so if you want to use OAuth and you want</span> <span data-start="129.179" data-end="131.25">to have password list authentication let</span> <span data-start="131.25" data-end="133.569">users log in with Facebook Twitter</span> <span data-start="133.569" data-end="137.019">github and such and then happy off hawk</span> <span data-start="137.019" data-end="140.59">is a plug-in which allows you to specify</span> <span data-start="140.59" data-end="143.519">an authorization header and it's</span> <span data-start="143.519" data-end="146.95">probably more designed for different</span> <span data-start="146.95" data-end="148.84">applications to authenticate with one</span> <span data-start="148.84" data-end="150.879">another not necessarily authenticating</span> <span data-start="150.879" data-end="153.969">specific users hopefully we'll have</span> <span data-start="153.969" data-end="155.319">enough time to get through all the</span> <span data-start="155.319" data-end="157.689">different examples but with schemes it's</span> <span data-start="157.689" data-end="159.28">already been done for you you're going</span> <span data-start="159.28" data-end="161.889">to spend most of your time configuring</span> <span data-start="161.889" data-end="166.599">an authentication strategy so when you</span> <span data-start="166.599" data-end="167.969">are configuring that authentication</span> <span data-start="167.969" data-end="171.06">strategy you're going to give it a name</span> <span data-start="171.06" data-end="173.829">you're going to reference the scheme</span> <span data-start="173.829" data-end="177.79">that you're using you're going to be</span> <span data-start="177.79" data-end="179.949">able to specify a mode it's not required</span> <span data-start="179.949" data-end="183.01">you have a couple options there the</span> <span data-start="183.01" data-end="188.56">default is true you can set it to false</span> <span data-start="188.56" data-end="191.829">which will be equivalent to optional and</span> <span data-start="191.829" data-end="193.569">try I'm not sure if that's the case</span> <span data-start="193.569" data-end="196.269">actually I'm sorry but true and required</span> <span data-start="196.269" data-end="198.849">are the same optional and try are the</span> <span data-start="198.849" data-end="202.93">same with optional and try you don't</span> <span data-start="202.93" data-end="205.54">have to be authenticated in order for</span> <span data-start="205.54" data-end="209.379">your handler to reply you could do that</span> <span data-start="209.379" data-end="212.769">on your landing page if you want to have</span> <span data-start="212.769" data-end="216.299">mixed content and then each</span> <span data-start="216.299" data-end="218.049">authentication scheme is going to have</span> <span data-start="218.049" data-end="219.879">some very specific options that you</span> <span data-start="219.879" data-end="222.25">would specify when you're creating the</span> <span data-start="222.25" data-end="226.629">strategy with the different plugins they</span> <span data-start="226.629" data-end="229.269">each have their own name which are all</span> <span data-start="229.269" data-end="232.329">pretty straightforward with hawk it</span> <span data-start="232.329" data-end="234.819">actually registers two different schemes</span> <span data-start="234.819" data-end="238.18">depending on which flavor of</span> <span data-start="238.18" data-end="242.4">authentication you want to roll out so</span> <span data-start="242.4" data-end="245.65">after you have chosen an authentication</span> <span data-start="245.65" data-end="247.719">scheme after you've specified the</span> <span data-start="247.719" data-end="249.489">strategy that you want to use you're</span> <span data-start="249.489" data-end="250.599">going to want to have to secure your</span> <span data-start="250.599" data-end="253.09">routes you'll be spending a considerable</span> <span data-start="253.09" data-end="255.849">amount of time doing this so we're just</span> <span data-start="255.849" data-end="256.989">going to step through some of the</span> <span data-start="256.989" data-end="259.509">different ways that you can add the</span> <span data-start="259.509" data-end="264.25">authentication to your route this is the</span> <span data-start="264.25" data-end="267.13">basic idea in your config option</span> <span data-start="267.13" data-end="268.84">specify the name of your strategy and</span> <span data-start="268.84" data-end="271.96">that's you know the long and the short</span> <span data-start="271.96" data-end="275.2">of it not much more to talk about but</span> <span data-start="275.2" data-end="278.47">you do have the option to specify a</span> <span data-start="278.47" data-end="281.83">default strategy instead of going</span> <span data-start="281.83" data-end="283.95">through each individual route and</span> <span data-start="283.95" data-end="286.18">securing it so if you specify the</span> <span data-start="286.18" data-end="288.07">default strategy now all of your routes</span> <span data-start="288.07" data-end="291.21">are going to be using that strategy</span> <span data-start="291.21" data-end="294.46">however you may want to override some of</span> <span data-start="294.46" data-end="296.83">those settings or actually excuse me the</span> <span data-start="296.83" data-end="299.92">default strategy can actually take on a</span> <span data-start="299.92" data-end="304.03">couple different options but you may</span> <span data-start="304.03" data-end="306.01">want to override that so if you specify</span> <span data-start="306.01" data-end="307.87">the default you can go into individual</span> <span data-start="307.87" data-end="309.91">routes and you can turn off</span> <span data-start="309.91" data-end="312.52">authentication if you set off the false</span> <span data-start="312.52" data-end="315.12">you could change the mode or any other</span> <span data-start="315.12" data-end="321.31">configurable setting so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="321.31" data-end="326.05">much it actually implementing it like I</span> <span data-start="326.05" data-end="328.03">said these examples are all available in</span> <span data-start="328.03" data-end="330.81">this repository but implementing it is</span> <span data-start="330.81" data-end="333.84">not too much work you're going to load</span> <span data-start="333.84" data-end="336.13">the plug-in that you're going to want to</span> <span data-start="336.13" data-end="341.68">use as long as well with happy Oh with</span> <span data-start="341.68" data-end="346.09">basic auth you need to have some place</span> <span data-start="346.09" data-end="347.11">where you're snoring username and</span> <span data-start="347.11" data-end="351.63">passwords and then you're going to</span> <span data-start="351.63" data-end="355.09">create a function which will compare the</span> <span data-start="355.09" data-end="356.68">username and passwords with database</span> <span data-start="356.68" data-end="358.72">you're going to receive from the request</span> <span data-start="358.72" data-end="361.72">a username and a password and then</span> <span data-start="361.72" data-end="363.87">you're going to compare them and</span> <span data-start="363.87" data-end="366.82">determine whether that user is valid if</span> <span data-start="366.82" data-end="370.99">the user is valid let me just step</span> <span data-start="370.99" data-end="372.55">through this real quick so the</span> <span data-start="372.55" data-end="374.86">validation function takes a username and</span> <span data-start="374.86" data-end="376.69">a password and a call back in the</span> <span data-start="376.69" data-end="380.65">signature and you compare the user and</span> <span data-start="380.65" data-end="382.54">the password determine if it's valid and</span> <span data-start="382.54" data-end="386.1">then you specify a object known as</span> <span data-start="386.1" data-end="388.36">credentials which will be available</span> <span data-start="388.36" data-end="392.02">later on in your request through request</span> <span data-start="392.02" data-end="394.36">off that credential you can store any</span> <span data-start="394.36" data-end="395.7">information you want in there in this</span> <span data-start="395.7" data-end="399.25">example we just store the name then you</span> <span data-start="399.25" data-end="400.71">call the callback with an error</span> <span data-start="400.71" data-end="403.99">you specify whether the user is or is</span> <span data-start="403.99" data-end="406.54">not valid and you pass along the</span> <span data-start="406.54" data-end="412.21">credentials object um when you're</span> <span data-start="412.21" data-end="413.35">setting up your server you're going to</span> <span data-start="413.35" data-end="415.24">specify your different handlers you'll</span> <span data-start="415.24" data-end="416.47">have a public handle or you'll have</span> <span data-start="416.47" data-end="418.99">private handlers or whatever it is that</span> <span data-start="418.99" data-end="422.31">you happen to have in your application</span> <span data-start="422.31" data-end="425.76">create a server you register the plug-in</span> <span data-start="425.76" data-end="430">and you specify your off Val your auth</span> <span data-start="430" data-end="434.56">options for basic auth it's just the</span> <span data-start="434.56" data-end="437.92">validation function and with that</span> <span data-start="437.92" data-end="443.34">particular object validation function</span> <span data-start="443.34" data-end="445.84">then you call server da thought strategy</span> <span data-start="445.84" data-end="448.3">give your strategy a name specify the</span> <span data-start="448.3" data-end="452.62">scheme and the auth options then within</span> <span data-start="452.62" data-end="454.93">your routes you have your public route</span> <span data-start="454.93" data-end="456.55">which doesn't specify any authentication</span> <span data-start="456.55" data-end="458.74">you have your private route which you do</span> <span data-start="458.74" data-end="463.45">specify basic off um and that's it if</span> <span data-start="463.45" data-end="465.85">you were to go to the private page your</span> <span data-start="465.85" data-end="468.1">browser's going to prompt you for</span> <span data-start="468.1" data-end="470.23">username and password all browsers</span> <span data-start="470.23" data-end="474.73">support basic authentication with cookie</span> <span data-start="474.73" data-end="478.96">off a couple things change in this as I</span> <span data-start="478.96" data-end="480.43">step through this this is just going to</span> <span data-start="480.43" data-end="483.01">be highlighting the differences to get</span> <span data-start="483.01" data-end="488.53">from basic off to cookie off um we're</span> <span data-start="488.53" data-end="490.54">going to load the off cookie plugin</span> <span data-start="490.54" data-end="492.22">we're going to load joy as well because</span> <span data-start="492.22" data-end="493.93">we're going to actually have to accept</span> <span data-start="493.93" data-end="495.64">the username and the password through a</span> <span data-start="495.64" data-end="502.36">request so the validation function that</span> <span data-start="502.36" data-end="504.49">we use previously now becomes a handler</span> <span data-start="504.49" data-end="508.24">and the username in the password will be</span> <span data-start="508.24" data-end="511.21">found in the payload will step through</span> <span data-start="511.21" data-end="513.43">and compare the username and password</span> <span data-start="513.43" data-end="517">the same way we did previously if the</span> <span data-start="517" data-end="518.26">user is not valid we're going to</span> <span data-start="518.26" data-end="522.49">redirect them to the login page and if</span> <span data-start="522.49" data-end="524.32">they are valid we're going to get past</span> <span data-start="524.32" data-end="526.45">that point we'll set the credentials and</span> <span data-start="526.45" data-end="529.06">then we're going to set a session the</span> <span data-start="529.06" data-end="530.92">cookie that gets stored on the user</span> <span data-start="530.92" data-end="533.54">system will contain</span> <span data-start="533.54" data-end="536.389">everything that's within that object</span> <span data-start="536.389"

data-end="576.92">session clear so now once we've started</span> <span data-start="576.92" data-end="578.569">up our server or excuse me once we've</span> <span data-start="578.569" data-end="579.769">created our server we're going to</span> <span data-start="579.769" data-end="582.649">register the off plug in the auth cookie</span> <span data-start="582.649" data-end="584.269">plugin and then we're going to specify</span> <span data-start="584.269" data-end="587.269">the different options for cookie off</span> <span data-start="587.269"
