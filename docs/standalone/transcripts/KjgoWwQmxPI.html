data-end="574.29">you don't belong there or that you can</span> <span data-start="574.29" data-end="575.67">never learn there would be as good as</span> <span data-start="575.67"

data-end="581.069">because if you're if you're too afraid</span> <span data-start="581.069" data-end="583.41">of actually trying something and failing</span> <span data-start="583.41" data-end="585.449">well you're not gonna learn because the</span> <span data-start="585.449" data-end="587.16">main way that we learn things is by</span> <span data-start="587.16" data-end="589.44">doing is white practice actually there's</span> <span data-start="589.44" data-end="591.779">a pretty cool paper about the psychology</span> <span data-start="591.779" data-end="593.91">of learning that says that well</span> <span data-start="593.91" data-end="596.699">basically 80% of learning is just doing</span> <span data-start="596.699" data-end="599.399">by practice training four senses like</span> <span data-start="599.399" data-end="602.579">the actual lectures but fundamentally</span> <span data-start="602.579" data-end="604.829">you just learn something by trying it</span> <span data-start="604.829" data-end="606.54">and you're probably gonna fail I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="606.54" data-end="607.769">if you don't know something and</span> <span data-start="607.769" data-end="609.6">something is like completely new to you</span> <span data-start="609.6" data-end="612.089">then odds are you're you're not gonna be</span> <span data-start="612.089" data-end="613.889">great at first or you're gonna fail at</span> <span data-start="613.889" data-end="616.05">something so that's that's really a</span> <span data-start="616.05" data-end="617.76">shame that we don't have these kind of</span> <span data-start="617.76" data-end="620.43">things well you're also not gonna evolve</span> <span data-start="620.43" data-end="622.23">you're not you're not gonna grow because</span> <span data-start="622.23" data-end="624.54">if you're sag nating at a place and</span> <span data-start="624.54" data-end="626.49">you're kind of like afraid to take the</span> <span data-start="626.49" data-end="628.8">extra step because what if I'm not</span> <span data-start="628.8" data-end="630.72">good what if I can never get there what</span> <span data-start="630.72" data-end="633.269">if I try and I fail in front of everyone</span> <span data-start="633.269" data-end="635.01">and what are people gonna say well then</span> <span data-start="635.01" data-end="637.769">you're not gonna grow I'm sorry it's</span> <span data-start="637.769" data-end="640.139">just not gonna happen most importantly</span> <span data-start="640.139" data-end="642.389">and I think it's a very contradictory</span> <span data-start="642.389" data-end="644.61">thing since it's such a buzzword and</span> <span data-start="644.61" data-end="647.6">companies and tech conferences nowadays</span> <span data-start="647.6" data-end="650.31">you have no innovation which is</span> <span data-start="650.31"

data-end="657.329">team and blah blah blah we do machine</span> <span data-start="657.329" data-end="661.47">learning well the way they learn</span> <span data-start="661.47" data-end="663.64">machine learning is by trying and</span> <span data-start="663.64" data-end="665.65">faily and honestly I I can say by</span> <span data-start="665.65" data-end="667.87">experience because I try I do</span> <span data-start="667.87" data-end="669.4">machine-gunner myself because I think</span> <span data-start="669.4" data-end="671.86">it's super cool and interesting and it</span> <span data-start="671.86" data-end="674.2">is a really really frustrating thing to</span> <span data-start="674.2" data-end="677.38">to learn because there's so many things</span> <span data-start="677.38" data-end="679.45">that you don't get straight out of the</span> <span data-start="679.45" data-end="681.76">box because it is a very like academic</span> <span data-start="681.76" data-end="684.76">and theory heavy thing so it is very</span> <span data-start="684.76" data-end="687.58">taxing and if you're afraid of like</span> <span data-start="687.58" data-end="690.22">maybe not making it or not understanding</span> <span data-start="690.22" data-end="692.89">machine learning well you're not gonna</span> <span data-start="692.89" data-end="694.81">know machine learning so these are</span> <span data-start="694.81" data-end="697.18">pretty important three things that we</span> <span data-start="697.18" data-end="699.49">will be missing out if we are just too</span> <span data-start="699.49" data-end="703.87">afraid to fail and which was failure was</span> <span data-start="703.87" data-end="705.55">one of the things that will happen to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="705.55" data-end="707.95">Bill Gates not sure if you guys know but</span> <span data-start="707.95" data-end="710.74">before Microsoft he had another company</span> <span data-start="710.74" data-end="712.98">called travel data if I'm not mistaken</span> <span data-start="712.98" data-end="715.42">the whole gist of the company is that</span> <span data-start="715.42" data-end="717.64">they they would like collect traffic</span> <span data-start="717.64" data-end="719.86">data from local authorities to try and</span> <span data-start="719.86" data-end="721.57">predict how the traffic was gonna be</span> <span data-start="721.57" data-end="723.7">that was like especially important for</span> <span data-start="723.7" data-end="726.37">trucks and and frights things and</span> <span data-start="726.37" data-end="728.2">shipments and that that was pretty cool</span> <span data-start="728.2" data-end="730.42">idea but it turns out it didn't really</span> <span data-start="730.42" data-end="733.39">work but there's actually this thing at</span> <span data-start="733.39" data-end="737.05">a at a computer museum or something and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="737.05" data-end="739.81">I found the text in this little plaque</span> <span data-start="739.81" data-end="742.06">here pretty interesting this is Paul</span> <span data-start="742.06" data-end="744.88">Allen Bill Gates a partner said that</span> <span data-start="744.88" data-end="747.85">well basically travel data wasn't a huge</span> <span data-start="747.85" data-end="751.42">success but it was essential for them to</span> <span data-start="751.42" data-end="753.55">actually be able to have Microsoft and</span> <span data-start="753.55" data-end="755.62">for Microsoft to be as successful as it</span> <span data-start="755.62" data-end="757.96">is it wouldn't have happened if they</span> <span data-start="757.96" data-end="759.76">hadn't failed first at something else</span> <span data-start="759.76" data-end="761.83">and tried something again they really</span> <span data-start="761.83" data-end="763.6">learned from it so that's that's how</span> <span data-start="763.6" data-end="767.29">Microsoft was built so there's a few</span> <span data-start="767.29" data-end="770.02">perks in when failing failing horribly</span> <span data-start="770.02" data-end="772.81">at life the first one is that it</span> <span data-start="772.81" data-end="774.94">improves confidence after you try</span> <span data-start="774.94" data-end="778.27">something you fail and you realize that</span> <span data-start="778.27" data-end="780.28">well you know what I survived</span> <span data-start="780.28" data-end="782.71">that's awesome I can try this again or I</span> <span data-start="782.71" data-end="784.48">can try different things so it really</span> <span data-start="784.48" data-end="786.82">makes a few more confidence at your own</span> <span data-start="786.82" data-end="788.47">ability to solve problems your own</span> <span data-start="788.47" data-end="791.59">ability to recover crisis your own</span> <span data-start="791.59" data-end="794.62">ability to manage and unpredictable</span> <span data-start="794.62" data-end="796.96">things so it is really</span> <span data-start="796.96" data-end="799.029">good to just get yourself out there and</span> <span data-start="799.029" data-end="801.07">try things for the first time because it</span> <span data-start="801.07" data-end="803.17">gets you more used to this way of</span> <span data-start="803.17" data-end="805.36">thinking because honestly ultimately it</span> <span data-start="805.36" data-end="808.72">is a way of thinking second thing is</span> <span data-start="808.72" data-end="811.39">that it just gives you tons of new</span> <span data-start="811.39" data-end="813.61">things that you learned about like well</span> <span data-start="813.61" data-end="815.26">when you tried something for the first</span> <span data-start="815.26" data-end="817.209">time that didn't happen so oh yeah I</span> <span data-start="817.209" data-end="818.8">learned that next time I'm gonna do it</span> <span data-start="818.8" data-end="820.959">differently so most of these things that</span> <span data-start="820.959" data-end="822.91">we learn about programming you're about</span> <span data-start="822.91" data-end="824.98">teching about talking and dealing to</span> <span data-start="824.98" data-end="827.56">people you usually just get it you</span> <span data-start="827.56" data-end="829.69">understand that by trying something and</span> <span data-start="829.69" data-end="831.58">and realizing what's the outcome and</span> <span data-start="831.58" data-end="833.74">most times the outcome is not gonna be</span> <span data-start="833.74" data-end="835.72">great but that's fine that's part of</span> <span data-start="835.72" data-end="838.42">life so it does teach you a lot I would</span> <span data-start="838.42" data-end="841.33">say like it's it's you just learn so</span> <span data-start="841.33" data-end="844.06">much more from horribly of failure</span> <span data-start="844.06" data-end="846.22">experiences than these successes because</span> <span data-start="846.22" data-end="848.29">those are the experiences where as</span> <span data-start="848.29" data-end="850.24">something unpredictable happens and you</span> <span data-start="850.24" data-end="852.279">deal with it and they teach you so much</span> <span data-start="852.279" data-end="855.149">more than just like the success outcome</span> <span data-start="855.149" data-end="857.529">it could lead to happy accidents</span> <span data-start="857.529" data-end="860.08">sometimes we do have a plan in mind and</span> <span data-start="860.08" data-end="862.69">and honestly the thing that we haven't</span> <span data-start="862.69" data-end="865.36">envisioned doesn't really happen but you</span> <span data-start="865.36" data-end="867.07">just end up in really interesting</span> <span data-start="867.07" data-end="868.72">scenarios that perhaps you didn't even</span> <span data-start="868.72" data-end="871.42">know about them it's it's not related to</span> <span data-start="871.42" data-end="873.55">tech but it is a pretty interesting</span> <span data-start="873.55" data-end="875.32">story that that was actually the case of</span> <span data-start="875.32" data-end="878.02">penicillin so basically I forgot his</span> <span data-start="878.02" data-end="879.97">name but the guy that was like making a</span> <span data-start="879.97" data-end="883.15">study on penicillin forgot to basically</span> <span data-start="883.15" data-end="886.95">put a lid on the on the bottle thingy</span> <span data-start="886.95" data-end="890.17">and then mold started to appear and he</span> <span data-start="890.17" data-end="892.27">was like really ready to throw away the</span> <span data-start="892.27" data-end="895.66">whole thing when he actually he realized</span> <span data-start="895.66" data-end="897.61">that the the penicillin was killing the</span> <span data-start="897.61" data-end="900.79">mode the mold so that was a pretty cool</span> <span data-start="900.79" data-end="902.44">thing and perhaps he wouldn't have</span> <span data-start="902.44" data-end="904.6">reached that conclusion that this was</span> <span data-start="904.6" data-end="906.01">actually something that was worth</span> <span data-start="906.01" data-end="908.92">looking into if he didn't have that</span> <span data-start="908.92" data-end="911.2">accident that well you can look at it</span> <span data-start="911.2" data-end="913">and see okay that was a mistake but</span> <span data-start="913" data-end="914.89">actually that led to a pretty cool and</span> <span data-start="914.89" data-end="917.89">interesting solution and the last one is</span> <span data-start="917.89" data-end="920.8">that like for the future events and for</span> <span data-start="920.8" data-end="922.75">the future opportunities you're gonna be</span> <span data-start="922.75" data-end="925.029">able to recover so much faster from</span> <span data-start="925.029" data-end="927.82">mistakes because I think it's really</span> <span data-start="927.82" data-end="930.07">unrealistic to try and</span> <span data-start="930.07" data-end="931.78">set a goal to yourself was like oh you</span> <span data-start="931.78" data-end="933.31">know what I'm gonna try that I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="933.31" data-end="934.36">be perfect</span> <span data-start="934.36" data-end="937.42">sorry you're not but it's a much more</span> <span data-start="937.42" data-end="939.46">realistic goal to just say okay I'm</span> <span data-start="939.46" data-end="941.2">gonna try this and I'm gonna be brave</span> <span data-start="941.2" data-end="943.36">enough to just see what it how it goes</span> <span data-start="943.36" data-end="946.33">and see how I can deal with this and</span> <span data-start="946.33" data-end="949.15">honestly if you have like failed a</span> <span data-start="949.15" data-end="951.19">couple of times at the same thing you're</span> <span data-start="951.19" data-end="952.93">just able to recognize like your own</span> <span data-start="952.93" data-end="955.24">patterns of thinking your own ways of</span> <span data-start="955.24" data-end="957.64">like okay how does that mistake make me</span> <span data-start="957.64" data-end="959.83">feel like okay I get really anxious when</span> <span data-start="959.83" data-end="962.14">this happens so perhaps the next
