<p><span data-start="37.98" data-end="41.44">alright thanks for coming to this talk</span> <span data-start="41.44" data-end="44.44">it seems to be my luck that at</span> <span data-start="44.44" data-end="46.63">conferences I'm often up against people</span> <span data-start="46.63" data-end="49.36">i admire at the same time in the other</span> <span data-start="49.36" data-end="51.07">room and that is the case here you</span> <span data-start="51.07" data-end="52.87">should definitely check out James long's</span> <span data-start="52.87" data-end="55.78">works on ensuite je s macros for</span> <span data-start="55.78" data-end="57.79">JavaScript since we came to this talk</span> <span data-start="57.79" data-end="60.399">and you're missing that but since you</span> <span data-start="60.399" data-end="62.5">did come to this talk I think you're in</span> <span data-start="62.5" data-end="65.979">for a treat I'm going to talk about a</span> <span data-start="65.979" data-end="68.68">project called regenerator which is an</span> <span data-start="68.68" data-end="70.75">effort to take one of the really cool I</span> <span data-start="70.75" data-end="73.42">think the coolest feature of the next</span> <span data-start="73.42" data-end="75.76">version of JavaScript acma script 6 and</span> <span data-start="75.76" data-end="79.659">simulate it using javascript of today so</span> <span data-start="79.659" data-end="80.979">you can go ahead and use that feature</span> <span data-start="80.979" data-end="84.46">from the future in the present or in a</span> <span data-start="84.46" data-end="87.76">browser more to the point i'm ben newman</span> <span data-start="87.76" data-end="90.909">and i work at facebook a release</span> <span data-start="90.909" data-end="94.42">regenerator with my my team at facebook</span> <span data-start="94.42" data-end="96.25">which is the javascript infrastructure</span> <span data-start="96.25" data-end="97.99">team and we have been maintaining it</span> <span data-start="97.99" data-end="100.15">actively so it's not just thrown over</span> <span data-start="100.15" data-end="102.01">the wall if you want to talk to me</span> <span data-start="102.01" data-end="104.65">specifically in following up on any of</span> <span data-start="104.65" data-end="106.24">this stuff or just get to know me i'm</span> <span data-start="106.24" data-end="109.27">benjamin without the eye on most forms</span> <span data-start="109.27" data-end="114.64">of social media as you can see there so</span> <span data-start="114.64" data-end="118.54">when we released regenerator wrote up</span> <span data-start="118.54" data-end="121.09">this sort of call to action page and</span> <span data-start="121.09" data-end="124.39">posted it up on hacker news and got into</span> <span data-start="124.39" data-end="126.43">like the top five and the the comments</span> <span data-start="126.43" data-end="130.169">were all really surprisingly</span> <span data-start="130.169" data-end="132.159">appreciative there was very little</span> <span data-start="132.159" data-end="135.01">backlash and one of the things I think</span> <span data-start="135.01" data-end="137.92">went well about this launch is that it's</span> <span data-start="137.92" data-end="140.26">it signals just from a headline like</span> <span data-start="140.26" data-end="143.26">this that you might need to have or want</span> <span data-start="143.26" data-end="146.14">to have a little bit of context a little</span> <span data-start="146.14" data-end="148.03">bit of experience with the idea of</span> <span data-start="148.03" data-end="151.269">generator functions before you have an</span> <span data-start="151.269" data-end="153.7">opinion about you know the way we did it</span> <span data-start="153.7" data-end="157">was correct or the best way of doing it</span> <span data-start="157" data-end="161.53">and so I I live in New York and one of</span> <span data-start="161.53" data-end="164.409">our local meetups is Brooklyn j/s at the</span> <span data-start="164.409" data-end="166.659">last instance of Brooklyn jas Brittany</span> <span data-start="166.659" data-end="168.819">sister Rose gave a talk about technical</span> <span data-start="168.819" data-end="171.67">writing and she gave me a term that that</span> <span data-start="171.67" data-end="174.31">now sort of helps me conceptualize this</span> <span data-start="174.31" data-end="177.76">this idea so you have low context and</span> <span data-start="177.76" data-end="181.84">high context audience members and you</span> <span data-start="181.84" data-end="183.22">can write in different ways and you</span> <span data-start="183.22" data-end="186.34">should write in different ways when your</span> <span data-start="186.34" data-end="187.959">audience comes in with some context</span> <span data-start="187.959" data-end="189.639">versus when they come in with much</span> <span data-start="189.639" data-end="192.73">context and so I'm making a bet that</span> <span data-start="192.73" data-end="195.639">jayus conf and the group of people who</span> <span data-start="195.639" data-end="197.65">have come to this talk stand the best</span> <span data-start="197.65" data-end="199.629">chance of having a little bit of context</span> <span data-start="199.629" data-end="201.97">around these issues of anyone anywhere</span> <span data-start="201.97" data-end="204.519">so I hope you don't mind if I abuse you</span> <span data-start="204.519" data-end="207.069">with what I would consider to be a</span> <span data-start="207.069" data-end="208.599">pretty technical talk there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="208.599" data-end="211.69">code and I would just encourage you if</span> <span data-start="211.69" data-end="213.849">you if you want to follow along at all</span> <span data-start="213.849" data-end="216.4">look at the slides read along with the</span> <span data-start="216.4" data-end="218.319">code as I'm talking about it otherwise</span> <span data-start="218.319" data-end="221.739">if I'm just talking about it and you</span> <span data-start="221.739" data-end="223.209">know you haven't been looking you may</span> <span data-start="223.209" data-end="224.68">find yourself lost which is totally fine</span> <span data-start="224.68" data-end="226.87">i'll try to change the tone of my voice</span> <span data-start="226.87" data-end="228.069">when there's something like sort of</span> <span data-start="228.069" data-end="230.739">independently interesting and you know</span> <span data-start="230.739" data-end="234">maybe you can get back on the the path</span> <span data-start="234" data-end="239.5">but with that warning out of the way so</span> <span data-start="239.5" data-end="242.879">calls to action right are something we</span> <span data-start="242.879" data-end="246.519">often feel like issuing when we've built</span> <span data-start="246.519" data-end="248.079">something that we're proud of we think</span> <span data-start="248.079" data-end="249.819">other people should use it we think it's</span> <span data-start="249.819" data-end="252.19">a better way of doing things then the</span> <span data-start="252.19" data-end="253.359">way things have been done in the past</span> <span data-start="253.359" data-end="256.329">and we want to tell ourselves that we</span> <span data-start="256.329" data-end="257.859">and everybody else should have been</span> <span data-start="257.859" data-end="261.94">doing it this way all along and github</span> <span data-start="261.94" data-end="264.7">is indeed littered with better ways of</span> <span data-start="264.7" data-end="266.289">doing things really better ways for</span> <span data-start="266.289" data-end="268.34">someone of doing something</span> <span data-start="268.34" data-end="270.68">that never quite caught on and why is</span> <span data-start="270.68" data-end="275.6">that well I would claim that in addition</span> <span data-start="275.6" data-end="278.96">to having a bright idea about how you</span> <span data-start="278.96" data-end="280.49">ought to have done something from the</span> <span data-start="280.49" data-end="283.669">beginning you can't just go back and</span> <span data-start="283.669" data-end="285.53">start over from scratch if you could it</span> <span data-start="285.53" data-end="286.85">would be easy to do it the right way</span> <span data-start="286.85" data-end="291.32">from scratch but they're also you also</span> <span data-start="291.32" data-end="293.3">have to have a second clever idea which</span> <span data-start="293.3" data-end="295.34">is how to get from where you are right</span> <span data-start="295.34" data-end="297.68">now with the the application stack that</span> <span data-start="297.68" data-end="300.68">you've inherited to that new place that</span> <span data-start="300.68" data-end="303.05">is as if you started from scratch with</span> <span data-start="303.05" data-end="305.3">all the right ideas so there has to be a</span> <span data-start="305.3" data-end="307.639">way forward not just backwards and then</span> <span data-start="307.639" data-end="311.3">forwards again and I would go I would go</span> <span data-start="311.3" data-end="312.53">further to claim that programming</span> <span data-start="312.53" data-end="314.93">languages are notoriously difficult in</span> <span data-start="314.93" data-end="316.82">this way they're difficult to fix</span> <span data-start="316.82" data-end="321.229">forward so if i can ask inflammatory</span> <span data-start="321.229" data-end="322.52">question that may not be so inflammatory</span> <span data-start="322.52" data-end="324.38">here because this is a JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="324.38" data-end="328.28">not a Python conference what why is it</span> <span data-start="328.28" data-end="330.77">it's been since 2008 and Python 3 is</span> <span data-start="330.77" data-end="333.169">definitely a better language in a lot of</span> <span data-start="333.169" data-end="335.78">ways than Python 2 and Python 2 is one</span> <span data-start="335.78" data-end="336.83">of the most successful programming</span> <span data-start="336.83" data-end="338.78">language in the history of programming</span> <span data-start="338.78" data-end="342.26">languages why is it that big projects</span> <span data-start="342.26" data-end="345.53">haven't switched to python 3 Django for</span> <span data-start="345.53" data-end="351.02">instance and so I don't know how many</span> <span data-start="351.02" data-end="352.669">people have used python of any version</span> <span data-start="352.669" data-end="356.81">in the room almost everyone maybe eighty</span> <span data-start="356.81" data-end="358.37">ninety percent how many people have</span> <span data-start="358.37" data-end="361.039">written a line of Python 3 that runs in</span> <span data-start="361.039" data-end="363.59">production all right all right we can</span> <span data-start="363.59" data-end="366.77">walk away from this discussion okay so I</span> <span data-start="366.77" data-end="368.33">don't want to go into this too much but</span> </p>

about</span> <span data-start="988.019" data-end="990.959">generator functions so here's an example</span> <span data-start="990.959" data-end="994.17">of a generator function and I apologize</span> <span data-start="994.17" data-end="997.23">that it's not like Fibonacci or</span> <span data-start="997.23" data-end="999">something like that it's a little bit</span> <span data-start="999" data-end="1000.769">more sophisticated this had all of the</span> <span data-start="1000.769" data-end="1002.24">things that I wanted to talk about in it</span> <span data-start="1002.24" data-end="1004.01">so that's why I chose this function for</span> <span data-start="1004.01" data-end="1006.319">printing out the or rather yielding each</span> <span data-start="1006.319" data-end="1009.98">of the permutations of a given list so I</span> <span data-start="1009.98" data-end="1012.05">did look this out to remind myself how</span> <span data-start="1012.05" data-end="1015.829">to do this ah so the way it works is if</span> <span data-start="1015.829" data-end="1018.47">the list is just 1 or 0 elements that's</span> <span data-start="1018.47" data-end="1021.74">the only permutation of the list so you</span> <span data-start="1021.74" data-end="1024.77">yield that otherwise you take the list</span> <span data-start="1024.77" data-end="1026.54">consisting of just the first element in</span> <span data-start="1026.54" data-end="1029.059">the list and then you take all the</span> <span data-start="1029.059" data-end="1032.47">permutations of the rest of the list and</span> <span data-start="1032.47" data-end="1035.78">for each of those child permutations you</span> <span data-start="1035.78" data-end="1038.209">sort of walk the first element</span> <span data-start="1038.209" data-end="1042.47">it at each place so you you know none of</span> <span data-start="1042.47" data-end="1044.059">those permutations contain that element</span> <span data-start="1044.059" data-end="1045.98">but then you put it back in at each</span> <span data-start="1045.98" data-end="1048.559">possible place and so when you yield</span> <span data-start="1048.559" data-end="1050.33">each of those things you're yielding all</span> <span data-start="1050.33" data-end="1052.33">the possible permutations of the list</span> <span data-start="1052.33" data-end="1055.73">and here's an example of how you might</span> <span data-start="1055.73" data-end="1061.01">use it with the list 132 and get some</span> <span data-start="1061.01" data-end="1073.97">water so if you're used to generator</span> <span data-start="1073.97" data-end="1076.1">functions in Python you may not be used</span> <span data-start="1076.1" data-end="1078.5">to the next method of the generator</span> <span data-start="1078.5"

<p><span data-start="1085.309" data-end="1087.799">Agnes crypt 6 so in each of those cases</span> <span data-start="1087.799" data-end="1090.039">the value is one of the permutations and</span> <span

data-start="1185.99" data-end="1189.59">okay so here's our original function and</span> <span data-start="1189.59" data-end="1192.33">what's the first step well it's going to</span> <span data-start="1192.33" data-end="1196.23">turn out to be convenient if we take all</span> <span data-start="1196.23" data-end="1198.059">of the variable declarations from inside</span> <span

data-end="1213.6">those are just assignment statements</span> <span data-start="1213.6" data-end="1215.76">right so why do we do that why does that</span> <span data-start="1215.76" data-end="1216.78">matter that doesn't actually change</span> <span data-start="1216.78" data-end="1220.559">anything yet well then introduce a</span> <span data-start="1220.559"

data-end="1230.16">okay the reason for that t0 and t1 is</span> <span data-start="1230.16" data-end="1231.48">that we're going to turn the four of</span> <span data-start="1231.48" data-end="1233.549">loop just into a while loop so that we</span> <span data-start="1233.549" data-end="1234.87">can treat it the same way as any other</span> <span data-start="1234.87" data-end="1238.59">while loop so if you if you see 4p of PS</span> <span data-start="1238.59" data-end="1240.99">it's now going to change into this call</span> <span data-start="1240.99"

each</span> <span data-start="1251.71" data-end="1253.87">time it will assign the value to the</span> <span data-start="1253.87" data-end="1255.85">loop variable P so now we've got a plain</span> <span data-start="1255.85" data-end="1257.71">old while lib don't have to care about</span> <span data-start="1257.71" data-end="1260.83">four of loops anymore okay so still</span> <span data-start="1260.83" data-end="1262.24">haven't really changed anything still</span> <span data-start="1262.24" data-end="1264.85">have yield expressions and it's still a</span> <span data-start="1264.85" data-end="1267.61">generator but now we're going to return</span> <span data-start="1267.61" data-end="1270.669">a an anonymous generator that doesn't</span> <span

data-start="1280.929" data-end="1283.6">but we need to turn the body of this</span> <span data-start="1283.6" data-end="1285.19">function into something that can execute</span> <span data-start="1285.19" data-end="1288.61">in JavaScript of today and my idea for</span> <span data-start="1288.61" data-end="1291.58">how to do that is to have a switch</span> <span data-start="1291.58" data-end="1294.149">statement inside of a wild true loop</span> <span data-start="1294.149" data-end="1296.679">where the cases of the switch statement</span> <span data-start="1296.679" data-end="1299.73">are jump targets that we can sort of</span> <span data-start="1299.73" data-end="1302.59">jump to as if we had a go-to statement</span> <span data-start="1302.59" data-end="1304.21">in JavaScript which sounds like the</span> <span data-start="1304.21" data-end="1305.47">worst thing in the world but ends up</span> <span data-start="1305.47" data-end="1308.77">being pretty cool so the first one is</span> <span data-start="1308.77" data-end="1310.899">case zero as you might imagine and this</span> <span data-start="1310.899" data-end="1312.7">is going to test to see what the length</span> <span data-start="1312.7" data-end="1314.37">of the list is if it's less than two</span> <span data-start="1314.37" data-end="1318.159">we're going to jump to case five and we</span> <span data-start="1318.159" data-end="1320.11">do that by setting contacts next to five</span> <span data-start="1320.11" data-end="1321.64">and then breaking which you'll note</span> <span data-start="1321.64" data-end="1323.32">breaks out of the switch statement but</span> <span data-start="1323.32" data-end="1325.299">not the while loop so we loop back</span> <span data-start="1325.299" data-end="1327.22">around for another iteration context</span> <span data-start="1327.22" data-end="1333.82">next is five and then case five will</span> <span data-start="1333.82" data-end="1337.39">come later you may remember in this case</span> <span data-start="1337.39" data-end="1339.27">that we wanted to yield the list itself</span> <span data-start="1339.27" data-end="1341.98">so the way we do that is by returning</span> <span data-start="1341.98" data-end="1343.87">the list so that's the answer to what</span> <span data-start="1343.87" data-end="1345.399">happens to the yield expression it</span> <span data-start="1345.399" data-end="1348.49">becomes a return statement but we want</span> <span data-start="1348.49" data-end="1350.62">to know where to come back to after we</span> <span data-start="1350.62" data-end="1352.779">call back into the the generator next</span> <span data-start="1352.779" data-end="1354.909">function so we've set context I next two</span> <span data-start="1354.909" data-end="1356.26">three in this case which is the next</span> <span data-start="1356.26" data-end="1359.799">case and if you remember in that case</span> <span data-start="1359.799" data-end="1361.63">after we yield that one value of the</span> <span data-start="1361.63" data-end="1363.549">list we're done so we're going to jump</span> <span data-start="1363.549" data-end="1365.679">all the way to the end which happens to</span> <span data-start="1365.679" data-end="1369.13">be a case 19 as you can see over there</span> <span data-start="1369.13" data-end="1371.77">on the side which is called context stop</span> <span data-start="1371.77" data-end="1374.2">shuts everything down and freeze some</span> <span data-start="1374.2" data-end="1378.309">memory and so that's the like you know</span> <span data-start="1378.309" data-end="1382.539">abort abort case but in case the length</span> <span data-start="1382.539" data-end="1384.909">was not less than 2 then we were going</span> <span data-start="1384.909" data-end="1385.42">to jump to</span> <span data-start="1385.42" data-end="1388.72">the fifth case and here it is this is</span> <span data-start="1388.72" data-end="1392.92">where we call where we get the first</span> <span data-start="1392.92" data-end="1394.78">element as a list and then the rest of</span> <span data-start="1394.78" data-end="1397.12">the permutations and the values of those</span> <span data-start="1397.12" data-end="1399.69">that permutations object and we</span> <span

data-end="1723.269">the loop if there's a test in the for</span> <span data-start="1723.269" data-end="1724.919">statement and it doesn't have to be a</span> <span data-start="1724.919" data-end="1729.029">test then if the test is false we jump</span> <span data-start="1729.029" data-end="1731.999">to the after location and note that we</span> <span data-start="1731.999" data-end="1733.409">don't even really know where the after</span> <span data-start="1733.409" data-end="1735.84">location is yet but it's still fine to</span> <span data-start="1735.84" data-end="1737.789">plan on jumping there when we do know</span> <span data-start="1737.789" data-end="1741.149">and then because this is a loop we want</span> <span data-start="1741.149" data-end="1742.619">to keep track of what loops were inside</span> <span data-start="1742.619" data-end="1744.509">in case we come across a break or a</span> <span data-start="1744.509" data-end="1746.49">continue or return that we need to</span> <span data-start="1746.49" data-end="1748.499">interpret in that context so there's</span> <span data-start="1748.499" data-end="1753.69">this leap manager leap is my made-up</span> <span data-start="1753.69" data-end="1755.879">term for a break or continue or a yield</span> <span data-start="1755.879" data-end="1758.85">or a throw that knows how to deal with</span> <span data-start="1758.85" data-end="1761.279">those things and there's we're putting a</span> <span data-start="1761.279" data-end="1764.179">new loop entry onto that stack and then</span> <span data-start="1764.179" data-end="1768.62">exploding the the body of the loop</span> <span data-start="1768.63" data-end="1772.65">and now after the body we are going to</span> <span data-start="1772.65" data-end="1775.05">omit the code for the update part of the</span> <span data-start="1775.05" data-end="1777.42">for statement and so we need to mark</span> <span data-start="1777.42" data-end="1779.88">that so we can jump to it if there is an</span> <span data-start="1779.88" data-end="1781.11">update part I guess I might have been</span> <span data-start="1781.11" data-end="1783.45">able to avoid marking it if there wasn't</span> <span data-start="1783.45" data-end="1786.69">but I did then we generate code for that</span> <span data-start="1786.69" data-end="1790.26">and we met some code that jumps back to</span> <span data-start="1790.26" data-end="1792.36">the head of the loop so we're going to</span> <span data-start="1792.36" data-end="1795.36">go right back to the test part and then</span> <span data-start="1795.36" data-end="1798.03">mark the after part and so now we've</span> <span data-start="1798.03" data-end="1799.53">marked all of our locations they have</span> <span data-start="1799.53" data-end="1803.57">actual numeric values and can be used in</span> <span data-start="1803.57" data-end="1806.76">the code that generated and now we're</span> <span data-start="1806.76" data-end="1809.37">done so we break out of this case we've</span> <span data-start="1809.37" data-end="1812.1">successfully emitted code for a for</span> <span data-start="1812.1" data-end="1818.25">statement so how does look work it's</span> <span data-start="1818.25" data-end="1819.96">actually dead simple simplest thing in</span> <span data-start="1819.96" data-end="1823.47">the talk it returns a literal abstract</span> <span data-start="1823.47" data-end="1826.32">syntax tree node object initialized to</span> <span data-start="1826.32" data-end="1828.21">negative one just as a sentinel for this</span> <span data-start="1828.21" data-end="1832.5">is not good yet and then when we mark it</span> <span data-start="1832.5" data-end="1834.69">we're keeping this listing of all of the</span> <span data-start="1834.69" data-end="1836.85">statements that we've emitted so far so</span> <span data-start="1836.85" data-end="1838.71">we know what the next one what the the</span> <span data-start="1838.71" data-end="1840.57">location of the next one is going to be</span> <span data-start="1840.57" data-end="1843.42">so mark assigns that location to</span> <span data-start="1843.42" data-end="1848.85">whatever literal node you pass into it</span> <span data-start="1848.85" data-end="1851.22">and goes I haven't initializes it and</span> <span data-start="1851.22" data-end="1852.6">had some assertions about it not being</span> <span data-start="1852.6" data-end="1855.96">already initialized and so forth so once</span> <span data-start="1855.96" data-end="1857.25">we've marked something we know that</span> <span data-start="1857.25" data-end="1859.44">we're going to emit a case statement in</span> <span data-start="1859.44" data-end="1862.08">the in the switch statement eventually</span> <span data-start="1862.08" data-end="1866.91">all right so b dot literal and in that</span> <span data-start="1866.91" data-end="1868.95">literal maybe a little confusing those</span> <span data-start="1868.95" data-end="1871.62">are actually provided by recast if if</span> <span data-start="1871.62" data-end="1873.9">you recall you could say require recast</span> <span data-start="1873.9" data-end="1875.94">at types that builders that literal and</span> <span data-start="1875.94" data-end="1879.23">require recast at types that named types</span> <span data-start="1879.23" data-end="1882.409">cool</span> <span data-start="1882.419" data-end="1884.609">right so this is an example about how</span> <span data-start="1884.609" data-end="1888.119">that jump if not thing works and it's</span> <span data-start="1888.119" data-end="1890.429">pretty straightforward but I'm not going</span> <span data-start="1890.429" data-end="1893.519">to spend time on it right now basically</span> <span data-start="1893.519" data-end="1895.409">you do some assertions and you try to</span> <span data-start="1895.409" data-end="1898.859">avoid having double negation if possible</span> <span data-start="1898.859" data-end="1900.359">just because that was a problem that I</span> <span data-start="1900.359" data-end="1902.369">could fix and it makes the code nicer</span> <span data-start="1902.369" data-end="1906.049">and then you emit an if statement that</span> <span data-start="1906.049" data-end="1909.629">sets the context next property to the</span> <span data-start="1909.629" data-end="1910.739">next location that you want to jump to</span> <span data-start="1910.739" data-end="1915.23">and also admit a break statement so I</span> <span data-start="1915.23" data-end="1917.82">know I race through that but I think it</span> <span data-start="1917.82" data-end="1919.23">will be self-explanatory if you were to</span> <span data-start="1919.23" data-end="1922.109">go back and look at it all right so</span> <span data-start="1922.109" data-end="1927.21">explode statement is the last of the</span> <span data-start="1927.21" data-end="1929.22">sort of drill down examples that I want</span> <span data-start="1929.22" data-end="1931.71">to talk about I don't think I actually</span> <span data-start="1931.71" data-end="1934.139">have time to go through it but the</span> <span data-start="1934.139" data-end="1939.059">interesting part about it is that recast</span> <span data-start="1939.059" data-end="1941.879">or sorry regenerator understands whether</span> <span data-start="1941.879" data-end="1944.789">a statement or an expression contains</span> <span data-start="1944.789" data-end="1946.859">any yield expressions or any problematic</span> <span data-start="1946.859" data-end="1950.489">breaks or continues and if it doesn't if</span> <span data-start="1950.489" data-end="1952.529">it doesn't in my terminology contain</span> <span data-start="1952.529" data-end="1955.739">leap then we can just omit the statement</span> <span data-start="1955.739" data-end="1958.049">as it was so a large part of the</span> <span data-start="1958.049" data-end="1960.989">performance promises of regenerator are</span> <span data-start="1960.989" data-end="1962.73">that if you're not using yield in a</span> <span data-start="1962.73" data-end="1964.859">certain part of your code it just is</span> <span data-start="1964.859" data-end="1969.149">left untouched you could imagine you</span> <span data-start="1969.149" data-end="1970.859">know exploding everything out into a big</span> <span data-start="1970.859" data-end="1972.359">state machine that is much longer than</span> <span

data-start="1978.59" data-end="1982.429">performant or very easily compressible</span> <span data-start="1982.429" data-end="1985.379">okay another exciting part is what</span> <span data-start="1985.379" data-end="1986.999">happens if an exception gets thrown in</span> <span data-start="1986.999" data-end="1989.009">the middle of the state machine and the</span> <span data-start="1989.009" data-end="1990.84">secret to that is remembering where you</span> <span data-start="1990.84" data-end="1993.57">last knew that you were and having a</span> <span data-start="1993.57" data-end="1996.809">little map that can be inspected to</span> <span data-start="1996.809" data-end="2000.049">figure out what try statement or catch</span> <span data-start="2000.049" data-end="2002.09">block or finally block you're inside of</span> <span data-start="2002.09" data-end="2006.83">and sort of twiddles context next and</span> <span data-start="2006.83" data-end="2009.44">then calls back into the generator and</span> <span data-start="2009.44" data-end="2012.95">so you appear to resume at the the place</span> <span data-start="2012.95" data-end="2015.71">where you expected to for instance you</span> <span data-start="2015.71" data-end="2017.679">an exception is thrown by this block</span> <span data-start="2017.679" data-end="2020.779">you'll resume in the code that was</span> <span data-start="2020.779" data-end="2023.96">emitted for the catch block so this</span> <span data-start="2023.96" data-end="2026.059">whole example actually works and ends up</span> <span data-start="2026.059" data-end="2029.36">being surprisingly short and I'll I'll</span> <span data-start="2029.36"

data-end="2038.63">runtime code that supports all of that</span> <span data-start="2038.63" data-end="2040.22">and the interesting thing about this is</span> <span data-start="2040.22" data-end="2042.35">that it's invoking this in the very</span> <span data-start="2042.35" data-end="2044.09">middle the inner function that's the</span> <span data-start="2044.09" data-end="2045.14">function with the switch statement</span> <span data-start="2045.14" data-end="2047.63">inside of it that we've been talking</span> <span data-start="2047.63"

data-end="2073.28">in the exceptional control path all</span> <span data-start="2073.28" data-end="2076.04">right so the good news is as mentioned</span> <span data-start="2076.04" data-end="2077.599">earlier this is pretty much as hard as</span> <span data-start="2077.599" data-end="2079.849">it gets which may not sound like good</span> <span data-start="2079.849"

data-end="2088.31">while to wrap my head around these</span> <span data-start="2088.31" data-end="2091.97">things and so it's means nothing if it</span> <span data-start="2091.97" data-end="2094.46">if it takes you a while to wrap your</span> <span data-start="2094.46" data-end="2097.31">head around them as well but if you pick</span> <span data-start="2097.31"

data-end="2104.33">or in the end how tractable it is then</span> <span data-start="2104.33" data-end="2107.18">that's great and you can do a lot of</span> <span data-start="2107.18" data-end="2109.31">smaller things like adding support for</span> <span data-start="2109.31" data-end="2111.26">async functions and weight expressions</span> <span data-start="2111.26" data-end="2114.56">to the language in like this much code</span> <span data-start="2114.56" data-end="2116.39">this is the entire run time for that</span> <span data-start="2116.39" data-end="2118.67">really cool acma script 7 feature that's</span> <span data-start="2118.67" data-end="2119.96">coming down the pipe and that's already</span> <span data-start="2119.96"
