<p><span data-start="112.649" data-end="114.72">QL that everyone talks about is how you</span> <span data-start="114.72" data-end="116.549">can actually get exactly the data that</span> <span data-start="116.549" data-end="119.04">you need to fill your layouts your</span> <span data-start="119.04" data-end="120.99">components so say that you have this</span> <span data-start="120.99" data-end="123.689">layout ok so this is like a widget with</span> <span data-start="123.689" data-end="125.549">a feature director we have they're</span> <span data-start="125.549" data-end="127.619">showing a couple of themes and each film</span> <span data-start="127.619" data-end="130.27">showing some of its outdoors</span> <span data-start="130.27" data-end="132.01">so the way that you actually fetch the</span> <span data-start="132.01" data-end="134.74">data through mmm through okay well</span> <span data-start="134.74" data-end="137.11">actually you need to get data so in the</span> <span data-start="137.11" data-end="138.91">case of the director we need to get the</span> <span data-start="138.91" data-end="141.61">name the country on the avatar then for</span> <span data-start="141.61" data-end="143.08">each of the things we have the thumbnail</span> <span data-start="143.08" data-end="145.6">and the time and then for reactors we</span> <span data-start="145.6" data-end="148.3">have the avatar and the name so graph QL</span> <span data-start="148.3" data-end="150.67">is very straightforward you can define a</span> <span data-start="150.67" data-end="152.74">scheme and then you define a query that</span> <span data-start="152.74" data-end="155.11">lets you get the data as you need it and</span> <span data-start="155.11" data-end="157.21">what you're actually get from this is a</span> <span data-start="157.21" data-end="159.07">response with the data in the structure</span> <span data-start="159.07" data-end="160.54">as you need it so this is actually quite</span> <span data-start="160.54" data-end="162.79">cool right you get exactly what you need</span> <span data-start="162.79" data-end="165.13">so this is improvement of a rest and why</span> <span data-start="165.13" data-end="168.55">is taking over from rest and this plays</span> <span data-start="168.55" data-end="170.68">very nicely with components so if you're</span> <span data-start="170.68" data-end="172.33">actually guys calling with Riyadh and</span> <span data-start="172.33" data-end="175.68">buges I guess that's in the situation</span> <span data-start="175.68" data-end="180.07">you will actually love graph QL because</span> <span data-start="180.07" data-end="182.71">it goes one-to-one with with with the</span> <span data-start="182.71" data-end="184.3">concept of components so in this</span> <span data-start="184.3" data-end="186.16">situation we have an outer component</span> <span data-start="186.16" data-end="190.36">called feature director which has a film</span> <span data-start="190.36" data-end="192.52">it iterates over the list of films and</span> <span data-start="192.52" data-end="195.46">each film component has an called an</span> <span data-start="195.46" data-end="199.03">actor component okay and if you actually</span> <span data-start="199.03" data-end="200.92">pay attention to this is exactly the</span> <span data-start="200.92" data-end="203.56">same structure so very practical for</span> <span data-start="203.56" data-end="206.59">this so so far so good graph QL is</span> <span data-start="206.59" data-end="209.83">awesome but it is not perfect and</span> <span data-start="209.83" data-end="211.63">luckily so it comes with a few</span> <span data-start="211.63" data-end="213.91">limitations or trade-offs we can</span> <span data-start="213.91" data-end="216.85">actually say so one of the trade-offs is</span> <span data-start="216.85" data-end="218.59">that it is not catchable on the back end</span> <span data-start="218.59" data-end="222.73">you can still cache the aquarium but it</span> <span data-start="222.73" data-end="224.62">has to be on the client side and there</span> <span data-start="224.62" data-end="226.48">is a penalty for that because you're</span> <span data-start="226.48" data-end="228.76">adding code to the front-end you had to</span> <span data-start="228.76" data-end="230.17">part the JavaScript you had to execute</span> <span data-start="230.17" data-end="232.98">the JavaScript sorry not ideal okay</span> <span data-start="232.98" data-end="235.39">another problem is that this is</span> <span data-start="235.39" data-end="238.45">acceptable to denial of service attacks</span> <span data-start="238.45" data-end="240.4">because now you're given a lot of power</span> <span data-start="240.4" data-end="242.41">to the client to fetch whatever data</span> <span data-start="242.41" data-end="247.57">they want so if any evil person they</span> <span data-start="247.57" data-end="250.72">won't actually take your database down</span> <span data-start="250.72" data-end="253.36">they can actually execute a very complex</span> <span data-start="253.36" data-end="256.06">query that maybe you're thoroughly like</span> <span data-start="256.06" data-end="258.04">take one second to process it doesn't</span> <span data-start="258.04" data-end="260.68">seem so much but actually doing that for</span> <span data-start="260.68" data-end="262.63">many many thousands of course can</span> <span data-start="262.63" data-end="264.1">actually take the data rate down on your</span> <span data-start="264.1" data-end="264.699">server</span> <span data-start="264.699" data-end="267.009">so once again they can be mitigated</span> <span data-start="267.009" data-end="270.07">they're like strategies for dealing with</span> <span data-start="270.07" data-end="274">the with these gos attacks but it's all</span> <span data-start="274" data-end="275.59">in complexity to the application now you</span> <span data-start="275.59" data-end="276.85">had to actually think about the</span> <span data-start="276.85" data-end="278.5">complexity of the query you have to</span> <span data-start="278.5" data-end="281.169">think out the nested that the depth of</span> <span data-start="281.169" data-end="282.85">the query you can limit that you can</span> <span data-start="282.85" data-end="284.47">actually think about timeout so once</span> <span data-start="284.47" data-end="288.639">again this is not ideal so let me</span> <span data-start="288.639" data-end="289.69">present you a project that I've been</span> <span data-start="289.69" data-end="292.389">working on that it's called the</span> <span data-start="292.389" data-end="295.81">component based API and before anything</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="295.81" data-end="297.22">I need to say it's a work in progress</span> <span data-start="297.22" data-end="299.02">and it will be released in a few months</span> <span data-start="299.02" data-end="301.51">so I'm kind of sorry about this I wanted</span> <span data-start="301.51" data-end="303.789">to finish it for J's conf</span> <span data-start="303.789" data-end="305.74">be here saying okay we're releasing it</span> <span data-start="305.74" data-end="309.07">today and you know I mean a planning</span> <span data-start="309.07" data-end="310.93">time management of time is one of the</span> <span data-start="310.93" data-end="312.699">most complex things in software</span> <span data-start="312.699" data-end="315.58">development so it hasn't happened it has</span> <span data-start="315.58" data-end="316.93">been like two months away from being</span> <span data-start="316.93" data-end="320.77">ready for like six months now and still</span> <span data-start="320.77" data-end="324.4">a few months away so yeah I'm sorry</span> <span data-start="324.4" data-end="327.699">about this but everything that I'm going</span> <span data-start="327.699" data-end="329.53">to show you now is working all the</span> <span data-start="329.53" data-end="331.21">fundamental having implemented and I</span> <span data-start="331.21" data-end="332.47">also have it running on a couple of</span> <span data-start="332.47" data-end="335.919">production sites so whatever you will</span> <span data-start="335.919" data-end="338.08">actually see here is pretty much there</span> <span data-start="338.08" data-end="339.49">okay I'm not talking I'm not bluffing</span> <span data-start="339.49" data-end="341.229">everything I will show is actually</span> <span data-start="341.229" data-end="345.19">working I will try to do this following</span> <span data-start="345.19" data-end="348.039">the example by graphical of having an</span> <span data-start="348.039" data-end="350.38">open specification so then you can</span> <span data-start="350.38" data-end="351.639">implement it for different technologies</span> <span data-start="351.639" data-end="353.47">and how different systems interact with</span> <span data-start="353.47" data-end="354.93">each other independently of their</span> <span data-start="354.93" data-end="357.19">underlying implementation that's pretty</span> <span data-start="357.19" data-end="360.639">cool what it is and finally it's a</span> <span data-start="360.639" data-end="362.38">recognition that not everything is bad</span> <span data-start="362.38" data-end="365.289">about rest so graph QL is actually</span> <span data-start="365.289" data-end="367">taking over from rest not because rest</span> <span data-start="367" data-end="369.28">is pal both have advantages and</span> <span data-start="369.28" data-end="372.33">disadvantages and actually they may even</span> <span data-start="372.33" data-end="374.38">complement each other in the sense that</span> <span data-start="374.38" data-end="376.72">res has advantages that graphical does</span> <span data-start="376.72" data-end="380.05">not have and the other way around so I</span> <span data-start="380.05" data-end="382">was actually thinking this is actually</span> <span data-start="382" data-end="383.65">pretty cool from retina to discard that</span> <span data-start="383.65" data-end="385.57">and were actually try to do is to get</span> <span data-start="385.57" data-end="388.03">the best from both approaches which is</span> <span data-start="388.03" data-end="391.27">what I'm going to show you now so mostly</span> <span data-start="391.27" data-end="394.75">concerning fetching data basically the</span> <span data-start="394.75" data-end="396.4">good thing about graph QL is that it</span> <span data-start="396.4" data-end="398.11">allows you to fetch the data that you</span> <span data-start="398.11" data-end="399.82">need exactly that and that was the big</span> <span data-start="399.82" data-end="401.86">problem with rest so I actually took</span> <span data-start="401.86" data-end="404.11">this it allows you to fetch exactly the</span> <span data-start="404.11" data-end="405.25">data that you need like Rafkin</span> <span data-start="405.25" data-end="410.11">but it has an interface like rest so if</span> <span data-start="410.11" data-end="412.12">in graph curl you have a Korean of this</span> <span data-start="412.12" data-end="413.98">type you have a feature detector with a</span> <span data-start="413.98" data-end="417.43">few properties then film with a few</span> <span data-start="417.43" data-end="420.43">properties and then an actor the way</span> <span data-start="420.43" data-end="422.35">that I translate this through the URL is</span> <span data-start="422.35" data-end="424.48">first I get the properties for the</span> <span data-start="424.48" data-end="428.34">director and I pass it through a field</span> <span data-start="428.34" data-end="432.1">parameter on the uran then I get the</span> <span data-start="432.1" data-end="434.95">property for the film and I also passes</span> <span data-start="434.95" data-end="436.69">through the fields parameter in a kind</span> <span data-start="436.69" data-end="439.24">of dot notation so it now films to</span> <span data-start="439.24" data-end="441.58">tighten and then a pipe thumbnail to say</span> <span data-start="441.58" data-end="443.29">this property or that probably watch a</span> <span data-start="443.29" data-end="445.96">deeper the and that property and finally</span> <span data-start="445.96" data-end="447.97">once again for the actors starting from</span> <span data-start="447.97" data-end="451.57">the root films dot actors dot name pipe</span> <span data-start="451.57" data-end="454.93">avatar so having these syntax I can</span> <span data-start="454.93" data-end="457.54">actually query the the service from the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="457.54" data-end="460.45">URL so we have solved the catch ability</span> <span data-start="460.45" data-end="463.09">issue because now my URL is my</span> <span data-start="463.09" data-end="465.67">identifier and I can actually cache this</span> <span data-start="465.67" data-end="467.32">in the backend so that's the first thing</span> <span data-start="467.32" data-end="469.6">that is actually solved a combination</span> <span data-start="469.6" data-end="472.45">from rest and graphical now concerning</span> <span data-start="472.45" data-end="474.67">the shape of the data that were actually</span> <span data-start="474.67" data-end="478.78">fetching so in graph QL what you have is</span> <span data-start="478.78" data-end="481.36">that the shape of the data mirrors one</span> <span data-start="481.36" data-end="484.78">to one their query right you say give me</span> <span data-start="484.78" data-end="486.16">future director and then the future</span> <span data-start="486.16" data-end="488.56">director has the film and if you has a</span> <span data-start="488.56" data-end="490.93">doctor and you're actually returning</span> <span data-start="490.93" data-end="493.15">exactly that same shape but I decide to</span> <span data-start="493.15" data-end="496.3">use the structure as the data has been</span> <span data-start="496.3" data-end="499.24">defined on the database assuming there</span> <span data-start="499.24" data-end="501.22">is an SQL database maybe this doesn't</span> <span data-start="501.22" data-end="503.29">make much sense within no SQL database</span> <span data-start="503.29" data-end="505.09">but you have an SQL database that you</span> <span data-start="505.09" data-end="507.01">have like tables and you're thinking of</span> <span data-start="507.01" data-end="509.2">rows and columns okay and then you have</span> <span data-start="509.2" data-end="510.91">relationships among the entities that</span> <span data-start="510.91" data-end="511.54">you have an ID</span> <span data-start="511.54" data-end="513.34">pointing to an object on another table</span> <span data-start="513.34" data-end="517.229">so that was my model on which I actually</span> <span data-start="517.229" data-end="520.33">implemented this so once again this is</span> <span data-start="520.33" data-end="521.83">graph QL this is how you get the</span> <span data-start="521.83" data-end="524.2">response and what we have in this other</span> <span data-start="524.2" data-end="529.59">paradigm is databases and then you</span> <span data-start="529.59" data-end="532.5">this you can call it the table sort of I</span> <span data-start="532.5" data-end="534.6">call it people with the idea of the</span> <span data-start="534.6" data-end="536.85">entity okay now he has the name the</span> <span data-start="536.85" data-end="539.94">country

you</span> <span data-start="714.449" data-end="715.889">use the data right I mean how do I know</span> <span data-start="715.889" data-end="717.869">which is the data that I need to show in</span>

data-end="780.689">with ID 1 name country avatar and then</span> <span data-start="780.689" data-end="783.289">films and then he gives me the ID of the</span> <span data-start="783.289" data-end="787.079">films from this guy so and it is 1 and 2</span> <span data-start="787.079" data-end="789.899">where do I retrieve this data from here</span> <span data-start="789.899" data-end="791.83">it says from the</span> <span data-start="791.83" data-end="794.589">key under films which is called films</span> <span data-start="794.589" data-end="797.38">also so now we come to films and he</span> <span data-start="797.38" data-end="799.99">gives me the entity okay Tyler thumbnail</span> <span data-start="799.99" data-end="802.06">actors and I trust he gives me the</span>

data-start="813.399" data-end="816.64">okay so now in people two and three we</span> <span data-start="816.64" data-end="818.709">have these entities and you can see that</span> <span

data-end="1262.49">okay you can repeat call it makes sense</span> <span data-start="1262.49" data-end="1265.25">okay with this architecture they no need</span> <span data-start="1265.25" data-end="1267.02">for that because this is how the</span> <span data-start="1267.02" data-end="1269.08">component looks like in the front end</span> <span data-start="1269.08" data-end="1271.85">okay it's extremely decoupled from all</span> <span data-start="1271.85" data-end="1274.309">of its children so then they know a prop</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1274.309" data-end="1279.29">Clips it just cannot happen so every</span> <span data-start="1279.29" data-end="1282.26">component creates its context on the</span> <span

data-end="1340.45">on the backend is that you define the</span> <span data-start="1340.45" data-end="1341.59">relationships among all of these</span> <span data-start="1341.59"
