<p><span data-start="148.87" data-end="151.33">Scott page and the central premise of</span> <span data-start="151.33" data-end="153.4">his research is that diversity Trump's</span> <span data-start="153.4" data-end="155.319">ability when it comes to creating great</span> <span data-start="155.319" data-end="158.019">outcomes so the first thing he does is</span> <span data-start="158.019" data-end="161.38">defined what cognitive diversity is I'm</span> <span data-start="161.38" data-end="162.91">not going to read this whole slide you</span> <span data-start="162.91" data-end="164.44">can go and find the book if you want</span> <span data-start="164.44" data-end="166.33">more information but essentially it's a</span> <span data-start="166.33" data-end="167.98">difference in terms of our perspectives</span> <span data-start="167.98" data-end="170.5">and how we use those to construct</span> <span data-start="170.5" data-end="172.209">different models and predictions and</span> <span data-start="172.209" data-end="174.4">methods for finding solutions so that's</span> <span data-start="174.4" data-end="177.489">cognitive diversity he looked at problem</span> <span data-start="177.489" data-end="180.01">solving capabilities of high-performing</span> <span data-start="180.01" data-end="181.66">but homogeneous groups of thinkers</span> <span data-start="181.66" data-end="185.14">compared to less experienced but very</span> <span data-start="185.14" data-end="187.12">diverse thinkers and he found pretty</span> <span data-start="187.12" data-end="189.04">conclusively that for certain kinds of</span> <span data-start="189.04" data-end="191.739">problem-solving diverse groups performed</span> <span data-start="191.739" data-end="194.92">much better so this wasn't true for all</span> <span data-start="194.92" data-end="197.2">tasks routine tasks like flipping</span> <span data-start="197.2" data-end="199.81">burgers and mechanical things virtually</span> <span data-start="199.81" data-end="202.569">no benefit for tasa had to be performed</span> <span data-start="202.569" data-end="204.91">in isolation by individuals like some of</span> <span data-start="204.91" data-end="207.19">the early software development work</span> <span data-start="207.19" data-end="209.5">better for individuals with experience</span> <span data-start="209.5" data-end="213.01">but the most benefit beneficial was</span> <span data-start="213.01" data-end="215.62">disjunctive tasks so group performance</span> <span data-start="215.62" data-end="217.81">being disproportionately dependent on</span> <span data-start="217.81" data-end="219.67">the strongest member in different cases</span> <span data-start="219.67" data-end="222.34">and that's really interesting because</span> <span data-start="222.34" data-end="224.29">modern software development is to a</span> <span data-start="224.29" data-end="226.75">large extent disjunctive so for any</span> <span data-start="226.75" data-end="228.87">particular problem and set of problems</span> <span data-start="228.87" data-end="231.22">there's different cognitive abilities</span> <span data-start="231.22" data-end="232.389">that will solve particular problems</span> <span data-start="232.389" data-end="235.389">better in open source solutions rise to</span> <span data-start="235.389" data-end="238.139">the top without being blocked by other</span> <span data-start="238.139" data-end="240.76">processes and it allows for outliers to</span> <span data-start="240.76" data-end="243.04">rise when they're needed which is pretty</span> <span data-start="243.04" data-end="246.97">cool so yeah diversity of experience</span> <span data-start="246.97" data-end="248.739">matters to open source it's a perfect</span> <span data-start="248.739" data-end="251.88">problem for diversity and that's awesome</span> <span data-start="251.88" data-end="254.319">so now you guys have a pretty robust</span> <span data-start="254.319" data-end="256.66">understanding of what diversity is and</span> <span data-start="256.66" data-end="259.32">why it matters let's talk implementation</span> <span data-start="259.32" data-end="261.729">so I'm going to show you some things you</span> <span data-start="261.729" data-end="263.229">can do when you go back to your jobs</span> <span data-start="263.229" data-end="265.09">that will help attract more contributors</span> <span data-start="265.09" data-end="268.09">and more importantly maximize the value</span> <span data-start="268.09" data-end="268.72">you get</span> <span data-start="268.72" data-end="272.05">from those contributors so let's start</span> <span data-start="272.05" data-end="273.7">with code contributors it's something we</span> <span data-start="273.7" data-end="276.73">know so cognitive diversity is really</span> <span data-start="276.73" data-end="278.11">important for good engineering we</span> <span data-start="278.11" data-end="279.94">learned that already because it's</span> <span data-start="279.94" data-end="283.12">largely a distant disjunctive process</span> <span data-start="283.12" data-end="285.28">and it's really important remember that</span> <span data-start="285.28" data-end="287.02">individuals who may not have the same</span> <span data-start="287.02" data-end="290.59">domain experience will actually come up</span> <span data-start="290.59" data-end="291.97">with better solutions to certain</span> <span data-start="291.97" data-end="294.01">problems that's not true of all problems</span> <span data-start="294.01" data-end="295.69">it's not probably going to be true for</span> <span data-start="295.69" data-end="298.54">like re-architecting some of your app</span> <span data-start="298.54" data-end="300.1">but it's going to be interesting for</span> <span data-start="300.1" data-end="301.78">like new problems that nobody knows how</span> <span data-start="301.78" data-end="304.3">to solve so how do we support different</span> <span data-start="304.3" data-end="305.95">areas of expertise without slowing</span> <span data-start="305.95" data-end="308.47">contributors down and ourselves as core</span> <span data-start="308.47" data-end="310.66">contributors one of the best ways is to</span> <span data-start="310.66" data-end="313.69">make reducing dependencies on domain</span> <span data-start="313.69" data-end="317.23">knowledge and project history so one way</span> <span data-start="317.23" data-end="318.88">you can do that is by splitting your</span> <span data-start="318.88" data-end="320.68">codebase into modules so if you have</span> <span data-start="320.68" data-end="322.84">like a huge legacy code base and it's</span> <span data-start="322.84" data-end="324.58">impossible to fix all the docs at once</span> <span data-start="324.58" data-end="327.15">consider releasing part of it as modules</span> <span data-start="327.15" data-end="329.65">so one things we did on the web maker</span> <span data-start="329.65" data-end="331.57">project is we decide to take all of our</span> <span data-start="331.57" data-end="334.66">style and CSS put it on a bootstrap API</span> <span data-start="334.66" data-end="337.06">and release it as a separate module so</span> <span data-start="337.06" data-end="338.62">that contributors who are interested in</span> <span data-start="338.62" data-end="342.16">contributing to just like our UI and our</span> <span data-start="342.16" data-end="343.96">style could actually hack on that</span> <span data-start="343.96" data-end="346.78">without setting up our crazy stack with</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="346.78" data-end="351.55">Redis and mongodb and all that stuff so</span> <span data-start="351.55" data-end="353.59">another consequence of cognitive</span> <span data-start="353.59" data-end="355.63">diversity is that communicating and</span> <span data-start="355.63" data-end="357.19">decision-making becomes way more</span> <span data-start="357.19" data-end="359.68">difficult you already know this because</span> <span data-start="359.68" data-end="361.39">there's already a huge diversity of</span> <span data-start="361.39" data-end="363.85">opinions in your open source projects</span> <span data-start="363.85" data-end="365.68">and you have to be really really mindful</span> <span data-start="365.68" data-end="368.71">about how that affects newcomers I can't</span> <span data-start="368.71" data-end="372.04">tell you how to be an expert in dealing</span> <span data-start="372.04" data-end="374.62">with conflict if you miss Jen's talk a</span> <span data-start="374.62" data-end="376.66">couple of days ago on emotional safety I</span> <span data-start="376.66" data-end="379.14">highly recommend you check it out</span> <span data-start="379.14" data-end="381.52">another thing you can do is consider a</span> <span data-start="381.52" data-end="384.7">code of conduct so code of contacts have</span> <span data-start="384.7" data-end="387.16">been in use for a while especially with</span> <span data-start="387.16" data-end="389.59">events in the event space what they do</span> <span data-start="389.59" data-end="391.72">is they help resolve conflicts they make</span> <span data-start="391.72" data-end="395.14">people feel safe and they're coming into</span> <span data-start="395.14" data-end="397.05">their space of code contribution to you</span> <span data-start="397.05" data-end="400.599">so one example of this is Mozilla house</span> <span data-start="400.599" data-end="401.39">community</span> <span data-start="401.39" data-end="403.28">patient guidelines they're pretty broad</span> <span data-start="403.28" data-end="405.14">they cover all kinds of contribution</span> <span data-start="405.14" data-end="406.82">they're really good guidelines for</span> <span data-start="406.82" data-end="408.74">dealing with new members you can take a</span> <span data-start="408.74" data-end="411.59">look at that but another project that I</span> <span data-start="411.59" data-end="413.3">recently came across that we're trying</span> <span data-start="413.3" data-end="416.09">to incorporate into our code base is the</span> <span data-start="416.09" data-end="418.25">contributor code of conduct which is</span> <span data-start="418.25" data-end="420.47">something that is intended to be a</span> <span data-start="420.47" data-end="423.02">closer to your files on github so</span> <span data-start="423.02" data-end="425.99">something alongside contributor md and</span> <span data-start="425.99" data-end="427.67">it talks about specific behaviors and</span> <span data-start="427.67" data-end="429.65">github issues and dealing with code</span> <span data-start="429.65" data-end="432.38">contribution specifically so there's a</span> <span data-start="432.38" data-end="433.34">couple of projects that are already</span> <span data-start="433.34" data-end="435.59">using it angular is one of them if you</span> <span data-start="435.59" data-end="437.42">want to check it out for kit contribute</span> <span data-start="437.42" data-end="442.1">definitely take a look at that link okay</span> <span data-start="442.1" data-end="447.17">let's get some water all right so code</span> <span data-start="447.17" data-end="451.01">contribution is awesome and so now we</span> <span data-start="451.01" data-end="453.29">know how to equip our code for a better</span> <span data-start="453.29" data-end="455.18">place for newcomers but I think it's</span> <span data-start="455.18" data-end="456.83">also critical that we expand our</span> <span data-start="456.83" data-end="458.81">definition of contributor and this is</span> <span data-start="458.81" data-end="460.82">really what I want to talk about the</span> <span data-start="460.82" data-end="462.47">most is taking advantage of the full</span> <span data-start="462.47" data-end="464.21">range of human talent that's available</span> <span data-start="464.21" data-end="467.81">to us so like that's pretty stupid right</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.81" data-end="470.86">I mean assuming that the only part of</span> <span data-start="470.86" data-end="473.42">our what we're working on can improve</span> <span data-start="473.42" data-end="475.88">from collaborative iteration is code is</span> <span data-start="475.88" data-end="478.34">completely ludicrous even if you're</span> <span data-start="478.34"

first thing I want to talk about on</span> <span data-start="489.47" data-end="491.18">this extremely relevant to software</span> <span data-start="491.18" data-end="492.92">develop it up development that you can</span> <span data-start="492.92" data-end="495.5">get contributors is user research how</span> <span data-start="495.5" data-end="497.41">many people know what user research is</span> <span data-start="497.41" data-end="503">yay sort of lots of people so I'm going</span> <span data-start="503" data-end="504.68">to talk about specifically a kind of</span> <span data-start="504.68" data-end="507.41">user research called user testing and</span> <span data-start="507.41" data-end="509.27">basically what that is is does my</span> <span data-start="509.27" data-end="511.22">software work the way I expect it to you</span> <span data-start="511.22" data-end="513.83">and I got to tell you based on what</span> <span data-start="513.83" data-end="516.14">we've done with user research it often</span> <span data-start="516.14" data-end="520.01">doesn't so again the idea here is to</span> <span data-start="520.01" data-end="522.08">rely on people who have more expertise</span> <span data-start="522.08" data-end="523.64">and access to communities that are</span> <span data-start="523.64" data-end="526.04">valuable to you to do the user testing</span> <span data-start="526.04" data-end="528.41">for you what you have to do first is to</span> <span data-start="528.41" data-end="530.12">write tasks that are relevant to your</span> <span data-start="530.12" data-end="531.68">project so that they can actually hold</span> <span data-start="531.68" data-end="535.1">user testing so how does that look look</span> <span data-start="535.1" data-end="537.92">kind of looks like testing but not you</span> <span data-start="537.92" data-end="539.93">kind of write down some expectations</span> <span data-start="539.93" data-end="541.43">about new features that are landing or</span> <span data-start="541.43" data-end="543.529">problems you're seeing you do the</span> <span data-start="543.529" data-end="545.149">implementation and then you run user</span> <span data-start="545.149" data-end="546.949">testing or get your contributors to do</span> <span data-start="546.949" data-end="549.019">it to see if your expectations were</span> <span data-start="549.019" data-end="553.399">right these are some examples of what</span> <span data-start="553.399"
