<p><span data-start="0" data-end="13.11">I</span> <span data-start="13.12" data-end="16.4">so the topic of this talk is going to be</span> <span data-start="16.4" data-end="19.04">a performance beyond page load I'm glad</span> <span data-start="19.04" data-end="20.869">that Jeffrey gave a real good</span> <span data-start="20.869" data-end="22.16">introduction about the networking</span> <span data-start="22.16" data-end="23.779">performance so when you say the</span> <span data-start="23.779" data-end="25.49">performance of a web page is divided</span> <span data-start="25.49" data-end="27.26">into two components that is networking</span> <span data-start="27.26" data-end="28.52">performance and the rendering</span> <span data-start="28.52" data-end="30.619">performance while networking performance</span> <span data-start="30.619" data-end="32.239">takes care of your page load time and</span> <span data-start="32.239" data-end="35.33">the start render time rendering</span> <span data-start="35.33" data-end="37.73">performance will be taking care of the</span> <span data-start="37.73" data-end="40.19">performance of your interactions on a</span> <span data-start="40.19" data-end="42.05">web page so that is what we will be</span> <span data-start="42.05" data-end="44.66">focusing upon our goal will be to build</span> <span data-start="44.66" data-end="46.76">smooth interactions and even to</span> <span data-start="46.76" data-end="48.89">understand as toward the issues are if</span> <span data-start="48.89" data-end="51.829">there are any with your web page or your</span> <span data-start="51.829" data-end="54.079">interactions on your web page and how</span> <span data-start="54.079" data-end="56.03">you should take care of them so let's</span> <span data-start="56.03" data-end="58.969">start on we start off with a small</span> <span data-start="58.969" data-end="60.86">survey I guess with the show of friends</span> <span data-start="60.86" data-end="62.96">you can actually tell whether you belong</span> <span data-start="62.96" data-end="65.869">to it or not so my first question will</span> <span data-start="65.869" data-end="67.94">be how many of you like animations in</span> <span data-start="67.94" data-end="72.07">material design with a show friend okay</span> <span data-start="72.07" data-end="75.77">some people not not all of you but i</span> <span data-start="75.77" data-end="77.659">guess it's mostly related to the fact</span> <span data-start="77.659" data-end="79.34">that animations haven't been performing</span> <span data-start="79.34" data-end="82.79">very well on HTML right or it may be</span> <span data-start="82.79" data-end="84.71">performing well on native devices but</span> <span data-start="84.71" data-end="88.13">not on nom on your mobile in the mobile</span> <span data-start="88.13" data-end="90.59">browser so we are going to tackle such</span> <span data-start="90.59" data-end="92.51">issues in the coming in the coming</span> <span data-start="92.51" data-end="93.89">slides and I will be discussing them</span> <span data-start="93.89" data-end="98.72">briefly so you won't like animations if</span> <span data-start="98.72" data-end="100.909">they are not smooth our goal will be to</span> <span data-start="100.909" data-end="104.36">make sure that we have this things in</span> <span data-start="104.36" data-end="107.119">place we follow the best practices but</span> <span data-start="107.119" data-end="109.79">some people want to tell meet like hacks</span> <span data-start="109.79" data-end="112.549">right because it's not up to you to</span> <span data-start="112.549" data-end="114.049">actually take care of them it should be</span> <span data-start="114.049" data-end="118.04">the I mean it should be for the browsers</span> <span data-start="118.04" data-end="119.689">to actually make it sure that whatever</span> <span data-start="119.689" data-end="121.88">you have put in in your code actually is</span> <span data-start="121.88" data-end="124.34">performing and varied drones on the web</span> <span data-start="124.34" data-end="126.439">browser eight runs performant Lee that</span> <span data-start="126.439" data-end="129.29">is at 60fps so there is this a</span> <span data-start="129.29" data-end="130.7">mix-and-match of different things that I</span> <span data-start="130.7" data-end="133.28">will be talking about their hacks and</span> <span data-start="133.28" data-end="135.2">there are best practices and we'll be</span> <span data-start="135.2" data-end="138.739">discussing them so starting off with</span> <span data-start="138.739" data-end="141.169">rendering performance I just told you</span> <span data-start="141.169" data-end="142.579">about the goal which will be to build</span> <span data-start="142.579" data-end="144.95">smooth interactions so let's start with</span> <span data-start="144.95" data-end="145.18">the</span> <span data-start="145.18" data-end="147.879">a steady Archy study is basically about</span> <span data-start="147.879" data-end="151.689">a girl and a boy where the boy asks the</span> <span data-start="151.689" data-end="154.56">girl to marry him he proposes her and</span> <span data-start="154.56" data-end="157.84">luckily he is responded with an answer</span> <span data-start="157.84" data-end="162.939">which is yes so what next is shopping</span> <span data-start="162.939" data-end="165.639">shopping for that particular shopping</span> <span data-start="165.639" data-end="168.489">for that wedding basically and it is a</span> <span data-start="168.489" data-end="171.159">shopping that is up the the bride the</span> <span data-start="171.159" data-end="174.579">bridal couple is is shopping on on a</span> <span data-start="174.579" data-end="178.45">mobile website okay though what happens</span> <span data-start="178.45" data-end="181.45">next is something that we didn't</span> <span data-start="181.45" data-end="183.669">anticipate for but it is something what</span> <span data-start="183.669" data-end="186.43">happened so this is the reaction of the</span> <span data-start="186.43" data-end="189.159">girl after she was I mean going through</span> <span data-start="189.159" data-end="190.659">the mobile website and trying to</span> <span data-start="190.659" data-end="194.23">purchase from over there so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="194.23" data-end="195.969">look happy right so we need to make sure</span> <span data-start="195.969" data-end="198.189">that this reaction doesn't happen for</span> <span data-start="198.189" data-end="202.48">your own customers as well so the bad</span> <span data-start="202.48" data-end="205.06">performance of shopping portal it leads</span> <span data-start="205.06" data-end="208.06">to do I need to tell you that the bad</span> <span data-start="208.06" data-end="210.459">performance is basically the rendering</span> <span data-start="210.459" data-end="211.75">performance and not the networking</span> <span data-start="211.75" data-end="213.19">performance that will be discussing over</span> <span data-start="213.19" data-end="215.229">here over here we are talking about the</span> <span data-start="215.229" data-end="217.18">interactions that are there on a web</span> <span data-start="217.18" data-end="220.59">page and how they affected the</span> <span data-start="220.59" data-end="224.59">experience of that particular bride so</span> <span data-start="224.59" data-end="228.669">this is that followed next after after</span> <span data-start="228.669" data-end="230.349">that particular reaction this is</span> <span data-start="230.349" data-end="232.09">basically a meeting between developers</span> <span data-start="232.09" data-end="235.15">project managers and the testers to</span> <span data-start="235.15" data-end="237.819">understand as to what went wrong or what</span> <span data-start="237.819" data-end="240.819">can be the solution for improving the</span> <span data-start="240.819" data-end="242.799">rendering performance of their of their</span> <span data-start="242.799" data-end="246.31">mobile web application so i am not</span> <span data-start="246.31" data-end="248.079">actually going to focus upon just the</span> <span data-start="248.079" data-end="249.79">mobile web experience but it will be the</span> <span data-start="249.79" data-end="251.259">performance it will be the rendering</span> <span data-start="251.259" data-end="255.909">performance in general ok so wait up it</span> <span data-start="255.909" data-end="258.88">is so as far as now i have just told you</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="260.5">about the case study in general it was</span> <span data-start="260.5" data-end="263.05">simply about tom about the experience of</span> <span data-start="263.05" data-end="264.909">the customer how it impacted what are</span> <span data-start="264.909" data-end="266.169">the different things that people are</span> <span data-start="266.169" data-end="269.32">thinking about but let's take a</span> <span data-start="269.32" data-end="271.09">technical perspective regarding this and</span> <span data-start="271.09" data-end="272.889">understand as to what exactly happen</span> <span data-start="272.889" data-end="274.93">what is the technical issue around it</span> <span data-start="274.93" data-end="277.93">what what is it because of and what are</span> <span data-start="277.93" data-end="279.11">the different solutions that</span> <span data-start="279.11" data-end="282.55">you can actually use to overcome it okay</span> <span data-start="282.55" data-end="285.86">so a small commercial break this is</span> <span data-start="285.86" data-end="289.28">about me my name is a puta Saxena I hail</span> <span data-start="289.28" data-end="291.38">from India I work as a first second</span> <span data-start="291.38" data-end="294.11">junior and you can follow me at up would</span> <span data-start="294.11" data-end="296.3">underscore Saxena if you have any sort</span> <span data-start="296.3" data-end="297.35">of questions related to performance</span> <span data-start="297.35" data-end="299.63">whether we eat a networking performance</span> <span data-start="299.63" data-end="300.89">or the rendering performance you can</span> <span data-start="300.89" data-end="303.17">simply tweet up to me and I'll make sure</span> <span data-start="303.17" data-end="307.7">that I try to answer that the companies</span> <span data-start="307.7" data-end="309.62">that I've worked with and I'm working</span> <span data-start="309.62" data-end="311.63">with ving affair before that I had</span> <span data-start="311.63" data-end="313.22">worked with LinkedIn which is now a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="313.22" data-end="315.2">SlideShare which was now linkedin and</span> <span data-start="315.2" data-end="318.23">director some other conferences that I</span> <span data-start="318.23" data-end="320.39">have contributed to before the talks</span> <span data-start="320.39" data-end="322.64">mostly focused upon performance but it</span> <span data-start="322.64" data-end="325.43">was more about networking and even a bit</span> <span data-start="325.43" data-end="326.93">about gaming performance so in case you</span> <span data-start="326.93" data-end="330.05">want to check them out please do so</span> <span data-start="330.05" data-end="334.13">let's start off with basics ok so when I</span> <span data-start="334.13" data-end="336.5">talk about basics I actually come to</span> <span data-start="336.5" data-end="339.32">this I remember this picture from my</span> <span data-start="339.32" data-end="341.9">childhood which is about a Bioscope so</span> <span data-start="341.9" data-end="343.64">with a show of hands how many of you</span> <span data-start="343.64" data-end="347.42">understand what is a Bioscope ok just</span> <span data-start="347.42" data-end="349.85">one two three okay not not a lot of</span> <span data-start="349.85" data-end="351.26">people understand what is Bioscope so</span> <span data-start="351.26" data-end="353.51">basically it's a small device where</span> <span data-start="353.51" data-end="355.13">there are different stills of a</span> <span data-start="355.13" data-end="357.26">particular animation or a movie and they</span> <span data-start="357.26" data-end="358.85">are moved manually by a particular</span> <span data-start="358.85" data-end="361.1">person who is the owner of this</span> <span data-start="361.1" data-end="363.38">particular device and people will be</span> <span data-start="363.38" data-end="365.15">able to look through through these holes</span> <span data-start="365.15" data-end="367.07">that you can see the aluminum shells and</span> <span data-start="367.07" data-end="369.92">through that when a person moves those</span> <span data-start="369.92" data-end="372.37">stills it appears like an animated movie</span> <span data-start="372.37" data-end="374.96">so on the right you are able to see the</span> <span data-start="374.96" data-end="378.26">stills of the animation that is that is</span> <span data-start="378.26" data-end="379.73">played by the particular person and</span> <span data-start="379.73" data-end="382.58">that's how it is so this is a similar</span> <span data-start="382.58" data-end="388.63">concept that is followed when you even</span> <span data-start="388.63" data-end="390.8">when you even display a particular</span> <span data-start="390.8" data-end="392.72">picture on our on a screen so what</span> <span data-start="392.72" data-end="395.12">happens is that the devices refresh the</span> <span data-start="395.12" data-end="398.15">screen at 60 frames per second and that</span> <span data-start="398.15" data-end="400.49">is how they say that they are able to</span> <span data-start="400.49" data-end="402.77">display at 60fps or even more than that</span> <span data-start="402.77" data-end="405.53">like 120 fps so what is happening is</span> <span data-start="405.53" data-end="407.93">that there are 120 frames per second</span> <span data-start="407.93" data-end="410.59">that are played on a particular screen</span> <span data-start="410.59" data-end="412.9">the frame budget that</span> <span data-start="412.9" data-end="414.94">comes to us to make our particular</span> <span data-start="414.94" data-end="418.57">operation is 16 milliseconds how we did</span> <span data-start="418.57" data-end="420.28">this calculation is that in once again</span> <span data-start="420.28" data-end="422.56">you have to display 60 frames so you do</span> <span data-start="422.56" data-end="424.419">a simple calculation that is divided and</span> <span data-start="424.419" data-end="427.78">what you get is 16 milliseconds so in 16</span> <span data-start="427.78" data-end="430.15">milliseconds you have to make sure that</span> <span data-start="430.15" data-end="432.039">everything or every operation that you</span> <span data-start="432.039" data-end="434.47">are performing is under 16 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="434.47" data-end="438.07">if in case it exceeds 16 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="438.07" data-end="439.99">then you will be able to encounter</span> <span data-start="439.99" data-end="442.69">something that you won't want to though</span> <span data-start="442.69" data-end="444.669">there are also some other householding</span> <span data-start="444.669" data-end="446.74">works that a browser needs to needs to</span> <span data-start="446.74" data-end="449.32">take a while while carrying out your</span> <span data-start="449.32" data-end="451.72">operation which leaves you with just 10</span> <span data-start="451.72" data-end="454.24">milliseconds in total so you need to</span> <span data-start="454.24" data-end="455.26">actually make sure that whatever</span> <span data-start="455.26" data-end="456.94">operation you are performing is</span> <span data-start="456.94" data-end="459.1">completed in 10 milliseconds or less</span> <span data-start="459.1" data-end="462.88">than that and 10 milliseconds isn't a</span> <span data-start="462.88" data-end="466.539">lot of time when failing to meet 10</span> <span data-start="466.539" data-end="468.61">milliseconds we come across the behavior</span> <span data-start="468.61" data-end="470.5">which you don't like which is termed as</span> <span data-start="470.5" data-end="473.44">jank okay so if there's a scroll that</span> <span data-start="473.44" data-end="475.99">you're Rob doing and you see that there</span> <span data-start="475.99" data-end="478.12">is a lag in between what you will term</span> <span data-start="478.12" data-end="483.669">it with is will be jack so this is the</span> <span data-start="483.669" data-end="485.05">experience that I was talking about a</span> <span data-start="485.05" data-end="487.18">person is trying to scroll the page but</span> <span data-start="487.18" data-end="489.55">he seems but he sees that it's actually</span> <span data-start="489.55" data-end="491.789">not strolling the reason for it is that</span> <span data-start="491.789" data-end="495.19">it is so some operation is taking some a</span> <span data-start="495.19" data-end="498.01">lot of time okay which is not allowing</span> <span data-start="498.01" data-end="501.88">the pager to paint okay and because of</span> <span data-start="501.88" data-end="503.949">that he actually sees that there is a</span> <span data-start="503.949" data-end="505.9">jitter or a lag or basically he's</span> <span data-start="505.9" data-end="510.19">encountering jank so let's understand as</span> <span data-start="510.19" data-end="512.8">to how a browser renders a particular</span> <span data-start="512.8" data-end="515.74">draw a particular webpage or how a CSS</span> <span data-start="515.74" data-end="519.94">operation is applied onto a web page so</span> <span data-start="519.94" data-end="521.709">the pixel pipeline comprises of these</span> <span data-start="521.709" data-end="525.43">five stages if I may say it starts off</span> <span data-start="525.43" data-end="526.99">with JavaScript because most of the</span> <span data-start="526.99" data-end="528.85">interactions may trigger from JavaScript</span> <span data-start="528.85" data-end="532.15">it can also in the via CSS also which is</span> <span data-start="532.15" data-end="534.339">the second stage but let's think that</span> <span data-start="534.339" data-end="535.779">you have made some sort of interaction</span> <span data-start="535.779" data-end="538.72">and it goes to your JavaScript okay what</span> <span data-start="538.72" data-end="541.18">happens is that you do some sort of

data-start="577" data-end="579.58">layout is is an operation which is</span> <span data-start="579.58" data-end="582.22">triggered when you reposition or you</span> <span data-start="582.22" data-end="584.62">change the size of a particular element</span> <span data-start="584.62" data-end="586.779">so that basically triggers a layout</span> <span data-start="586.779"

it</span> <span data-start="632.5" data-end="634.779">trigger so over here you will be able to</span> <span data-start="634.779" data-end="637.48">see the CSS property for example width</span> <span data-start="637.48" data-end="639.31">it basically changes the size of a</span> <span data-start="639.31" data-end="641.17">particular element and thus is labeled</span> <span data-start="641.17" data-end="643.6">under the layout operation category that</span> <span data-start="643.6" data-end="646.63">is it triggers a layout operation comes</span> <span data-start="646.63" data-end="649.75">next is paint what is paint operation so</span> <span data-start="649.75" data-end="652.329">the paint operation is about when the</span> <span data-start="652.329" data-end="654.07">when the pixels of a particular element</span> <span data-start="654.07" data-end="655.87">are changed or they need to get</span> <span data-start="655.87" data-end="658.57">repainted that is that is how we define</span> <span data-start="658.57" data-end="660.76">a paint operation so when you actually</span> <span data-start="660.76" data-end="663.61">see that an element's layout has been</span> <span data-start="663.61" data-end="666.31">changed that as its size or position has</span> <span data-start="666.31" data-end="668.38">been changed so inside a web page there</span> <span data-start="668.38" data-end="669.97">might be some elements right which are</span> <span data-start="669.97" data-end="672.37">getting their pixels repainted so that</span> <span data-start="672.37" data-end="674.23">is why the paint operation is triggered</span> <span data-start="674.23" data-end="676.779">after layout but there are CSS rules</span> <span data-start="676.779" data-end="679.209">that allow you to just trigger the paint</span> <span data-start="679.209" data-end="680.17">operation</span> <span data-start="680.17" data-end="682.69">so let's understand that over here you</span> <span data-start="682.69" data-end="685.18">can see that paint comes after layout</span> <span data-start="685.18" data-end="687.43">operation but it can be triggered by a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="687.43" data-end="692.22">CSS property directly also so this is a</span> <span data-start="692.22" data-end="694.72">simple screenshot or we can see</span> <span data-start="694.72" data-end="697.029">different colored pictures though this</span> <span data-start="697.029" data-end="699.76">yes CSS property that is responsible for</span> <span

data-end="706.149">the layout are color background color</span> <span data-start="706.149" data-end="711.13">and and all of these CSS properties</span> <span data-start="711.13" data-end="713.019">they're all are responsible for</span> <span data-start="713.019" data-end="716.91">triggering a paint operation directly ok</span> <span data-start="716.91" data-end="719.82">the next comes in is composting</span> <span data-start="719.82" data-end="722.32">composting is an operation which allows</span> <span data-start="722.32" data-end="724.87">a browser to basically compose it</span> <span data-start="724.87" data-end="727.63">different layers together and render a</span> <span data-start="727.63" data-end="730.779">web page it comes the third in all of</span> <span data-start="730.779" data-end="732.399">these operations and the last in the</span> <span data-start="732.399" data-end="735.37">pixel pipeline ok so first comes in is a</span> <span data-start="735.37" data-end="737.529">layout operation comes next is paint and</span> <span data-start="737.529" data-end="739.72">then composition where all of the layers</span> <span

data-end="753.61">when there is a change the last step</span> <span data-start="753.61" data-end="755.56">that happens is this the composition of</span> <span data-start="755.56" data-end="759.67">different layers to render a web page so</span> <span data-start="759.67" data-end="763.48">this is the order of how what the</span> <span data-start="763.48" data-end="764.98">performance impact of different</span> <span data-start="764.98" data-end="768.49">operations have on in a pixel pipeline</span> <span data-start="768.49" data-end="771.22">the most impacted or the most expensive</span> <span data-start="771.22" data-end="774.49">operation to perform is layout followed</span> <span data-start="774.49" data-end="776.949">by paint and followed by

<span data-start="781.42" data-end="784.149">triggering itself but composite as well</span> <span data-start="784.149" data-end="786.43">and composite is the last operation</span> <span

data-end="808.75">composition operation is applied in case</span> <span data-start="808.75" data-end="812.89">of transform and opacity change okay so</span> <span data-start="812.89"
