<p><span data-start="105.72" data-end="107.1">I wanted to talk about today there's</span> <span data-start="107.1" data-end="109.049">been some awesome talks on like specific</span> <span data-start="109.049" data-end="111.24">things was happy whether it's features</span> <span data-start="111.24" data-end="115.259">how you use a certain thing or why why</span> <span data-start="115.259" data-end="117.75">choose happy so what I was what I was</span> <span data-start="117.75" data-end="119.399">hoping to talk about was pick a couple</span> <span data-start="119.399" data-end="121.59">things that we noticed once we once we</span> <span data-start="121.59" data-end="122.85">pulled all this like service</span> <span data-start="122.85" data-end="124.649">orchestration and aggregation out of our</span> <span data-start="124.649" data-end="126.689">client-side applications and gave it</span> <span data-start="126.689" data-end="128.52">like a real home that was dedicated to</span> <span data-start="128.52" data-end="130.709">it there were a few things that we</span> <span data-start="130.709" data-end="131.97">noticed that we weren't expecting</span> <span data-start="131.97" data-end="133.53">initially</span> <span data-start="133.53" data-end="134.94">so I picked a couple of those and</span> <span data-start="134.94" data-end="136.23">there's a ton of things you could talk</span> <span data-start="136.23" data-end="137.55">about but I picked a couple that I'm</span> <span data-start="137.55" data-end="139.5">hoping will be we be useful for some</span> <span data-start="139.5" data-end="144.06">people here to share those with you you</span> <span data-start="144.06" data-end="145.709">know aside from the inherit benefits</span> <span data-start="145.709" data-end="147.51">that you get from like pulling all of</span> <span data-start="147.51" data-end="150.75">that logic to to sort of normalize that</span> <span data-start="150.75" data-end="152.43">service communication out of your UI</span> <span data-start="152.43" data-end="154.59">they're really sees these things that we</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="154.59" data-end="156.18">I think you could have a whole talk just</span> <span data-start="156.18" data-end="157.89">on that about like how pulling that out</span> <span data-start="157.89" data-end="159.72">of your front end application and doing</span> <span data-start="159.72" data-end="161.58">it somewhere else has all these benefits</span> <span data-start="161.58" data-end="163.41">for you you I but that'd be a completely</span> <span data-start="163.41" data-end="165.87">different talk so I want to talk a</span> <span data-start="165.87" data-end="167.25">little bit about some of the benefits</span> <span data-start="167.25" data-end="172.95">that we saw so so when we build when we</span> <span data-start="172.95" data-end="175.56">build a lot of our applications you know</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="175.56" data-end="177.45">Yahoo's been around for a while so we're</span> <span data-start="177.45" data-end="180.269">building on on some existing services so</span> <span data-start="180.269" data-end="181.86">wanna see you buy a raise of hands how</span> <span data-start="181.86" data-end="183.3">many people out there have built like an</span> <span data-start="183.3" data-end="185.73">application a website something where</span> <span data-start="185.73" data-end="187.95">they got to build it on top of like</span> <span data-start="187.95" data-end="189.569">pristine services basically from the</span> <span data-start="189.569" data-end="192.209">ground up like they had no baggage no</span> <span data-start="192.209" data-end="195.12">legacy anything all right so you got</span> <span data-start="195.12" data-end="198.11">like maybe a quarter of the people here</span> <span data-start="198.11" data-end="200.459">and then how many people have had the</span> <span data-start="200.459" data-end="202.049">opposite where they built an application</span> <span data-start="202.049" data-end="203.76">website something and I've had to</span> <span data-start="203.76" data-end="205.32">interact with at least like one legacy</span> <span data-start="205.32" data-end="209.549">system it looks like about everybody and</span> <span data-start="209.549" data-end="212.61">that's kind of the the reality of</span> <span data-start="212.61" data-end="215.7">working for any any established company</span> <span data-start="215.7" data-end="217.59">or company that has been around for a</span> <span data-start="217.59" data-end="219.75">little while you're going to have to</span> <span data-start="219.75" data-end="221.28">interact with some legacy services</span> <span data-start="221.28" data-end="225.45">probably so I got a story so we were</span> <span data-start="225.45" data-end="228.359">working on this one this piece of our</span> <span data-start="228.359" data-end="230.489">application this new UI where we have</span> <span data-start="230.489" data-end="233.91">this this concept or this thing that a</span> <span data-start="233.91" data-end="235.739">user needed to interact with they needed</span> <span data-start="235.739" data-end="242.64">to create this thing and and so so we're</span> <span data-start="242.64" data-end="243.69">coming up with like what's the UI</span> <span data-start="243.69" data-end="245.07">supposed to look with look like for that</span> <span data-start="245.07" data-end="246.84">and it was like dead simples like we</span> <span data-start="246.84" data-end="248.4">need to collect one piece of info for</span> <span data-start="248.4" data-end="250.92">the user to create this thing so like</span> <span data-start="250.92" data-end="252.299">that was settled we knew what the you I</span> <span data-start="252.299" data-end="254.04">was supposed to look like we had to</span> <span data-start="254.04" data-end="255.87">prompt the user for this thing and we</span> <span data-start="255.87" data-end="258.15">started interacting with with a team</span> <span data-start="258.15" data-end="260.519">that was was handling these services for</span> <span data-start="260.519" data-end="263.43">us for this particular this particular</span> <span data-start="263.43" data-end="266.159">data structure that we needed to somehow</span> <span data-start="266.159" data-end="267.32">persist</span> <span data-start="267.32" data-end="269.64">so we talked with them and explain what</span> <span data-start="269.64" data-end="271.23">it is that we need it and they came back</span> <span data-start="271.23" data-end="272.79">said yeah we got something for that will</span> <span data-start="272.79" data-end="275.07">let me send you the schema for that so</span> <span data-start="275.07" data-end="277.25">they sent us this thing and we're like</span> <span data-start="277.25" data-end="281.52">really like this thing there's like 30</span> <span data-start="281.52" data-end="283.02">fields in it or something we only need</span> <span data-start="283.02" data-end="284.22">like one of them and they're like well</span> <span data-start="284.22" data-end="285.9">this is how you have to persist this</span> <span data-start="285.9" data-end="288.72">thing because of things like you have to</span> <span data-start="288.72" data-end="291.99">save it this way I'm I'm taking some</span> <span data-start="291.99" data-end="294.39">creative liberties a little bit with the</span> <span data-start="294.39" data-end="298.17">story but but the gist of it was like we</span> <span data-start="298.17" data-end="300.18">had a very simple thing that we needed</span> <span data-start="300.18" data-end="303.33">we needed from a UI perspective and all</span> <span data-start="303.33" data-end="305.07">son got like very complicated once we</span> <span data-start="305.07" data-end="307.67">needed to interact with these services</span> <span data-start="307.67" data-end="311.88">so so we were thinking like you know</span> <span data-start="311.88" data-end="313.35">there's a lot of ways to handle that you</span> <span data-start="313.35" data-end="316.44">can build like a very simple sort of</span> <span data-start="316.44" data-end="318.63">mapping layer in your UI to try and</span> <span data-start="318.63" data-end="320.25">create an abstraction it makes sense for</span> <span data-start="320.25" data-end="322.8">the UI but then converts it to something</span> <span data-start="322.8" data-end="324.51">like this or whatever it is that you</span> <span data-start="324.51" data-end="328.05">need when you when you talk to that</span> <span data-start="328.05" data-end="329.82">service initially that's sort of a path</span> <span data-start="329.82" data-end="333.69">that we took but like as we had that</span> <span data-start="333.69" data-end="335.25">like that mapping layer or that</span> <span data-start="335.25" data-end="336.9">abstraction we were trying to do it in</span> <span data-start="336.9" data-end="338.97">the UI like it just feels fake because</span> <span data-start="338.97" data-end="341.55">it's like right there next to it it</span> <span data-start="341.55" data-end="344.1">didn't feel like like it was a real</span> <span data-start="344.1" data-end="348.419">abstraction and and I as we got into it</span> <span data-start="348.419" data-end="350.07">it actually ended up being that we had</span> <span data-start="350.07" data-end="352.89">like two different UI concepts that both</span> <span data-start="352.89" data-end="354.84">like needed to be persisted in the same</span> <span data-start="354.84" data-end="356.19">data structure in slightly different</span> <span data-start="356.19" data-end="362.25">ways so that that's where like we found</span> <span data-start="362.25" data-end="365.31">we found this benefit of like creating</span> <span data-start="365.31" data-end="366.87">these tailor-fit abstractions for our</span> <span data-start="366.87" data-end="369.18">you is so in one case like we had two</span> <span data-start="369.18" data-end="371.57">different data structures for our you is</span> <span data-start="371.57" data-end="374.49">that that were like exactly what we</span> <span data-start="374.49" data-end="378.96">needed for the UI no more no less and</span> <span data-start="378.96" data-end="380.97">and creating those you know those</span> <span data-start="380.97" data-end="382.77">abstractions and putting them in this</span> <span data-start="382.77" data-end="385.86">middle tier it had an interesting effect</span> <span data-start="385.86" data-end="387.9">because like as soon as you have like a</span> <span data-start="387.9" data-end="390.84">set of dedicated routes to something you</span> <span data-start="390.84" data-end="393.15">know an actual model that represents it</span> <span data-start="393.15" data-end="396.18">so a set of these resources dedicated to</span> <span data-start="396.18" data-end="397.95">the subtraction like it becomes more</span> <span data-start="397.95" data-end="399.74">real for some reason</span> <span data-start="399.74" data-end="401.509">and the you I can treat it that way and</span> <span data-start="401.509" data-end="403.16">it's not it's you know it's it's a it's</span> <span data-start="403.16" data-end="406.24">a lot harder to sort of budget and just</span> <span data-start="406.24" data-end="408.949">you know let the abstraction leak into</span> <span data-start="408.949" data-end="410.93">what that big huge thing was that that</span> <span data-start="410.93" data-end="412.52">you really want to kind of hide from</span> <span data-start="412.52" data-end="415.729">your UI so but that doesn't come without</span> <span data-start="415.729" data-end="417.5">overhead like as you create you know you</span> <span data-start="417.5" data-end="418.729">want to create all these abstractions</span> <span data-start="418.729" data-end="420.49">that are tailored fit for your UI</span> <span data-start="420.49" data-end="423.02">there's overhead of like creating routes</span> <span data-start="423.02" data-end="425.36">and then having to maintain those you</span> <span data-start="425.36" data-end="426.53">know you want to make sure that they're</span> <span data-start="426.53" data-end="428.569">validated correctly and I think that's</span> <span data-start="428.569" data-end="430.28">where like some of the stuff that's been</span> <span data-start="430.28" data-end="432.47">talked about earlier that Regis talked</span> <span data-start="432.47" data-end="434.24">down with joy like it makes it really</span> <span data-start="434.24" data-end="436.069">easy and cheap to do a lot of that stuff</span> <span data-start="436.069" data-end="438.53">you can even at the end of each stock</span> <span data-start="438.53" data-end="441.02">had talked about sharing schemas you can</span> <span data-start="441.02" data-end="442.669">share schema so you avoid some of that</span> <span data-start="442.669" data-end="445.19">duplication some of that overhead to</span> <span data-start="445.19" data-end="447.889">maintaining that stuff so that was one</span> <span data-start="447.889" data-end="449.569">thing that we did that we found was</span> <span data-start="449.569" data-end="450.83">really helpful that we weren't really</span> <span data-start="450.83" data-end="452.72">anticipating that once we created this</span> <span data-start="452.72" data-end="454.759">dedicated middle tier we'd have a place</span> <span data-start="454.759" data-end="456.83">to create these abstractions that you</span> <span data-start="456.83" data-end="458.63">know didn't necessarily exist in some of</span> <span data-start="458.63" data-end="460.909">the services we were calling but but</span> <span data-start="460.909" data-end="462.56">they became feasible for our front end</span> <span data-start="462.56" data-end="464.75">and that had some great great side</span> <span data-start="464.75" data-end="470.389">effects the other thing that we thought</span> <span data-start="470.389" data-end="474.979">we noticed so as we were like building</span> <span data-start="474.979" data-end="476.93">up these these applications and talking</span> <span data-start="476.93" data-end="479.659">to different services like not all</span> <span data-start="479.659" data-end="482.09">services are created equal like some of</span> <span data-start="482.09" data-end="485.18">them some of them you know use status</span> <span data-start="485.18" data-end="487.13">codes for for how you can detect whether</span> <span data-start="487.13" data-end="488.539">there was an error whether it did what</span> <span data-start="488.539" data-end="490.669">you wanted it to do some of them send</span> <span data-start="490.669" data-end="492.53">you JSON and it's like you know in a</span> <span data-start="492.53" data-end="493.94">great format that you can look at some</span> <span data-start="493.94" data-end="495.74">property some of them send you some</span> <span data-start="495.74" data-end="497.509">string that maybe you have to like match</span> <span data-start="497.509" data-end="499.55">patterns against and some of them</span> <span data-start="499.55" data-end="500.96">sometimes send you nothing and that</span> <span data-start="500.96" data-end="502.819">means it worked or sometimes they send</span> <span data-start="502.819" data-end="504.229">you nothing for a different route that</span> <span data-start="504.229" data-end="506.419">means it didn't work and these are all</span> <span data-start="506.419" data-end="508.849">examples of like something that we have</span> <span data-start="508.849" data-end="510.59">right now any services that we've talked</span> <span data-start="510.59" data-end="513.94">with that that we've had to go through</span> <span data-start="513.94" data-end="517.219">so you know for your UI like if you have</span> <span data-start="517.219" data-end="519.169">to normalize all that in the UI it's not</span> <span data-start="519.169" data-end="521.27">only like extra code but it's like it</span> <span data-start="521.27" data-end="522.529">just becomes a mess and you have to</span> <span data-start="522.529" data-end="525.92">maintain it it becomes very buggy so so</span> <span data-start="525.92" data-end="527.57">it's an obvious thing to move to this</span> <span data-start="527.57" data-end="530.089">middle tier and to normalize all those</span> <span data-start="530.089" data-end="531.949">crazy services so you have like one</span> <span data-start="531.949" data-end="533.51">consistent output</span> <span data-start="533.51" data-end="544.9">or for you you I oops went too far so</span> <span data-start="544.9" data-end="547.82">and happy has modules that make that</span> <span data-start="547.82" data-end="549.56">really easy that you know we've talked</span> <span data-start="549.56" data-end="551.45">about or I don't know if booms been</span> <span data-start="551.45" data-end="553.73">mentioned but boom like I used to hate</span> <span data-start="553.73" data-end="555.47">status codes and I built api's in the</span> <span data-start="555.47" data-end="558.44">past in the past and I always hated like</span> <span data-start="558.44" data-end="560.45">trying to figure out which I wish status</span> <span data-start="560.45" data-end="561.77">code am I supposed to use how can I make</span> <span data-start="561.77" data-end="563.36">sure that like everybody is returning</span> <span data-start="563.36" data-end="564.86">the right status code at the right time</span> <span data-start="564.86" data-end="567.58">that were consistent across our API and</span> <span data-start="567.58" data-end="570.95">boom makes that pretty easy like in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="570.95" data-end="572.87">English that people can understand when</span> <span data-start="572.87" data-end="574.43">you're doing code reviews is pretty</span> <span data-start="574.43" data-end="576.44">obvious like whether it's doing the</span> <span data-start="576.44" data-end="579.44">right thing there but we had like we had</span> <span data-start="579.44" data-end="581.09">these existing front end applications</span> <span data-start="581.09" data-end="582.8">that were expecting a certain payload</span> <span data-start="582.8" data-end="585.77">structure of Jason does anyone heard of</span> <span data-start="585.77" data-end="590.27">Jace and not a lot of people just me all</span> <span data-start="590.27" data-end="592.19">right there's not a whole lot to it it's</span> <span data-start="592.19" data-end="595.16">just like a JSON structure that's a</span> <span data-start="595.16" data-end="597.14">convention for how to send messages back</span> <span data-start="597.14" data-end="599.27">and forth with certain properties so we</span> <span data-start="599.27" data-end="600.74">had these you is that were already built</span> <span data-start="600.74" data-end="603.01">and sort of anticipating that structure</span> <span data-start="603.01" data-end="606.08">so it was really easy to just tap into</span> <span data-start="606.08" data-end="608.51">the hooks too happy provides with angry</span> <span data-start="608.51" data-end="612.11">use the on pre response hook to take</span> <span data-start="612.11" data-end="614">whatever that structure was and then</span> <span data-start="614" data-end="616.58">take like a boom response and then</span> <span data-start="616.58" data-end="618.44">convert it into something that that was</span> <span data-start="618.44" data-end="620.45">what our you eyes were expecting which</span> <span data-start="620.45" data-end="625.58">was this thing and you know did</span> <span data-start="625.58" data-end="627.44">converting like these four hundred</span> <span data-start="627.44" data-end="629.81">errors into into failures and 500 into</span> <span data-start="629.81" data-end="632.51">22 errors and then leaving some</span> <span data-start="632.51" data-end="633.65">additional properties that we didn't</span> <span data-start="633.65" data-end="636.55">have before that were helpful but not</span> <span data-start="636.55" data-end="638.66">that I think that'll be super helpful</span> <span data-start="638.66" data-end="640.28">for anyone else if you are using James</span> <span data-start="640.28" data-end="642.14">send which it sounds like nobody else is</span> <span data-start="642.14" data-end="645.17">out here it could be helpful but it just</span> <span data-start="645.17" data-end="647.3">for me was it was nice to see how easy</span> <span data-start="647.3" data-end="648.71">it was it just happened to that hook</span> <span data-start="648.71" data-end="650.84">well inspect the response we're getting</span> <span data-start="650.84" data-end="652.88">back it was really easy to see if it was</span> <span data-start="652.88" data-end="654.41">an error because I was like in is boom</span> <span data-start="654.41" data-end="657.23">property and then handle it accordingly</span> <span data-start="657.23" data-end="659.09">and convert it into what our you guys</span> <span data-start="659.09" data-end="662.45">were expecting and it's something that</span> <span data-start="662.45" data-end="664.16">if we migrate and change our you eyes</span> <span data-start="664.16" data-end="665.6">like it's really easy to pull that out</span> <span data-start="665.6" data-end="667.31">and just leave stuff as as</span> <span data-start="667.31" data-end="669.32">sort of with vanilla boomers and their</span> <span data-start="669.32" data-end="673.22">responses so more than anything what</span> <span data-start="673.22" data-end="675.65">what I'm hoping you get out of this if</span> <span data-start="675.65" data-end="677.18">you got something out of this other than</span> <span data-start="677.18" data-end="679.61">the ten-minute nap is that you'll</span> <span data-start="679.61" data-end="681.77">consider like this middle tier of your</span> <span data-start="681.77" data-end="683.57">application and like that doesn't</span> <span data-start="683.57" data-end="686.24">necessarily mean you have an actual like</span> <span data-start="686.24" data-end="688.67">dedicated layer or dedicated service</span> <span data-start="688.67" data-end="690.26">like that middle tier if you're talking</span> <span data-start="690.26" data-end="692.39">with services is probably somewhere and</span> <span data-start="692.39" data-end="694.25">it might even be in your UI code it</span> <span data-start="694.25" data-end="696.35">might be through like your UI code to</span> <span data-start="696.35" data-end="698.33">your node server for your front end like</span> <span data-start="698.33" data-end="700.31">sprinkle through several places but</span> <span data-start="700.31" data-end="702.35">consider that and if it's becoming like</span> <span data-start="702.35" data-end="705.38">hard to consume and manage like try to</span> <span data-start="705.38" data-end="706.94">try you know think of some of these</span> <span data-start="706.94" data-end="709.04">things and consider moving it to a</span> <span data-start="709.04" data-end="711.05">dedicated middle tier one of the things</span> <span data-start="711.05" data-end="713.12">that we found really helpful for I guess</span> <span data-start="713.12" data-end="715.76">we hired new engineers when it was all</span> <span data-start="715.76" data-end="717.529">in one application where is this one UI</span> <span data-start="717.529" data-end="719.93">that was like you know all the UI code</span> <span data-start="719.93" data-end="721.52">the front-end code also talking to all</span> <span data-start="721.52" data-end="723.2">the services it was a lot to bite off</span> <span data-start="723.2" data-end="726.2">and consume and sort of grok for for new</span> <span data-start="726.2" data-end="728.12">hires but when you could like break that</span> <span data-start="728.12" data-end="730.16">out into its own layer and then let</span> <span data-start="730.16" data-end="731.9">people ease into it as they were</span> <span data-start="731.9" data-end="733.88">starting to get everything became a lot</span> <span data-start="733.88" data-end="736.49">easier to maintain so give your your</span> <span data-start="736.49" data-end="737.81">middle tier the attention that it</span> <span data-start="737.81" data-end="740.45">deserves it's probably somewhere in your</span> <span data-start="740.45" data-end="742.61">application already so look for ways</span> <span data-start="742.61" data-end="743.78">that you can use some of these tools</span> <span data-start="743.78" data-end="746.39">that the happy ecosystem provides to try</span> <span data-start="746.39" data-end="747.89">and give it that attention the desserts</span> <span data-start="747.89" data-end="750.02">make it something beautiful like that</span> <span data-start="750.02" data-end="753.17">that you can manage and just eat it and</span> <span data-start="753.17" data-end="756.17">enjoy it one of the things that I really</span> <span data-start="756.17" data-end="757.82">appreciate about happy is like the</span> <span data-start="757.82" data-end="761.45">effort that let's put in to making it</span> <span data-start="761.45" data-end="763.85">very modular it's not just one library</span> <span data-start="763.85" data-end="767.42">it's it's a series of libraries that you</span> <span data-start="767.42" data-end="769.37">know like reads that you might use joy</span> <span data-start="769.37" data-end="770.72">for something that has nothing to do</span> <span data-start="770.72" data-end="772.79">with HTTP so it's great that there's</span> <span data-start="772.79" data-end="775.1">these these suite of tools that are like</span> <span data-start="775.1" data-end="779.3">heavily tested and sort of proven that</span> <span data-start="779.3" data-end="780.95">the end they work well together but you</span> <span data-start="780.95" data-end="782.15">don't necessarily have to use them</span> <span data-start="782.15" data-end="783.83">together so as you sort of give your</span> <span data-start="783.83" data-end="784.88">middle tier the attention it deserves</span> <span data-start="784.88" data-end="786.86">like some of the tools that happier</span> <span data-start="786.86" data-end="788.87">provides whether you use happy like as</span> <span data-start="788.87" data-end="790.94">an HTTP server or not there's probably</span> <span data-start="790.94" data-end="792.589">something in that ecosystem that will be</span> <span data-start="792.589" data-end="795.08">a benefit to you and then there's some</span> <span data-start="795.08" data-end="796.91">cats and warm fuzzies because everybody</span> <span data-start="796.91" data-end="798.35">likes cats i'm not really a cat person</span> <span data-start="798.35" data-end="800">but i thought if i showed cats you guys</span> <span data-start="800" data-end="801.02">would like my talk</span> <span data-start="801.02" data-end="804.5">and like
