you can do with react so you can you</span> <span data-start="652.11" data-end="654.09">can throw away the runtime type checking</span> <span data-start="654.09" data-end="657.3">in favor of static type checking here</span> <span data-start="657.3" data-end="659.55">you can see a coffee image component</span> <span data-start="659.55" data-end="663">which only has one prop its format and</span> <span data-start="663" data-end="665.02">it can either be P&G or J</span> <span data-start="665.02" data-end="670.36">back so if we start to use the coffee in</span> <span data-start="670.36" data-end="674.71">it's in our application and we pass it a</span> <span data-start="674.71" data-end="677.94">format and if we give it something else</span> <span data-start="677.94" data-end="683.19">like a gif will get an inline error and</span> <span data-start="683.19" data-end="685.78">the error says that this string isn't in</span> <span data-start="685.78" data-end="688.6">the string item that you told me the</span> <span data-start="688.6" data-end="692.25">format is so this can be really useful</span> <span data-start="692.25" data-end="694.96">just for completeness sake we could have</span> <span data-start="694.96" data-end="696.55">implemented coffee images to save this</span> <span data-start="696.55" data-end="698.08">component and flow and support for that</span> <span data-start="698.08" data-end="707.37">as well so what can't do this section is</span> <span data-start="707.37" data-end="712.6">pretty short and pretty specific it</span> <span data-start="712.6" data-end="714.94">can't warn about additional properties</span> <span data-start="714.94" data-end="719.5">declared on a components prop type this</span> <span data-start="719.5" data-end="720.76">is an example of what I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="720.76" data-end="722.86">we have a hallow component which is only</span> <span

data-end="739.35">probably be improved in the near future</span> <span data-start="739.35" data-end="741.76">the root cause of this is that flow</span> <span data-start="741.76" data-end="744.31">doesn't really support exact object I'm</span> <span data-start="744.31" data-end="746.77">kind of going to skip this slide but I</span> <span data-start="746.77" data-end="749.26">want it in the slide deck so you can</span> <span data-start="749.26" data-end="754.33">look at it later if you want to another</span> <span data-start="754.33" data-end="756.25">thing that is problematic with flow are</span> <span data-start="756.25" data-end="758.47">non-native data structures and what I</span> <span data-start="758.47" data-end="760.18">mean by non-native data structures are</span> <span data-start="760.18" data-end="762.37">their searches that don't behave like</span> <span data-start="762.37" data-end="765.25">normal JavaScript native data structures</span> <span data-start="765.25" data-end="769.06">like array and object for example we're</span> <span data-start="769.06" data-end="771.25">using immutable J's a lot and it's</span> <span data-start="771.25" data-end="773.53">really difficult to model mutable data</span> <span data-start="773.53" data-end="775.99">structures and flow I think it's mainly</span> <span data-start="775.99" data-end="778.36">because of how the API is constructed if</span> <span data-start="778.36" data-end="779.92">you're going to access a property deep</span> <span data-start="779.92" data-end="782.02">down in our object you have to give it a</span> <span data-start="782.02" data-end="783.91">key path which is an array of strings</span> <span data-start="783.91" data-end="788.41">it's really hard to model that but the</span> <span data-start="788.41" data-end="790.69">good news is that in a recent QA the</span> <span data-start="790.69" data-end="792.64">fluid flow team revealed that better</span> <span data-start="792.64" data-end="797.49">support for immutability is in the works</span> <span data-start="797.5" data-end="799.81">again I'm kind of going to skip this</span> <span data-start="799.81"
