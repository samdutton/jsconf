<p><span data-start="61.649" data-end="64.08">JavaScript file and this way which helps</span> <span data-start="64.08" data-end="65.519">the browser to okay download download</span> <span

about this is that</span> <span data-start="83.97" data-end="86.07">it's 100% backwards compatible so for</span> <span data-start="86.07" data-end="88.799">browsers that do not support the

data-start="93.78" data-end="98.49">used to be so now that we've made pages</span> <span data-start="98.49" data-end="101.009">a little bit more secure let's make them</span> <span data-start="101.009" data-end="105.27">a little bit faster too and this is how</span> <span data-start="105.27" data-end="107.07">to really really really really catch a</span> <span data-start="107.07" data-end="110.369">cache effort so you might think that</span> <span data-start="110.369" data-end="112.47">once you have a Mac a cache control</span> <span data-start="112.47" data-end="114.689">max-age header which is maybe for a year</span> <span data-start="114.689" data-end="118.259">that the browser will always serve that</span> <span data-start="118.259" data-end="121.829">file out of the cache until the cache</span> <span data-start="121.829" data-end="124.439">expires and I just important that this</span> <span data-start="124.439" data-end="126.299">is not true by default and what will</span> <span data-start="126.299" data-end="129.69">also show a way how to actually achieve</span> <span data-start="129.69" data-end="132.819">this and I want to do this by an example</span> <span data-start="132.819" data-end="137.049">our little web page with a bunch of the</span> <span data-start="137.049" data-end="139.62">middle let's pretend it's 40 maybe 50</span> <span data-start="139.62" data-end="142.239">and those are your measures and you are</span> <span data-start="142.239" data-end="143.319">pretty sure that they will never change</span> <span data-start="143.319" data-end="145.389">on the LEDs not in a year and if they</span> <span data-start="145.389" data-end="147.31">change you can just change ul and then</span> <span data-start="147.31" data-end="149.139">basketball castle which is more safe</span> <span data-start="149.139" data-end="154.569">anyway and I would like to to go through</span> <span data-start="154.569" data-end="156.519">what actually happens if the browser we</span> <span data-start="156.519" data-end="158.56">pressed in one of those images for the</span> <span data-start="158.56" data-end="160">first time and then for the second time</span> <span data-start="160" data-end="164.319">and then explain the problem so what</span> <span data-start="164.319" data-end="165.879">happens is the browser requests the</span> <span data-start="165.879" data-end="167.829">image and your server will basically</span> <span data-start="167.829" data-end="170.62">answer will to run it okay because the</span> <span data-start="170.62" data-end="172.09">image is found and fine</span> <span data-start="172.09" data-end="173.65">then there's the image content of course</span> <span data-start="173.65" data-end="175.389">but there are headers in between and the</span> <span data-start="175.389" data-end="177.219">for example cache control header with</span> <span data-start="177.219" data-end="179.469">the next page those this is one year and</span> <span data-start="179.469" data-end="183.01">second and an e-check which is the</span> <span data-start="183.01" data-end="185.829">content hash of the image and then the</span> <span data-start="185.829" data-end="188.26">browser will will cache this image in</span> <span data-start="188.26" data-end="191.5">the cache stored in the cache and then</span> <span data-start="191.5" data-end="193.54">whenever you navigate through the page</span> <span data-start="193.54" data-end="197.169">will will liberate from a cache but when</span> <span data-start="197.169" data-end="199.269">you do a reload which actually happens</span> <span data-start="199.269" data-end="200.769">more often than you might think</span> <span data-start="200.769" data-end="204.25">then it won't serve it directly from the</span> <span data-start="204.25" data-end="209.079">cache but will initiate a request in</span> <span data-start="209.079" data-end="211.75">your server although you specify before</span> <span data-start="211.75" data-end="214.09">that the image will be fine for you it's</span> <span data-start="214.09" data-end="217.18">a so called conditional request and the</span> <span data-start="217.18" data-end="220.109">browser will adder is non-match tag</span> <span data-start="220.109" data-end="224.109">header in this case with the with the</span> <span data-start="224.109" data-end="226.509">hash key tag you have provided before</span> <span data-start="226.509" data-end="227.979">and will basically ask your back-end</span> <span data-start="227.979" data-end="231.069">server is the image it's still still</span> <span data-start="231.069" data-end="233.68">matches this hash and this is the case</span> <span data-start="233.68" data-end="235.509">because you are sure that this will be</span> <span data-start="235.509" data-end="236.739">the case for the next year and therefore</span> <span data-start="236.739" data-end="240.04">the browser answers with a we owe for</span> <span data-start="240.04" data-end="244.84">not modified response omitting the</span> <span data-start="244.84" data-end="246.669">header omitting the body so there the</span> <span data-start="246.669" data-end="248.859">body has not to be transferred again but</span> <span data-start="248.859" data-end="250.78">you still have to make the request with</span> <span data-start="250.78" data-end="252.699">a lot of agency and if you have 40</span> <span data-start="252.699" data-end="255.43">images this is done for 40 images and if</span> <span data-start="255.43" data-end="256.78">you are talking about a scale like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="256.78" data-end="259.84">Facebook then this will result into</span> <span data-start="259.84" data-end="262.66">millions and millions of unnecessary</span> <span data-start="262.66" data-end="268.12">and Mozilla pioneered something that is</span> <span data-start="268.12" data-end="270.04">going to fix this which is called</span> <span data-start="270.04" data-end="272.47">cache-control immutable and with</span> <span data-start="272.47" data-end="275.62">cache-control immutable which is a HTTP</span> <span data-start="275.62" data-end="279.55">header you can tell the browser to like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="279.55" data-end="281.44">I am really really sure that this image</span> <span data-start="281.44" data-end="283.39">will not change in the year and this is</span> <span data-start="283.39" data-end="285.85">how the request then looks like for the</span> <span data-start="285.85" data-end="288.46">first request to the image again we get</span> <span data-start="288.46" data-end="290.23">requests and you will receive the image</span> <span data-start="290.23" data-end="292.06">content again but this time the cache</span> <span data-start="292.06" data-end="295.12">control in addition to the max H also</span> <span data-start="295.12" data-end="297.73">has an immutable flag and when the</span> <span data-start="297.73" data-end="300.07">browser or user refreshes the page the</span> <span data-start="300.07" data-end="301.03">next time then</span> <span data-start="301.03" data-end="303.16">the browser will simply observe it from</span> <span data-start="303.16" data-end="305.68">its cache and not ask you move ever</span> <span data-start="305.68" data-end="307.87">again at least for this year and I guess</span> <span data-start="307.87" data-end="310.03">this is pretty cool the issue is now if</span> <span data-start="310.03" data-end="312.16">you if you if you go to Chrome and want</span> <span data-start="312.16" data-end="313.99">to try this then you won't have you will</span> <span data-start="313.99" data-end="315.49">have a bad time because they were asked</span> <span data-start="315.49" data-end="317.41">to implement this as well and then they</span> <span data-start="317.41" data-end="320.47">just almost switches the entire</span> <span data-start="320.47" data-end="322.6">condition to accept and you don't need</span> <span data-start="322.6" data-end="325.03">be headed there it just works out of the</span> <span data-start="325.03" data-end="331.12">box map which is cool as well so now we</span> <span data-start="331.12" data-end="333.01">improve caching a bit but no matter how</span> <span data-start="333.01" data-end="334.63">good your caching might be there's</span> <span data-start="334.63" data-end="336.7">always the first unfished</span> <span data-start="336.7" data-end="338.74">request to be made to a website and this</span> <span data-start="338.74" data-end="340.41">is why I would like to talk about</span> <span data-start="340.41" data-end="344.43">results in and especially the preload</span> <span data-start="344.43" data-end="348.73">resources my example is a such totally</span> <span data-start="348.73" data-end="351.46">awesome website which is a blog post</span> <span data-start="351.46" data-end="354.669">about dancing pedestrians and with a</span> <span data-start="354.669" data-end="356.86">with a large viewer image which which</span> <span data-start="356.86" data-end="358.33">icons which I would consider pretty</span> <span data-start="358.33" data-end="362.26">important for this page so yeah this is</span> <span data-start="362.26" data-end="364.3">how it looks like this is maybe how we</span> <span data-start="364.3" data-end="366.36">had stuff like so there's a stylesheet</span> <span data-start="366.36" data-end="369.49">precisely this and a bunch of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="369.49" data-end="373.96">files nothing too uncommon I'd say this</span> <span data-start="373.96" data-end="375.97">is Caesar so there's only background</span> <span data-start="375.97" data-end="377.98">image for yes the dancing finish you</span> <span data-start="377.98" data-end="381.16">intimate the issue is what when the</span> <span data-start="381.16" data-end="382.96">users on a slow Network this is how it</span> <span data-start="382.96" data-end="386.98">probably will look like when they open</span> <span data-start="386.98" data-end="391.21">the page so going to wait for image it's</span> <span data-start="391.21" data-end="392.53">going to take a while until it appears</span> <span data-start="392.53" data-end="394.12">on this tax in this case because the</span> <span data-start="394.12" data-end="396.1">image is super super important</span> <span data-start="396.1" data-end="398.08">and you can also see them in this</span> <span data-start="398.08" data-end="401.08">waterfall graphic options and yes that</span> <span data-start="401.08" data-end="403.33">the image is the last item and it is</span> <span data-start="403.33" data-end="405.25">only downloaded after all these scripts</span> <span data-start="405.25" data-end="408.85">and and the see is that and this is</span> <span data-start="408.85" data-end="411.97">because in if you specify a background</span> <span data-start="411.97" data-end="414.79">image and CSS it won't be it will only</span> <span data-start="414.79" data-end="416.08">be downloaded different selector</span> <span data-start="416.08" data-end="418.15">measures and the browser can only know</span> <span data-start="418.15" data-end="419.71">if these selector matches if it has</span> <span data-start="419.71" data-end="422.47">downloaded and parsed the disease that's</span> <span data-start="422.47" data-end="423.85">entirely and also there's rip</span> <span data-start="423.85" data-end="425.98">synchronous quits let's follow it so</span> <span data-start="425.98" data-end="428.47">this is why the image download starts at</span> <span data-start="428.47" data-end="433.21">the very very end what you can do is you</span> <span data-start="433.21" data-end="436.36">can add a link tag to your have in the</span> <span data-start="436.36" data-end="438.91">state the bucket a sheet with relation</span> <span data-start="438.91" data-end="442.39">cetera preload and the atria is your</span> <span data-start="442.39" data-end="444.19">background image and this tells the</span> <span data-start="444.19" data-end="447.97">browser that you want this this asset to</span> <span data-start="447.97" data-end="451.24">be downloaded as fast as possibly as</span> <span data-start="451.24" data-end="454.3">fast as it can and so you don't need to</span> <span data-start="454.3" data-end="457.23">wait until it finds it into InDesign and</span> <span data-start="457.23" data-end="460.57">the resulting water shot what a full</span> <span data-start="460.57" data-end="462.82">chart looks like this so the background</span> <span data-start="462.82" data-end="465.85">image is now downloaded in parallel with</span> <span data-start="465.85" data-end="468.19">all the other assets and we will get</span> <span data-start="468.19" data-end="470.95">much much earlier and before and you can</span> <span data-start="470.95" data-end="472.57">use it for for other things as well for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472.57" data-end="474.1">JavaScript that you will load as</span> <span data-start="474.1" data-end="477.82">inclusive or use for I think this keys</span> <span data-start="477.82"

data-end="484.84">want those you there's actually a way to</span> <span data-start="484.84" data-end="486.88">tell the browser even earlier about</span> <span data-start="486.88" data-end="489.7">resources that you might need</span> <span data-start="489.7" data-end="493.02">enter early hint so this one is a</span> <span data-start="493.02" data-end="495.37">request for

to</span> <span data-start="499.42" data-end="503.26">mention it anyway but before I will dive</span> <span data-start="503.26" data-end="506.11">into that there's one thing I'd like to</span> <span data-start="506.11" data-end="509.35">emphasize that is that an HTTP one</span> <span data-start="509.35" data-end="512.229">request doesn't necessarily result in</span> <span data-start="512.229" data-end="515.38">only one response and the spec states a</span> <span data-start="515.38" data-end="517.36">client must be Pichette prepare to</span> <span data-start="517.36"

data-end="555.11">cookie information and the content</span> <span data-start="555.11" data-end="557.389">length or that the video will have a but</span> <span data-start="557.389" data-end="559.279">not sent the body right away and then</span> <span data-start="559.279" data-end="561.8">also the expect 100 continue header</span> <span data-start="561.8" data-end="563.629">which basically tells the server that</span> <span data-start="563.629" data-end="566.059">you will not send the video right away</span> <span data-start="566.059" data-end="570.8">but expect its response so and if then</span> <span data-start="570.8" data-end="572.209">the solar check if you'll still log in</span> <span data-start="572.209" data-end="573.92">and allows you a video and if that's the</span> <span data-start="573.92" data-end="576.47">case will enter with 100 and only then</span> <span data-start="576.47" data-end="578.899">you will go on uploading the video which</span> <span data-start="578.899" data-end="581.449">will then result in an HTTP code of 200</span> <span data-start="581.449" data-end="584.589">or 201 depending on the implementation</span> <span data-start="584.589" data-end="590.629">or something 400 if it fails this and</span> <span data-start="590.629" data-end="593.629">this same mechanism is used in the 103</span> <span data-start="593.629" data-end="594.23">early hand</span> <span data-start="594.23" data-end="597.23">so when you make the request to the</span> <span data-start="597.23" data-end="598.97">server then the backend server can</span> <span data-start="598.97" data-end="602.86">generate your HTML by talking to API or</span> <span data-start="602.86" data-end="605.899">make it or contacting the database for</span> <span data-start="605.899" data-end="608.629">information but while the server is</span> <span data-start="608.629" data-end="611.209">added the web server can already give</span> <span data-start="611.209" data-end="612.74">you the response with the resources that</span> <span data-start="612.74" data-end="614.48">you will need once the pages done</span> <span data-start="614.48" data-end="616.91">generated a window that you will need</span> <span data-start="616.91" data-end="619.339">when the page is generated so and once</span> <span data-start="619.339" data-end="621.98">this when once this happens the image of</span> <span data-start="621.98" data-end="623.54">the image will already have started</span> <span data-start="623.54" data-end="625.939">downloading and will even will be there</span> <span data-start="625.939" data-end="629.24">even even further faster with a really</span> <span data-start="629.24" data-end="634.16">cool and we are yeah the last thing I'd</span> <span data-start="634.16" data-end="636.769">like to talk about is addeventlistener</span> <span data-start="636.769" data-end="641.05">or better yet the third parameter of</span> <span data-start="641.05" data-end="644.449">activated nerve so who of you has seen</span> <span data-start="644.449" data-end="646.6">that before</span> <span data-start="646.6" data-end="651.98">quite a few so what it basically changes</span> <span data-start="651.98" data-end="654.23">the propagation model or how the hell</span> <span data-start="654.23" data-end="656.42">did all events you know so if you set it</span> <span data-start="656.42" data-end="658.639">to false or don't set it at all then</span> <span data-start="658.639" data-end="661.279">event flow basically like this look at</span> <span data-start="661.279" data-end="661.71">my offer</span> <span data-start="661.71" data-end="664.8">we'll be gone when you click on the</span> <span data-start="664.8" data-end="668.04">target then we click target event</span> <span data-start="668.04" data-end="670.14">handlers will will be called first and</span> <span data-start="670.14" data-end="672.24">then the event will basically bubble up</span> <span data-start="672.24" data-end="674.4">or flow up all through all the interface</span> <span data-start="674.4" data-end="676.02">and the event handlers there will be</span> <span data-start="676.02" data-end="680.16">cost blended the default nowadays</span> <span data-start="680.16" data-end="682.83">then there's the it should set it to</span> <span data-start="682.83" data-end="687.06">true then it changes to to something</span> <span data-start="687.06" data-end="688.68">called capturing and this basically</span> <span data-start="688.68" data-end="692.13">reverses the way events flow so the</span> <span data-start="692.13" data-end="694.62">ancestors will get the events first and</span> <span data-start="694.62" data-end="697.05">the inner target the click target itself</span> <span data-start="697.05" data-end="702.24">will receive the event laughs so that</span> <span data-start="702.24" data-end="704.76">even allows outer containers to cancel</span> <span data-start="704.76" data-end="706.8">the event before it even arrives at the</span> <span data-start="706.8" data-end="709.11">click target and you might now ask</span> <span data-start="709.11" data-end="712.02">yourself why is why are two in place I</span> <span data-start="712.02" data-end="714.69">guess is just for circling there were</span> <span data-start="714.69" data-end="717.81">two teams that came up with different</span> <span data-start="717.81" data-end="720.57">solutions for the same problem and now</span> <span data-start="720.57" data-end="724.86">we are we have both vividly but we are</span> <span data-start="724.86" data-end="728.16">pedal for bubbling as we thought ah so</span> <span data-start="728.16" data-end="730.83">that this parameter actually has changed</span> <span data-start="730.83" data-end="733.23">in the last year say so it's not doing</span> <span data-start="733.23" data-end="738.68">it anymore it is now become an object</span> <span data-start="738.68" data-end="741.83">which allows us to configure even more</span> <span data-start="741.83" data-end="745.53">event handler option so the first one</span> <span data-start="745.53" data-end="746.64">which is still in place of course</span> <span data-start="746.64" data-end="748.62">capturing because it was most there</span> <span data-start="748.62" data-end="750.87">before you'll need to be supported but</span> <span data-start="750.87" data-end="752.43">there though there are also two new ones</span> <span data-start="752.43" data-end="754.73">which I would like to talk about briefly</span> <span data-start="754.73" data-end="758.91">the first one being one so if you set</span> <span data-start="758.91" data-end="762.42">one to two then when your event handler</span> <span data-start="762.42" data-end="765.75">is being called then it will be removed</span> <span data-start="765.75" data-end="768.03">automatically for you so it will only be</span> <span data-start="768.03" data-end="770.94">called once the parameter orbiter and</span> <span data-start="770.94" data-end="772.47">that saves us from writing a lot of</span> <span data-start="772.47" data-end="773.01">rollerplate</span> <span data-start="773.01" data-end="775.11">for all using jquery ladies for that</span> <span data-start="775.11" data-end="778.11">matter and then the another one it's a</span> <span data-start="778.11" data-end="780.9">little bit more interesting i say which</span> <span data-start="780.9" data-end="784.74">is passive and so there's one problem</span> <span data-start="784.74" data-end="786.63">with mobile phones so have you ever</span> <span data-start="786.63" data-end="788.91">tried scrolling web page this is awesome</span> <span data-start="788.91" data-end="791.46">pretty janky and this is because when</span> <span data-start="791.46" data-end="793.2">you when you scroll and use for example</span> <span data-start="793.2" data-end="795.42">then you are as a developer</span> <span data-start="795.42" data-end="798.12">able to prevent this touchmove from from</span> <span data-start="798.12" data-end="801.15">happening which is good only one time</span> <span data-start="801.15" data-end="804.03">because it allows to be to be flexible</span> <span data-start="804.03" data-end="806.19">but is also bad because browsers need to</span> <span data-start="806.19" data-end="808.41">wait until all touchmove event vendors</span> <span data-start="808.41" data-end="810.75">are done with their work before they can</span> <span data-start="810.75" data-end="812.25">actually paint a scroll because you</span> <span data-start="812.25" data-end="814.92">could cancel it and then they brother</span> <span data-start="814.92" data-end="817.32">where wouldn't be allowed to scroll and</span> <span data-start="817.32" data-end="820.83">with passive if you can cast pepper true</span> <span data-start="820.83" data-end="822.93">and you are promising the browser that</span> <span data-start="822.93" data-end="825.05">you that you will never ever call</span> <span data-start="825.05" data-end="827.79">prevent default in your codec in your</span> <span data-start="827.79" data-end="829.38">event handler and that allows the</span> <span data-start="829.38" data-end="832.98">browser to adjust painter scrolling and</span> <span data-start="832.98" data-end="835.29">you still can complement before but it</span> <span data-start="835.29" data-end="837.42">won't do anything because you promise</span> <span data-start="837.42" data-end="841.14">that you won't arm one last thing is if</span> <span data-start="841.14" data-end="844.92">you want to use the new version also the</span> <span data-start="844.92" data-end="848.25">object version instead of the full</span> <span data-start="848.25" data-end="849.5">version</span> <span data-start="849.5" data-end="851.76">now you need to feature detected first</span> <span data-start="851.76" data-end="854.91">because imagine you are using something</span> <span data-start="854.91" data-end="856.98">like this in an unsupported browser then</span> <span data-start="856.98" data-end="859.23">so you're giving the option the option</span> <span data-start="859.23" data-end="861.36">object will capture false but what</span> <span data-start="861.36" data-end="862.8">you're what you're actually getting is</span> <span data-start="862.8" data-end="865.59">kept a true because this is an object in</span> <span data-start="865.59" data-end="867.3">a JavaScript object so truthfully and</span> <span data-start="867.3" data-end="870">therefore if you capture is true and</span> <span data-start="870" data-end="872.31">then you're in for a surprise</span> <span data-start="872.31" data-end="875.88">and the the last thing I'd like to show</span> <span data-start="875.88" data-end="877.59">us how to feature the check so basically</span> <span data-start="877.59" data-end="879.36">a quick and dirty way how to do it and I</span> <span data-start="879.36" data-end="881">want to show it because it involves</span> <span data-start="881" data-end="883.56">something I've mentioned earlier which</span> <span data-start="883.56" data-end="886.08">is Gator Gator something so what you</span> <span data-start="886.08" data-end="888.18">what you can do is just add an event</span> <span data-start="888.18" data-end="890.55">listener to any event it doesn't ever</span> <span data-start="890.55" data-end="893.52">have to be called at all and then you</span> <span data-start="893.52" data-end="896.04">use capture but use the getter Center or</span> <span data-start="896.04" data-end="898.89">capture and if the browser supports the</span> <span data-start="898.89" data-end="901.41">object version it will ask you will ask</span> <span data-start="901.41" data-end="903.54">the object that captures will force you</span> <span data-start="903.54" data-end="905.28">to read it and use it and if that's the</span> <span data-start="905.28" data-end="907.8">case then you know it got caught and</span> <span data-start="907.8" data-end="911.91">know that it's supported or not I hope</span> <span data-start="911.91" data-end="919.08">that makes sense now that's basically it</span> <span data-start="919.08" data-end="922.53">already so thank you very much if you</span> <span data-start="922.53" data-end="924.48">still have some that you have questions</span> <span data-start="924.48" data-end="926.51">then don't hesitate these are still</span> <span data-start="926.51" data-end="928.91">eight minutes or so</span> </p>
