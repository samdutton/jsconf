data-end="407.829">installation installation as possible we</span> <span data-start="407.829" data-end="409.779">also wanted to split the sound set</span> <span data-start="409.779" data-end="411.729">because we wanted to represent on them</span> <span data-start="411.729" data-end="413.349">and just to not use whole bandwidth of</span> <span data-start="413.349" data-end="414.819">the userid liver beginning of the game</span> <span data-start="414.819" data-end="417.759">and we also wanted to deliver to I 9</span> <span data-start="417.759" data-end="420.549">users as many sounds as possible or like</span> <span data-start="420.549" data-end="423.249">to other browsers because we met some</span> <span data-start="423.249" data-end="426.399">limitations with 40 LD players created</span> <span data-start="426.399" data-end="430.149">at once and as the game is over 150</span> <span data-start="430.149" data-end="431.19">sounds then</span> <span data-start="431.19" data-end="437.01">this was a little bit hard yeah so let's</span> <span data-start="437.01" data-end="438.3">start with some JavaScript this is</span> <span data-start="438.3" data-end="443.01">example of the config yeah so we have to</span> <span data-start="443.01" data-end="445.02">just pass when the sound starts and when</span> <span data-start="445.02" data-end="447.03">air when the ends this is actually</span> <span data-start="447.03" data-end="449.49">current example from the police games so</span> <span data-start="449.49" data-end="451.68">the prepared name is the idea of the</span> <span data-start="451.68" data-end="453.87">sound afterwards we have ID of the sound</span> <span data-start="453.87" data-end="456.57">sprite and then when it starts so the</span> <span data-start="456.57" data-end="458.49">first one at zero second and ends at</span> <span data-start="458.49" data-end="462.54">three seconds 75 and as we can notice</span> <span data-start="462.54" data-end="464.64">here this breaks between different</span> <span data-start="464.64" data-end="466.29">sounds are two seconds on the next one</span> <span data-start="466.29" data-end="471.48">starting at 575 yeah what's the idea of</span> <span data-start="471.48" data-end="473.67">implementation and this actually ropa</span> <span data-start="473.67" data-end="478.56">for the audio element that we are here</span> <span data-start="478.56" data-end="480.24">playing just fragment of it we are</span> <span data-start="480.24" data-end="482.67">passing this fragment from our config</span> <span data-start="482.67" data-end="485.58">and so at the very beginning we are just</span> <span data-start="485.58" data-end="487.4">setting the current time from the start</span> <span data-start="487.4" data-end="490.44">property from the fragment then</span> <span data-start="490.44" data-end="493.2">assigning even listener time update to</span> <span data-start="493.2" data-end="497.31">so our callback function and we are</span> <span data-start="497.31" data-end="502.47">starting playing sound yeah and on every</span> <span data-start="502.47" data-end="504.63">take of time update which should we take</span> <span data-start="504.63" data-end="506.55">at least once in 250 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="506.55" data-end="509.04">according to specification we are</span> <span data-start="509.04" data-end="511.71">checking if we already reached the end</span> <span data-start="511.71" data-end="517.59">of our sound which is set in config and</span> <span data-start="517.59" data-end="519.419">if so then we are just stopping it and</span> <span data-start="519.419" data-end="522.36">then we can do some reset of it and set</span> <span data-start="522.36" data-end="527.91">some extra states as we already said few</span> <span data-start="527.91" data-end="529.2">words about the silence between</span> <span data-start="529.2" data-end="532.7">different sounds with merge into one</span> <span data-start="532.7" data-end="535.11">yeah we have to summon determine what is</span> <span data-start="535.11" data-end="539.43">the optimal vows this is important</span> <span data-start="539.43" data-end="541.589">because this also some make impact to</span> <span data-start="541.589" data-end="545.4">the file size and this time updates</span> <span data-start="545.4" data-end="547.14">whistling said that it should be trigger</span> <span data-start="547.14" data-end="549.66">at least once in 250 milliseconds but if</span> <span data-start="549.66" data-end="552.81">is there's something going on the</span> <span data-start="552.81" data-end="554.7">background like game with some</span> <span data-start="554.7" data-end="558.42">animations and we are running it on</span> <span data-start="558.42" data-end="560.769">mobiles then it could be triggered</span> <span data-start="560.769" data-end="562.689">a little bit less often so we can reach</span> <span data-start="562.689" data-end="565.42">summing over one second so if you wanted</span> <span data-start="565.42" data-end="567.189">to avoid some glitches we have to differ</span> <span data-start="567.189" data-end="570.489">mine or our devices what will be the</span> <span data-start="570.489" data-end="574.3">perfect house and as we can notice on</span> <span data-start="574.3" data-end="577.779">the graph on the bottom the file size of</span> <span data-start="577.779" data-end="581.86">it is not really a different usually we</span> <span data-start="581.86" data-end="584.41">can oh no GG we can always make hip</span> <span data-start="584.41" data-end="587.23">smaller files Matty mp3's somehow a</span> <span data-start="587.23" data-end="589.839">little bit worse especially with</span> <span data-start="589.839" data-end="592.989">compressing the silence it was important</span> <span data-start="592.989" data-end="595.089">when we are compressing files which</span> <span data-start="595.089" data-end="597.79">always should use vb air so for a bit</span> <span data-start="597.79" data-end="600.009">rate because it's compressing silence</span> <span data-start="600.009" data-end="603.85">really well yeah if we wanted to hip</span> <span data-start="603.85" data-end="605.799">numbers here's comparison other sprites</span> <span data-start="605.799" data-end="608.319">to separate files so as you can notice</span> <span data-start="608.319" data-end="612.85">the OGG is always almost eight person</span> <span data-start="612.85" data-end="616.36">better the mp3 is a little bit worse and</span> <span data-start="616.36" data-end="619.119">it's anyway growing instantly linear</span> <span data-start="619.119" data-end="622.959">rate about eight percent on every jump</span> <span data-start="622.959" data-end="625.72">of the second the Emperor is a little</span> <span data-start="625.72" data-end="630.04">bit smaller but it's not huge issue yeah</span> <span data-start="630.04" data-end="634.629">let's move to the tests on the browser's</span> <span data-start="634.629" data-end="636.519">we tasted memory usage in spears edge</span> <span data-start="636.519" data-end="638.559">for them and we tested the newest chrome</span> <span data-start="638.559"

data-start="716.47" data-end="719.339">police case it's really good for the</span> <span data-start="719.339" data-end="722.23">sound sprites we are saving a lot of</span> <span data-start="722.23" data-end="725.11">memory especially because of audio</span> <span data-start="725.11" data-end="728.579">elements so it's like twice smaller and</span> <span data-start="728.579" data-end="733.42">yep a little bit different is for 10</span> <span data-start="733.42" data-end="735.1">sounds at once our escape as we can</span> <span data-start="735.1" data-end="736.81">notice if you have to create more algae</span> <span data-start="736.81" data-end="739.06">elements which are handling bigger files</span> <span data-start="739.06" data-end="742.66">more usage will be way bigger so I think</span> <span data-start="742.66" data-end="748.24">in games like counter-strike where we</span> <span data-start="748.24" data-end="750.22">have a lot of explosions or something we</span> <span data-start="750.22" data-end="756.04">can think about other solution talking</span> <span data-start="756.04" data-end="758.199">about Maury I would also like to show</span> <span data-start="758.199" data-end="760.36">you the difference between what we get</span> <span data-start="760.36" data-end="762.819">the more usage when we enable sounds and</span> <span data-start="762.819" data-end="764.29">we are just creating out the elements</span> <span data-start="764.29" data-end="767.529">and after we play them so integral</span> <span data-start="767.529" data-end="769.87">politics case we can notice that if the</span> <span data-start="769.87" data-end="771.55">percentage comparison it's almost the</span> <span data-start="771.55" data-end="773.529">same for the sprites and for the</span> <span data-start="773.529" data-end="779.339">separate sounds so nothing really</span> <span data-start="779.339" data-end="781.689">interesting but for the ten cents at</span> <span data-start="781.689" data-end="783.1">once when we are creating a lot of new</span> <span data-start="783.1" data-end="785.829">of the elements the difference from the</span> <span data-start="785.829" data-end="788.139">beginning and the afterwards it's really</span> <span data-start="788.139" data-end="791.259">huge so we can be surprised afterwards</span> <span data-start="791.259" data-end="793.72">that the more you is so big and what we</span> <span data-start="793.72" data-end="795.1">have to do with that and handle all</span> <span data-start="795.1" data-end="800.35">these additional audio Clemens cpu usage</span> <span data-start="800.35" data-end="803.68">for sounds are usually it's usually not</span> <span

<p><span data-start="807.25" data-end="809.05">CP usage when we are playing one sound</span> <span data-start="809.05" data-end="812.35">the pics here which we can notice it's</span> <span data-start="812.35" data-end="814.629">like only when we are setting current</span> <span data-start="814.629" data-end="816.759">time for so we are starting the new</span> <span data-start="816.759" data-end="821.47">audio sprite part it's of course</span> <span data-start="821.47" data-end="823.75">different for 10 sound at once when at</span> <span data-start="823.75" data-end="825.22">the beginning we are creating the new</span> <span data-start="825.22" data-end="827.559">audio elements and we are trying to set</span> <span data-start="827.559" data-end="828.54">them</span> <span data-start="828.54" data-end="830.829">as you can notice at the beginning is a</span> <span data-start="830.829" data-end="833.199">huge pig so for example chrome was using</span> <span data-start="833.199" data-end="836.009">almost whole accord running it and</span> <span data-start="836.009" data-end="838.54">afterwards anyway this p usage is like</span> <span data-start="838.54" data-end="841.689">ten percent so it's really big and</span> <span data-start="841.689" data-end="843.339">especially comparing two mobiles where</span> <span data-start="843.339" data-end="845.169">we are trying to run it and we don't</span> <span data-start="845.169" data-end="849.399">have so much yet operation per second it</span> <span data-start="849.399" data-end="852.79">could be a little bit problem on the</span> <span data-start="852.79" data-end="854.769">firefox we can only notice that these</span> <span data-start="854.769" data-end="859.059">jumps for the time update handling it</span> <span data-start="859.059" data-end="861.639">the last week which we tested our size</span> <span data-start="861.639" data-end="865.839">of files so we i already spoil it the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="865.839" data-end="869.709">OGG is smaller usually always mp3 it's</span> <span data-start="869.709" data-end="871.419">sometimes smaller sometimes bigger this</span> <span data-start="871.419" data-end="873.129">we can notice if we have bigger files</span> <span data-start="873.129" data-end="875.23">and usually a little bit smaller for the</span> <span data-start="875.23" data-end="878.649">hours a little bit bigger and m4a is</span> <span data-start="878.649" data-end="883.48">slightly small difference and yeah the</span> <span data-start="883.48" data-end="885.16">arab speed factor is still number of</span> <span data-start="885.16" data-end="887.319">requests so in the group police game we</span> <span data-start="887.319" data-end="889.689">went down from 150 to request for this</span> <span data-start="889.689" data-end="892.089">sounds 213 which is quite awesome it's</span> <span data-start="892.089" data-end="896.049">like an eight percent of that yeah for</span> <span data-start="896.049" data-end="899.29">the other this is exactly size of the</span> <span data-start="899.29" data-end="908.829">files so let's do a short summary so</span> <span data-start="908.829" data-end="910.329">what we wanted to achieve in the grip</span> <span data-start="910.329" data-end="914.529">police game and what we wanted to</span> <span data-start="914.529" data-end="917.169">achieve anyway using other sprites is to</span> <span data-start="917.169" data-end="919.209">prepare solution for IE somehow to get</span> <span data-start="919.209" data-end="921.519">immediate access to all of them without</span> <span data-start="921.519" data-end="923.379">creating magnetic how many others price</span> <span data-start="923.379" data-end="925.839">we already have and for mobiles is also</span> <span data-start="925.839" data-end="927.579">really important where we have</span> <span data-start="927.579" data-end="931.119">limitations with the memory we also</span> <span data-start="931.119" data-end="934.48">achieve the smaller files they're less</span> <span data-start="934.48" data-end="936.639">dreary place to the service so somehow</span> <span data-start="936.639" data-end="939.16">we can also avoid situation that there</span> <span data-start="939.16" data-end="940.869">are some errors or river during the</span> <span data-start="940.869" data-end="944.369">creation the connection to server the</span> <span data-start="944.369" data-end="946.929">integral police case the group police</span> <span data-start="946.929" data-end="948.759">game we reach also lower memory usage</span> <span data-start="948.759" data-end="950.859">during the plank and creation of all</span> <span data-start="950.859" data-end="954.369">these parts and for the others who</span> <span data-start="954.369" data-end="955.72">wanted to</span> <span data-start="955.72" data-end="958.089">test it if it's really Worf to use it</span> <span data-start="958.089" data-end="960.759">it's supported by quite known libraries</span> <span data-start="960.759" data-end="963.339">likes a minute or two so just feel free</span> <span data-start="963.339" data-end="968.8">and put it there with the config what we</span> <span data-start="968.8" data-end="970.42">didn't want to achieve and what was</span> <span data-start="970.42" data-end="972.91">shown on this are our edge case it's</span> <span data-start="972.91" data-end="976.209">like 10 sounds at once case and where</span> <span data-start="976.209" data-end="978.55">this piece which is really high and the</span> <span data-start="978.55" data-end="982.029">memorial usage is really high there are</span> <span data-start="982.029" data-end="985.06">other bad parts I'll like a complicated</span> <span data-start="985.06" data-end="987.97">culture right if you wanted to do it by</span> <span data-start="987.97" data-end="991">this libraries and library by our own so</span> <span data-start="991" data-end="993.579">in this situation we have to catch all</span> <span data-start="993.579" data-end="995.62">these events and we have to take care</span> <span data-start="995.62" data-end="999.16">when to stop when to start which rely on</span> <span data-start="999.16" data-end="1001.23">time average event which I already told</span> <span data-start="1001.23" data-end="1004.709">it's kind of buggy or not baggy but it's</span> <span data-start="1004.709" data-end="1007.1">not really reliable so on the mobiles we</span> <span data-start="1007.1"
