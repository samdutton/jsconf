data-start="24.17" data-end="26.33">little about 12 years in the industry I</span> <span data-start="26.33" data-end="29.21">spent most of my career working on back</span> <span data-start="29.21" data-end="32.689">in Java and.net applications but over</span> <span data-start="32.689" data-end="35.06">the last few years I have worked a lot</span> <span data-start="35.06" data-end="36.74">in front in JavaScript applications</span> <span data-start="36.74" data-end="40.07">within large enterprises and it's been a</span> <span data-start="40.07" data-end="41.45">lot of fun working with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="41.45" data-end="43.46">within the enterprise but at the same</span> <span data-start="43.46" data-end="45.35">time there are a few lessons that I've</span> <span data-start="45.35" data-end="47.09">learned that I'd like to share with</span> <span data-start="47.09" data-end="49.52">y'all the intent is so that when you</span> <span data-start="49.52" data-end="51.44">take JavaScript into the enterprise you</span> <span data-start="51.44" data-end="52.76">are more productive within the</span> <span data-start="52.76" data-end="55.46">enterprise you also reduce risk for an</span> <span data-start="55.46" data-end="57.829">enterprise and at the same time enjoy</span> <span data-start="57.829" data-end="59.75">working with JavaScript within the</span> <span data-start="59.75" data-end="64.009">enterprise so I'm going to be primarily</span> <span data-start="64.009" data-end="66.83">focusing on three things the first one</span> <span data-start="66.83" data-end="68.6">is expectations within an enterprise</span> <span data-start="68.6" data-end="71.71">when it comes to building software and</span> <span data-start="71.71" data-end="74.21">then I'm going to go over enterprise</span> <span data-start="74.21" data-end="76.79">planning and the impact of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="76.79" data-end="78.979">when it comes to planning within an</span> <span data-start="78.979" data-end="81.14">enterprise and then I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="81.14" data-end="82.76">about certain constraints that are</span> <span data-start="82.76" data-end="85.19">present in large enterprises that can</span> <span data-start="85.19" data-end="90.2">act as barriers at times so let me start</span> <span data-start="90.2" data-end="93.2">with the enterprise expectations these</span> <span data-start="93.2" data-end="95.119">are things that need to be managed well</span> <span data-start="95.119" data-end="97.4">if not the reality ends up in the</span> <span data-start="97.4" data-end="101.869">opposite direction at times so the first</span> <span data-start="101.869" data-end="104.84">one I want to focus on is there's an</span> <span data-start="104.84" data-end="106.31">expectation within enterprises of</span> <span data-start="106.31" data-end="109.189">modularization enterprises by the nature</span> <span data-start="109.189" data-end="110.84">of their size and their geographical</span> <span data-start="110.84" data-end="113.21">distribution often run similar</span> <span data-start="113.21" data-end="115.54">businesses in different regions and</span> <span data-start="115.54" data-end="118.64">there is always high appetite for reuse</span> <span data-start="118.64" data-end="120.83">within an enterprise an application</span> <span data-start="120.83" data-end="122.9">built in one place they want the same</span> <span data-start="122.9" data-end="124.67">look and feel similar experience in</span> <span data-start="124.67" data-end="125.99">other regions so they want to reuse a</span> <span data-start="125.99" data-end="128.499">lot of the code that is being used</span> <span data-start="128.499" data-end="130.879">sometimes these things in large</span> <span data-start="130.879" data-end="133.27">enterprises are not use case drivel</span> <span data-start="133.27" data-end="135.65">so if we don't put a thought towards</span> <span data-start="135.65" data-end="139.3">modularization or we use a bad use case</span> <span data-start="139.3" data-end="142.1">you can end up with very high costs when</span> <span data-start="142.1" data-end="143.39">it comes to reuse of your code across</span> <span data-start="143.39" data-end="145.64">regions and this is something that</span> <span data-start="145.64" data-end="148.43">enterprises don't like at the same time</span> <span data-start="148.43" data-end="150.11">if you don't have a proper use case for</span> <span data-start="150.11" data-end="153.26">this reuse you end up over engineering</span> <span data-start="153.26" data-end="157.22">the concept of modularization so how do</span> <span data-start="157.22" data-end="159.47">we r immediate this right so what we can</span> <span data-start="159.47" data-end="161.33">do is we can try and prepare for this</span> <span data-start="161.33" data-end="164.45">modularization not overthink it so you</span> <span data-start="164.45" data-end="167.959">favor building loosely coupled code try</span> <span data-start="167.959" data-end="170.87">and build modules in JavaScript but at</span> <span data-start="170.87" data-end="172.75">the same time make sure these modules</span> <span data-start="172.75" data-end="174.65">communicate with other modules through</span> <span data-start="174.65" data-end="176.87">events rather than point-to-point</span> <span data-start="176.87" data-end="179">communication for example if you have a</span> <span data-start="179" data-end="181.7">module that logs in that it raised an</span> <span data-start="181.7" data-end="183.23">event once you're successfully logged in</span> <span data-start="183.23" data-end="184.91">and people who are interested in that</span> <span data-start="184.91" data-end="187.55">event can then react that way this code</span> <span data-start="187.55" data-end="189.56">is much more reusable than coupling your</span> <span data-start="189.56" data-end="192.95">login module two different modules try</span> <span data-start="192.95" data-end="196.61">and share your code as widgets rather</span> <span data-start="196.61" data-end="199.75">than as big modules that have</span> <span data-start="199.75" data-end="203.239">functionality so these widgets can be</span> <span data-start="203.239" data-end="205.73">configurable you can have them as</span> <span data-start="205.73" data-end="208.01">resealable widgets make them responsive</span> <span data-start="208.01" data-end="209.989">then these widgets can be used in</span> <span data-start="209.989" data-end="211.25">different applications within an</span> <span data-start="211.25" data-end="215.03">enterprise at the same time start by</span> <span data-start="215.03" data-end="218.209">packaging your code so you can share</span> <span data-start="218.209" data-end="220.43">your code as bower components you can</span> <span data-start="220.43" data-end="222.89">share them as node modules use a

<span data-start="229.76" data-end="232.31">within enterprises if you see it's very</span> <span data-start="232.31" data-end="233.989">difficult to create a module and and</span> <span data-start="233.989" data-end="235.579">upload it onto the internet into a</span> <span data-start="235.579" data-end="237.38">public repository this is something that</span> <span data-start="237.38" data-end="240.32">enterprises wouldn't allow and in this</span> <span data-start="240.32" data-end="242.54">case it's important that if you want to</span> <span data-start="242.54" data-end="245.989">do node or power you have an internal</span> <span data-start="245.989" data-end="248.239">module depository so you can use a tool</span> <span data-start="248.239" data-end="250.7">such as artifactory and artifactory</span> <span data-start="250.7" data-end="253.459">supports power and npm so you can upload</span> <span data-start="253.459"

this very early the next thing</span> </p>

lot</span> <span data-start="569.67" data-end="573.03">of churn and this churn could result in</span> <span data-start="573.03" data-end="574.68">frequent rewrites and this is often</span> <span data-start="574.68" data-end="576.66">unanticipated when it comes to a</span> <span data-start="576.66" data-end="580.68">year-long worth of work right and just</span> <span data-start="580.68" data-end="582.12">to pursue that your long worth of work</span> <span data-start="582.12" data-end="583.92">if we don't stay on the upgrade path</span> <span data-start="583.92" data-end="585.93">this is going to increase the cost and</span> <span data-start="585.93" data-end="593.61">risk of delaying this sorry so how do we</span> <span data-start="593.61" data-end="596.28">r immediate this situation right so it</span> <span data-start="596.28" data-end="597.75">would be good if we can prepare for this</span> <span data-start="597.75" data-end="601.05">churn you know and then protect yourself</span> <span data-start="601.05" data-end="603.72">from the churn and create a Java Script</span> <span data-start="603.72" data-end="609.36">decorator within the enterprise so I'll</span> <span data-start="609.36" data-end="610.53">talk a bit about preparing for this</span> <span data-start="610.53" data-end="614.06">journal so often front-end code has been</span> <span data-start="614.06" data-end="616.47">mainly for validation purposes but</span> <span data-start="616.47" data-end="617.97">things have changed right we are now</span> <span data-start="617.97" data-end="619.5">using frameworks such as angular or</span> <span data-start="619.5" data-end="621.78">ember wherein you can have a lot of</span> <span data-start="621.78" data-end="623.85">logic sitting within the front end now I</span> <span data-start="623.85" data-end="625.95">think a lot of the programming</span> <span data-start="625.95" data-end="627.39">principles that apply to back-end code</span> <span data-start="627.39" data-end="628.94">apply to your front and software as well</span> <span data-start="628.94" data-end="631.92">so within your MVC framework as well you</span> <span data-start="631.92" data-end="634.32">can layer your code into controllers</span> <span data-start="634.32" data-end="636.72">that manage your UI and then you can</span> <span data-start="636.72" data-end="638.64">have layers of code such as facades that</span> <span data-start="638.64" data-end="640.56">you know delegate to a service layer</span> <span data-start="640.56" data-end="644.37">which then talk to your back-end now if</span> <span data-start="644.37" data-end="646.65">you do not want to couple yourself to a</span> <span data-start="646.65" data-end="648.93">framework try and keep your facade</span> <span data-start="648.93" data-end="651.47">services etc and plain old JavaScript</span> <span data-start="651.47" data-end="653.58">because then it makes it easier to</span> <span data-start="653.58" data-end="655.26">change because only your controllers</span> <span data-start="655.26" data-end="656.64">then are coupled to a framework that's</span> <span data-start="656.64" data-end="660.66">undergoing the chump also try and use</span> <span data-start="660.66" data-end="662.82">dependency injection for whatever</span> <span data-start="662.82" data-end="665.85">objects that you build things like xmas</span> <span data-start="665.85" data-end="668.37">six modules or required a system days</span> <span data-start="668.37" data-end="670.44">these help you inject dependencies and</span> <span data-start="670.44" data-end="671.819">makes it much more easy to unit test</span> <span data-start="671.819" data-end="673.5">your code right and swapping out</span> <span data-start="673.5" data-end="677.759">dependencies becomes easier once you are</span> <span data-start="677.759" data-end="680.399">prepared protect yourself as well from</span> <span data-start="680.399" data-end="684.8">this Joan so favor hi unit test coverage</span> <span data-start="684.8" data-end="688.079">at the same time try and make sure that</span> <span data-start="688.079" data-end="689.49">your unit tests are not coupled to the</span> <span data-start="689.49" data-end="690.779">framework that's undergoing shown</span> <span data-start="690.779" data-end="693.779">because these are your safety net and if</span> <span data-start="693.779" data-end="695.819">they break when the framework changes</span> <span data-start="695.819" data-end="697.709">then you do not have anything to verify</span> <span data-start="697.709" data-end="699">that your code is still doing what it</span> <span data-start="699" data-end="702.36">was supposed to write so and then have</span> <span data-start="702.36" data-end="703.92">high functional test coverage as well</span> <span data-start="703.92" data-end="705.81">these often don't tend to make</span> <span data-start="705.81" data-end="707.94">assumptions of the underlying

data-start="711.24" data-end="713.22">shouldn't change and they can be your</span> <span data-start="713.22" data-end="716.459">safety net lastly to work well with the</span> <span data-start="716.459" data-end="718.259">business make sure that you factor the</span> <span data-start="718.259" data-end="720">upgrades for the software choices that</span> <span data-start="720" data-end="723.75">you've made into the plan and plan your</span> <span data-start="723.75" data-end="725.79">work accordingly make sure you include</span> <span data-start="725.79" data-end="727.74">your tests and documentation because</span> <span data-start="727.74" data-end="729.06">these two might change because of the</span> <span data-start="729.06"

data-start="812.639" data-end="814.2">of these browsers are not even available</span> <span data-start="814.2" data-end="816.3">within the enterprise so enterprises</span> <span data-start="816.3" data-end="818.519">have a way of you know installing</span> <span data-start="818.519" data-end="820.38">software and it's very hard to get the</span> <span data-start="820.38" data-end="823.709">kind

data-start="844.139" data-end="848.22">the ways to remediate this is you could</span> <span data-start="848.22" data-end="850.8">use analytics from applications that</span> <span data-start="850.8" data-end="851.73">have already been built in the</span> <span data-start="851.73" data-end="854.07">enterprise to know what is the browser</span> <span data-start="854.07" data-end="855.449">said that

<span data-start="866.01" data-end="867.72">that you can deliver in an agile fashion</span> <span data-start="867.72" data-end="868.89">and you don't know how to have to delay</span> <span
