wind it on iron and you're back to</span> <span data-start="1347.35" data-end="1351.37">where you were you started with so what</span> <span data-start="1351.37" data-end="1352.96">we need to do is we need to wrap</span> <span data-start="1352.96" data-end="1355.57">everything so we need to wrap something</span> <span data-start="1355.57" data-end="1358.72">in ice what we call in Python is a</span> <span data-start="1358.72" data-end="1361.149">decorator but some just have a function</span> <span data-start="1361.149" data-end="1363.46">that calls your other function so you</span> <span data-start="1363.46" data-end="1364.899">just call this wrap function and pass</span> <span data-start="1364.899" data-end="1366.22">the argument of the function you're</span> <span data-start="1366.22" data-end="1367.51">actually calling and this would do the</span> <span data-start="1367.51" data-end="1371.289">magic for you in a very generic way so</span> <span data-start="1371.289" data-end="1373.24">this looks is the only thing we had to</span> <span data-start="1373.24" data-end="1375.61">change is this first line we just wrap</span> <span data-start="1375.61" data-end="1380.769">our entire outer function with a wrap</span> <span data-start="1380.769" data-end="1382.51">there's gonna be some caveats with that</span> <span data-start="1382.51" data-end="1384.97">because it obviously is within the</span> <span data-start="1384.97" data-end="1386.95">current stack so anything that you call</span> <span data-start="1386.95" data-end="1388.63">as an async callback is not going to be</span> <span data-start="1388.63" data-end="1391.149">within this stack so you to wrap all of</span> <span data-start="1391.149" data-end="1393.909">the your AC callbacks as well in this</span> <span data-start="1393.909" data-end="1397.899">wrap so that sounds pretty cumbersome as</span> <span data-start="1397.899" data-end="1401.11">well so and the last thing that once a</span> <span data-start="1401.11" data-end="1403.63">turn real quick is a century so as I</span> <span data-start="1403.63" data-end="1404.919">talked about that I'm a core contributor</span> <span data-start="1404.919" data-end="1407.169">century and we have this library to go</span> <span

data-start="1412.269" data-end="1414.34">terrible things for you we do this</span> <span data-start="1414.34" data-end="1416.47">through means of monkey patching we</span> <span data-start="1416.47" data-end="1419.559">patch libraries we patch into libraries</span> <span data-start="1419.559" data-end="1421.6">exception handlers so for example</span> <span data-start="1421.6" data-end="1423.789">angular has this global callback which</span> <span data-start="1423.789" data-end="1426.279">is effectively their windowed on iron we</span> <span data-start="1426.279" data-end="1427.87">inject into all these things and we try</span> <span data-start="1427.87" data-end="1429.37">to capture all these things for you and</span> <span data-start="1429.37" data-end="1432.46">then we send that along to a server so</span> <span data-start="1432.46" data-end="1434.44">we monkey patch we also monkey patch the</span> <span data-start="1434.44" data-end="1436.659">native objects so we monkey patch a set</span> <span data-start="1436.659" data-end="1438.789">timeout set interval like it gets pretty</span> <span data-start="1438.789" data-end="1443.98">obtrusive but it does this job the raven</span> <span data-start="1443.98" data-end="1445.24">parses the error reports the information</span> <span data-start="1445.24" data-end="1447.669">to the central central server the Sentry</span> <span data-start="1447.669" data-end="1448.99">will fetch your source maps and give you</span> <span data-start="1448.99"
