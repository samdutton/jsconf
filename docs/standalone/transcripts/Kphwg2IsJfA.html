the</span> <span data-start="111.45" data-end="112.079">code</span> <span data-start="112.079" data-end="116.24">the initial version had some issues</span> <span data-start="116.24" data-end="118.979">first of all it was a mono life</span> <span data-start="118.979" data-end="121.17">application so after six months after</span> <span data-start="121.17" data-end="123.57">one year they realized that was an</span> <span data-start="123.57" data-end="125.909">application was hard to evolve hard to</span> <span data-start="125.909" data-end="128.879">maintain like add the feature

data-end="143.1">layers and data based layers and</span> <span data-start="143.1" data-end="145.41">back-end layers everything was you guys</span> <span data-start="145.41" data-end="147.18">in the

that in</span> <span data-start="152.97" data-end="155.43">that moment was not the main focus but</span> <span data-start="155.43" data-end="158.1">it started to be and because of mix of</span> <span data-start="158.1" data-end="162.33">layers they had some issues one of the</span> <span data-start="162.33" data-end="165.15">issues was related to the page load like</span> <span data-start="165.15" data-end="168">as you guys can see you have three HTTP</span> <span data-start="168" data-end="172.019">requests each one for each component but</span> <span data-start="172.019" data-end="174.72">you

data-end="205.32">realized okay now we have two code bases</span> <span data-start="205.32" data-end="208.73">we have to duplicate a logic which is</span> <span data-start="208.73" data-end="213.19">insane</span> <span data-start="213.2" data-end="216.51">another point pretty much this company</span> <span data-start="216.51" data-end="222.45">had to care a lot about SEO and Google's</span> <span data-start="222.45" data-end="224.91">not benevolent if you're not following</span> <span data-start="224.91" data-end="227.43">the rules not only Google every surgeon</span>

really really bad numbers like ten</span> <span data-start="242.01" data-end="245.07">performers and this was just example</span> <span data-start="245.07" data-end="249.359">using a tool called lighthouse and it's</span> <span data-start="249.359" data-end="253.31">enough so okay we know those points and</span> <span data-start="253.31" data-end="255.81">we know the code wedgie time when you</span> <span data-start="255.81" data-end="257.729">look is something like that you have</span> <span data-start="257.729" data-end="259.979">that feeling it really have that feeling</span> <span data-start="259.979" data-end="263.64">geez it's hard to maintain so what</span> <span data-start="263.64" data-end="265.289">happens every time there had that</span> <span data-start="265.289" data-end="266.85">feeling you try to avoid</span> <span data-start="266.85" data-end="269.76">that behavior okay if I just wanted to</span> <span data-start="269.76" data-end="271.8">add something of just add more code add</span> <span data-start="271.8" data-end="274.34">more code it's a natural behavior</span> <span data-start="274.34" data-end="276.89">it's not a good way to play this game</span> <span data-start="276.89" data-end="285.51">not at all so okay we came into this</span> <span data-start="285.51" data-end="290.16">idea why not now that we have the</span> <span

about</span> <span data-start="715.68" data-end="717.36">the mono live application right so we</span> <span data-start="717.36" data-end="721.11">need to clean the kitchen before start</span> <span data-start="721.11" data-end="722.48">cook</span> <span data-start="722.48" data-end="726.05">first of all online design teams and</span> <span data-start="726.05" data-end="729.48">your developer teams to they should work</span> <span data-start="729.48" data-end="731.97">together and they have a lot of approach</span> <span data-start="731.97" data-end="734.94">talk about front-end right now one of</span> <span data-start="734.94" data-end="737.97">old code but really really useful is</span> <span data-start="737.97" data-end="742.83">atomic design by Brad Frost concept is</span> <span data-start="742.83" data-end="745.05">quite it's quite interesting like you</span> <span data-start="745.05" data-end="748.23">have atoms molecules start to be</span> <span data-start="748.23" data-end="751.62">granular until you become with a page</span> <span data-start="751.62" data-end="755.79">and but it was a long time ago that was</span> <span data-start="755.79" data-end="757.32">created now you have a lot of other</span> <span data-start="757.32" data-end="760.56">options so keep open like like we have</span> <span data-start="760.56" data-end="762.69">here at the bottom we are talking about</span> <span data-start="762.69" data-end="765.21">material design which pretty much same</span> <span data-start="765.21" data-end="768.21">idea outline everything all the teams</span> <span data-start="768.21" data-end="770.76">should be thinking together we have the</span> <span data-start="770.76" data-end="776.28">same goal and things interesting about</span> <span data-start="776.28" data-end="780">those two approaches at the end they</span> <span data-start="780" data-end="783.54">have the same goal this same idea so the</span> <span data-start="783.54" data-end="786.78">page one component is a composition of</span> <span data-start="786.78" data-end="791.7">components page two you can use or not</span> <span data-start="791.7" data-end="794.52">one of those components and it starts to</span> <span data-start="794.52" data-end="798.28">be things they start to be plug and play</span> <span data-start="798.28" data-end="802.75">and everything's a component like if you</span> <span data-start="802.75" data-end="805.62">go back here with talk about pages and</span> <span data-start="805.62" data-end="808.18">other protectress parts pretty much</span> <span data-start="808.18" data-end="810.61">component page one is a component and</span> <span data-start="810.61" data-end="815.2">all the UI components are creating our</span> <span data-start="815.2" data-end="820.15">kupuna still so Y components it's all</span> <span data-start="820.15" data-end="822.37">scope so you really have well-defined</span> <span data-start="822.37" data-end="826.66">boundaries about that idea okay I'm</span> <span data-start="826.66" data-end="829.54">doing a search box I don't need to know</span> <span data-start="829.54" data-end="831.7">about the whole world I just need to</span> <span data-start="831.7" data-end="835.03">know how to do a search and sometimes</span> <span data-start="835.03" data-end="836.08">that doesn't I just</span> <span data-start="836.08" data-end="837.67">even need to know like if you have a</span> <span data-start="837.67" data-end="839.35">really component totally the corporate</span> <span data-start="839.35" data-end="841.48">you don't even know any to know that we</span> <span data-start="841.48" data-end="843.88">have to cop something in some way and</span> <span data-start="843.88" data-end="847.84">should work and everything component is</span> <span data-start="847.84" data-end="850.48">kind of plug and play which is great</span> <span data-start="850.48" data-end="853">that was the first idea of the component</span> <span data-start="853" data-end="862.23">and that was the idea right beautiful</span> <span data-start="862.23" data-end="864.7">other things we talked about teams</span> <span data-start="864.7" data-end="867.07">distributed teams so when you do a small</span> <span data-start="867.07" data-end="870.28">component it doesn't matter if a small</span> <span data-start="870.28" data-end="872.17">component which has been used in only</span> <span data-start="872.17" data-end="875.88">one page or 30 pages please think about</span> <span data-start="875.88" data-end="879.64">empathy all the teens shouldn't prove</span> <span data-start="879.64" data-end="882.07">that that code should evolve that code</span> <span data-start="882.07" data-end="885.52">it is one idea create demo page in this</span> <span data-start="885.52" data-end="888.94">case it's being used storybook which is</span> <span data-start="888.94" data-end="891.28">a pretty cool library then you can you</span> <span data-start="891.28" data-end="894.7">can integrate if all the best frameworks</span> <span data-start="894.7" data-end="897.13">that we have right now and in the other</span> <span data-start="897.13" data-end="898.66">side you have Auto validation so you can</span> <span data-start="898.66" data-end="900.82">read easily prologue in play you can</span> <span data-start="900.82" data-end="903.4">create scenarios create some fixtures</span> <span data-start="903.4" data-end="905.83">okay you have this component and when</span> <span data-start="905.83" data-end="908.589">this component app receives a specific</span> <span data-start="908.589" data-end="911.02">property or when this property changed</span> <span data-start="911.02" data-end="913.39">what should happen you have all the</span> <span data-start="913.39" data-end="916.57">things together so easy it's easy to</span> <span data-start="916.57" data-end="918.46">read it me someone who don't know how to</span> <span data-start="918.46" data-end="921.13">code know what that cop that component</span> <span data-start="921.13" data-end="928.019">thus and on think that now is</span> <span data-start="928.029" data-end="930.519">really really up a string and it's</span> <span data-start="930.519" data-end="931.93">interesting that we have this discussion</span> <span data-start="931.93" data-end="933.939">right now because years ago we didn't</span> <span data-start="933.939" data-end="937.6">have it's about zero config part forms I</span> <span data-start="937.6" data-end="940.629">would say you can have bundles with the</span> <span data-start="940.629" data-end="942.939">your config you can have a setup with 0</span> <span data-start="942.939" data-end="946.93">config and so on but a long time ago we</span> <span data-start="946.93" data-end="948.61">didn't have this discussion so we didn't</span> <span data-start="948.61" data-end="950.319">have a lot of packages open source</span> <span data-start="950.319" data-end="953.889">packages so in some scenarios you just</span> <span data-start="953.889" data-end="956.709">can't use one of those zero configs</span> <span data-start="956.709" data-end="958.42">because of a lot of reasons internal</span> <span data-start="958.42" data-end="961.11">reasons and some business reasons or</span> <span data-start="961.11" data-end="965.829">even some rules based on the country in</span> <span data-start="965.829" data-end="968.41">those and others think and boilerplates</span> <span data-start="968.41" data-end="971.74">as a solution I will explain a little</span> <span data-start="971.74" data-end="974.939">bit more about it like why zero config</span> <span data-start="974.939" data-end="979.449">first of all opinions everyone here has</span> <span data-start="979.449" data-end="982.439">a really and great opinion about all</span> <span data-start="982.439" data-end="987.75">those steps bundle tests publish linked</span> <span data-start="987.75" data-end="990.939">we have a lot of tool is for linked</span> <span data-start="990.939" data-end="996.04">right now reporter and so on and if you</span> <span data-start="996.04" data-end="998.29">look at github right now it's pretty</span> <span data-start="998.29" data-end="1000.509">impressive because when we start the</span> <span data-start="1000.509" data-end="1002.49">discussions you can find a lot of other</span> <span data-start="1002.49" data-end="1004.47">packages talking about zero</span> <span data-start="1004.47" data-end="1007.459">configuration such as great react app or</span> <span data-start="1007.459" data-end="1013.92">angular CLI ember CLI and this is great</span> <span data-start="1013.92" data-end="1017.269">for us because there's a lot of opinions</span> <span data-start="1017.269" data-end="1025.049">that we can integrate or extend however</span> <span data-start="1025.049" data-end="1027.51">as I said before in some scenarios you</span> <span data-start="1027.51" data-end="1031.11">cannot just use one of this okay let's</span> <span data-start="1031.11" data-end="1034.53">think about a good way to integrate you</span> <span data-start="1034.53" data-end="1036.299">have a tooling for example can be you</span> <span data-start="1036.299" data-end="1039.12">just use a yeoman generator just for a</span> <span data-start="1039.12" data-end="1041.61">small piece as we said before we are</span> <span data-start="1041.61" data-end="1043.589">working with components so we can create</span> <span data-start="1043.589" data-end="1045.72">a small piece and can create as a</span> <span data-start="1045.72" data-end="1050.46">standard in your team's and photos for</span> <span data-start="1050.46" data-end="1052.74">those if you have to improve or like</span> <span data-start="1052.74" data-end="1055.77">your boilerplate just upgraded and have</span> <span data-start="1055.77" data-end="1057.84">to upgrade the components who are using</span> <span data-start="1057.84" data-end="1058.47">this boilerplate</span> <span data-start="1058.47" data-end="1060.84">you can use this package called update</span> <span data-start="1060.84" data-end="1061.98">yeoman generator</span> <span data-start="1061.98" data-end="1066.03">it's pretty fun it just is solid in that</span> <span data-start="1066.03" data-end="1068.67">case is globally go to your component</span> <span data-start="1068.67" data-end="1071.97">folder and around the common and when</span> <span data-start="1071.97" data-end="1076.31">you read this comment it will be updated</span> <span data-start="1076.31" data-end="1080.61">magic that's what we like don't repeat</span> <span data-start="1080.61" data-end="1085.89">yourself and other thing that you can</span> <span data-start="1085.89" data-end="1088.2">have some benefits using this</span> <span data-start="1088.2" data-end="1091.71">architecture is you have a lot of firing</span> <span data-start="1091.71" data-end="1093.77">validations let's think about it like</span> <span data-start="1093.77" data-end="1096.72">first of all when you doing a bundle</span> <span data-start="1096.72" data-end="1099.99">when you do a deployment you had to burn</span> <span data-start="1099.99" data-end="1102.51">create a build bundle file for your</span> <span data-start="1102.51" data-end="1105.27">vendors or your page one you're paid to</span> <span data-start="1105.27" data-end="1107.22">sometimes we just put up there together</span> <span data-start="1107.22" data-end="1110.25">we talk about application long years ago</span> <span data-start="1110.25" data-end="1113.04">and now you can have different</span> <span data-start="1113.04" data-end="1115.58">approaches like now have different pages</span> <span data-start="1115.58" data-end="1119.34">you can create specific files for the</span> <span data-start="1119.34" data-end="1123.18">page one page two page three and when</span> <span data-start="1123.18" data-end="1124.71">you have in validations instead of</span> <span data-start="1124.71" data-end="1127.98">having validations for the specific</span> <span data-start="1127.98" data-end="1129.75">vendor you can have for the specific</span> <span data-start="1129.75" data-end="1132.17">file when we talk about validations USA</span> <span data-start="1132.17" data-end="1135.03">is a different files and you fire your</span> <span data-start="1135.03" data-end="1139.19">browser need to download anymore again</span> <span data-start="1139.19" data-end="1143.97">if you don't know more about it Sam did</span> <span data-start="1143.97" data-end="1147.75">a really really good talk and at chrome</span> <span data-start="1147.75" data-end="1149.82">dev summit last year about the future</span> <span data-start="1149.82" data-end="1153.03">the future of loading or web which</span> <span data-start="1153.03" data-end="1155.13">pretty interesting talk about this and</span> <span data-start="1155.13" data-end="1158.22">other points and how the web platform is</span> <span data-start="1158.22" data-end="1164.7">evolving to help all of us so we have a</span> <span data-start="1164.7" data-end="1167.46">checklist from China Kentucky right now</span> <span data-start="1167.46" data-end="1170.64">is great so we have volved the</span> <span data-start="1170.64" data-end="1173.94">application and we are happy with this</span> <span data-start="1173.94" data-end="1178.56">and its component based as we saw a lot</span> <span data-start="1178.56" data-end="1181.38">of applications the market is using a</span> <span data-start="1181.38" data-end="1183.36">component based application its web</span> <span data-start="1183.36" data-end="1187.56">friendly so every single developer who</span> <span data-start="1187.56" data-end="1189.75">is using that has the whole knowledge</span> <span data-start="1189.75" data-end="1192.6">and can use all the power of the web</span> <span data-start="1192.6" data-end="1194.45">platform</span> <span data-start="1194.45" data-end="1198.77">it's mind-blowing like we'll talk about</span> <span data-start="1198.77" data-end="1201.95">one thing that we had a real really</span> <span data-start="1201.95" data-end="1203.45">application that we had ten years ago</span> <span data-start="1203.45" data-end="1206.12">and now we let's talk a brand new</span> <span data-start="1206.12" data-end="1209.36">architecture it was validated we had all</span> <span data-start="1209.36" data-end="1214.01">the steps it's a production and metrics</span> <span data-start="1214.01" data-end="1218.84">but metrics pretty much everywhere after</span> <span data-start="1218.84" data-end="1222.62">you just deployed the first page you</span> <span data-start="1222.62" data-end="1224.66">think okay the first page done let's</span> <span data-start="1224.66" data-end="1227.36">keep the flow let's create some metrics</span> <span data-start="1227.36" data-end="1230.15">to validate and those much kusa can be a</span> <span data-start="1230.15" data-end="1232.79">mix of combinations can be a usual</span> <span data-start="1232.79" data-end="1236.06">conversion can be errors errors that you</span> <span data-start="1236.06" data-end="1238.6">have in that page you can create your</span> <span data-start="1238.6" data-end="1242.35">what makes sense for your application</span> <span data-start="1242.35" data-end="1246.26">there is one just one example screenshot</span> <span data-start="1246.26" data-end="1248.9">of a platform called New Relic so you</span> <span data-start="1248.9" data-end="1250.97">can just go there and do some searched</span> <span data-start="1250.97" data-end="1257.6">and create your your visualization for</span> <span data-start="1257.6" data-end="1261.02">that data and start to see hey this just</span> <span data-start="1261.02" data-end="1263.72">increased a little bit probably we're</span> <span data-start="1263.72" data-end="1266">having memory leak we can work on that</span> <span data-start="1266" data-end="1268.94">or okay it was it they use the</span> <span data-start="1268.94" data-end="1270.53">conversion just increased that's really</span> <span data-start="1270.53" data-end="1272.6">good let's start work at that new relic</span> <span data-start="1272.6" data-end="1274.64">is just example you can use a lot of</span> <span data-start="1274.64" data-end="1277.33">them for example Google tag manager and</span> <span data-start="1277.33" data-end="1283.73">adopted manager and all of them all</span> <span data-start="1283.73" data-end="1288.79">those steps are related to one thing</span> <span data-start="1288.79" data-end="1292.58">release early release often when you</span> <span data-start="1292.58" data-end="1295.4">have only one page you don't need to do</span> <span data-start="1295.4" data-end="1297.43">a deployment for the whole application</span> <span data-start="1297.43" data-end="1301.07">what that means things can have full</span> <span data-start="1301.07" data-end="1304.67">ownership of that thing at that code</span> <span data-start="1304.67" data-end="1308.18">that that behavior usually they should</span> <span data-start="1308.18" data-end="1309.95">have since since the beginning but</span> <span data-start="1309.95" data-end="1311.66">sometimes I thought something happened</span> <span data-start="1311.66" data-end="1313.85">in the mirror of the process and they</span> <span data-start="1313.85" data-end="1318.94">just lost this truck and release early</span> <span data-start="1318.94" data-end="1321.44">you have something you can easily</span> <span data-start="1321.44" data-end="1325.07">validate ship the production or ship and</span> <span data-start="1325.07" data-end="1327.32">other environments before do some</span> <span data-start="1327.32"
