data-end="343.949">you are that's crazy but cool so let's</span> <span data-start="343.949" data-end="345.81">just think about what we're trying to</span> <span data-start="345.81" data-end="349.77">communicate when we're doing stuff um so</span> <span data-start="349.77" data-end="351.479">let's go over the basics I'm going to</span> <span data-start="351.479" data-end="353.639">give you a couple tips just to keep in</span> <span data-start="353.639" data-end="355.83">mind while you're designing stuff while</span> <span data-start="355.83" data-end="358.71">you're building web applications on the</span> <span data-start="358.71" data-end="361.47">front end side of the user facing side</span> <span data-start="361.47" data-end="363.99">these will be tips that you can write</span> <span data-start="363.99" data-end="366.47">down and just think about these are good</span> <span data-start="366.47" data-end="368.34">conversational elements to have with</span> <span data-start="368.34" data-end="370.289">your designers please push back on your</span> <span data-start="370.289" data-end="371.97">designers they'll probably hate me for</span> <span data-start="371.97" data-end="374.58">telling you about this but um they want</span> <span data-start="374.58" data-end="377.13">to be pushed just like you want to push</span> <span data-start="377.13" data-end="379.8">them up in your code reviews and all</span> <span data-start="379.8" data-end="382.68">that stuff so the basics number one</span> <span data-start="382.68" data-end="385.409">hierarchy this is a really important</span> <span data-start="385.409" data-end="388.32">thing when a user comes to your page and</span> <span data-start="388.32" data-end="390.27">they don't know what to click what are</span> <span data-start="390.27" data-end="393.27">you supposed to do so the thing I tell</span> <span data-start="393.27" data-end="394.8">people is you want to pick out out</span> <span data-start="394.8" data-end="396.75">number one on number two and a number</span> <span data-start="396.75" data-end="398.88">three so what's the most important thing</span> <span data-start="398.88" data-end="401.009">on the page it should be the most</span> <span data-start="401.009" data-end="402.3">obvious thing that's your number one</span> <span data-start="402.3" data-end="405.36">number two it should be obvious that</span> <span data-start="405.36" data-end="407.219">it's a number two so we'll go through an</span> <span data-start="407.219" data-end="409.289">example a good way to tell this is a</span> <span data-start="409.289" data-end="411.36">squint test I'm kind of doing it for you</span> <span data-start="411.36" data-end="413.52">blurring it so you can see the top</span> <span data-start="413.52" data-end="416.46">example it has just this basic block of</span> <span data-start="416.46" data-end="419.759">text when you squint your eyes and you</span> <span data-start="419.759" data-end="421.229">look over at the right it's kind of just</span> <span data-start="421.229" data-end="422.849">blurring together at the user doesn't</span> <span data-start="422.849" data-end="424.139">really know what's more important</span> <span data-start="424.139" data-end="426.659">information so they don't know how to</span> <span data-start="426.659" data-end="428.399">make a decision based on that if you go</span> <span data-start="428.399" data-end="432.389">to the bottom we've bolded the text for</span> <span data-start="432.389" data-end="434.309">the headline eat more vegetables and</span> <span data-start="434.309" data-end="436.529">we've put a button we've made the call</span> <span data-start="436.529" data-end="438.33">to action sign up button a bit more</span> <span data-start="438.33" data-end="439.86">important so that's the second most</span> <span data-start="439.86" data-end="441.479">important thing on the element and then</span> <span data-start="441.479" data-end="444.479">there's display text to help reinforce</span> <span data-start="444.479" data-end="446.279">that but that's a good thing to keep in</span> <span data-start="446.279" data-end="448.02">mind when you're doing things just make</span> <span data-start="448.02" data-end="451.169">things hierarchy make the most important</span> <span data-start="451.169" data-end="453.99">things obvious and then go from there um</span> <span data-start="453.99" data-end="457.499">balance is another thing sometimes you</span> <span data-start="457.499" data-end="459.089">go to a web page and it can be all</span> <span data-start="459.089" data-end="460.77">everything's on the left-hand side and</span> <span data-start="460.77" data-end="463.139">there's some input like important</span> <span data-start="463.139" data-end="466.62">information out hanging out but it looks</span> <span data-start="466.62" data-end="468.089">like it's going to fall over so this</span> <span data-start="468.089" data-end="470.43">example is we have a line straight down</span> <span data-start="470.43" data-end="472.74">the middle of this page this line is</span> <span data-start="472.74" data-end="476.43">dividing the white block in half but on</span> <span data-start="476.43" data-end="478.979">the the left-hand example the big blue</span> <span data-start="478.979" data-end="480.93">block is like taking up so much space</span> <span data-start="480.93" data-end="483.24">and it's dominating it so it's making</span> <span data-start="483.24" data-end="484.439">everything feel like it's going to shift</span> <span data-start="484.439" data-end="487.86">over to the left now to offset that on</span> <span data-start="487.86" data-end="490.949">the right hand example um a trick you</span> <span data-start="490.949" data-end="493.529">can do is kind of move the little guys</span> <span data-start="493.529" data-end="496.649">away so it's creating the illusion of</span> <span data-start="496.649" data-end="500.569">tier I that everything is more centered</span> <span data-start="500.569" data-end="503.37">contrasts now contrast is another</span> <span data-start="503.37" data-end="505.259">important thing this goes with hierarchy</span> <span data-start="505.259" data-end="508.349">and all I mean it's it's definitely a</span> <span data-start="508.349" data-end="510.419">friend of hierarchy it's going to help</span> <span data-start="510.419" data-end="513.229">you make things more hierarchical the</span> <span data-start="513.229" data-end="515.94">hierarchical and it's going to help</span> <span data-start="515.94" data-end="517.769">users to understand what you're trying</span> <span data-start="517.769" data-end="520.38">to get them to do a great example of</span> <span data-start="520.38" data-end="524.339">this is of the Spotify screenshot so the</span> <span data-start="524.339" data-end="526.29">most high contrast thing you see on the</span> <span data-start="526.29" data-end="527.76">page the first thing you see is that</span> <span data-start="527.76" data-end="530.1">green button gets Spotify in the top</span> <span data-start="530.1" data-end="531.66">right-hand corner that's an obvious</span> <span data-start="531.66" data-end="534.15">statement everything else on the page is</span> <span data-start="534.15" data-end="536.22">thing to it but really Spotify wants you</span> <span data-start="536.22" data-end="538.62">to get the app so just click that that's</span> <span data-start="538.62" data-end="539.88">pretty much what they're telling you to</span> <span data-start="539.88" data-end="543.87">do so the most obvious user action on</span> <span data-start="543.87"

them but the reason</span> <span data-start="653.94" data-end="656.49">you want to keep stuff really aligned is</span> <span data-start="656.49" data-end="659.4">because you want the users I to be to</span> <span data-start="659.4" data-end="661.32">scroll down to the page so this creates</span> <span data-start="661.32" data-end="663.87">a visual line for the user to scroll</span> <span

data-end="680.34">intentional things should be consistent</span> <span data-start="680.34" data-end="682.38">in this presentation you've seen i'm</span> <span data-start="682.38" data-end="684.81">using and and there's a gray area for</span> <span data-start="684.81" data-end="686.07">that but it's like you should have a</span> <span data-start="686.07" data-end="688.29">basic idea of how you want things to</span> <span data-start="688.29" data-end="690.24">flow i have i've used a couple different</span> <span data-start="690.24" data-end="692.43">colors i have a couple different fonts</span> <span data-start="692.43" data-end="694.26">but everything I'm doing I'm trying to</span> <span data-start="694.26" data-end="697.47">keep consistent so if you add a new UI</span> <span data-start="697.47" data-end="700.92">element it should go along with the rest</span> <span data-start="700.92" data-end="703.02">of your brand so if you've if you have</span> <span data-start="703.02" data-end="704.97">added something to the front of your</span> <span data-start="704.97" data-end="707.4">site and you have say you're all your</span> <span data-start="707.4" data-end="709.26">buttons are styled and then you throw in</span> <span data-start="709.26" data-end="711.63">a new button and it's a default browser</span> <span data-start="711.63" data-end="713.19">button then the user is not going to</span> <span data-start="713.19" data-end="714.51">become it's they're going to be a little</span> <span data-start="714.51" data-end="716.31">confused they might not trust your app</span> <span data-start="716.31" data-end="718.8">quite as much so just being intentional</span> <span data-start="718.8" data-end="720.9">about the little things is going to</span> <span data-start="720.9" data-end="722.54">really set you apart and bring some</span> <span data-start="722.54" data-end="725.4">clarity and trust to everything you do</span> <span data-start="725.4" data-end="727.77">this is just an example you can go</span> <span data-start="727.77" data-end="729.99">online there's tons of UI libraries and</span> <span data-start="729.99" data-end="732.33">stuff that you can pull apart you know</span> <span data-start="732.33" data-end="733.95">you all know bootstrap and stuff</span> <span data-start="733.95" data-end="737.82">bootstraps great um but I want to help</span> <span data-start="737.82" data-end="740.13">you guys understand bootstrap a little</span> <span data-start="740.13" data-end="741.57">bit more so you can make bootstrap a</span> <span data-start="741.57" data-end="743.64">little boot less bootstrap II and more</span> <span data-start="743.64" data-end="747.45">custom to what you want so let's go</span> <span data-start="747.45" data-end="749.55">through some of these points and let's</span> <span data-start="749.55" data-end="752.61">go through and make a little widget okay</span> <span data-start="752.61" data-end="754.02">so we're going to go through everything</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="754.02" data-end="757.71">I've talked about so far and we're going</span> <span data-start="757.71" data-end="759.96">to talk about it so number one here's</span> <span data-start="759.96" data-end="762.81">our little silly little widget where are</span> <span data-start="762.81" data-end="764.4">you from help us customize your</span> <span data-start="764.4" data-end="765.93">experience and then a little drop-down</span> <span data-start="765.93" data-end="768.15">menu with a submit button so we're just</span> <span data-start="768.15" data-end="771.54">going to start off bit by bit point by</span> <span data-start="771.54" data-end="773.49">point and let's go through and tighten</span> <span data-start="773.49" data-end="776.4">this up a little bit more visually so</span> <span data-start="776.4" data-end="777.9">hierarchy we talked about hierarchy</span> <span data-start="777.9" data-end="779.61">first the first thing we're going to do</span> <span data-start="779.61" data-end="783.21">is okay let's increase the size of the</span> <span data-start="783.21" data-end="785.25">question the main question we're asking</span> <span data-start="785.25" data-end="786.78">the user that should be the first thing</span> <span data-start="786.78" data-end="787.95">like they need to know what they're</span> <span data-start="787.95" data-end="791.55">getting into that helper tests isn't the</span> <span data-start="791.55" data-end="793.5">help us customize your experience isn't</span> <span data-start="793.5" data-end="796.68">super important um it could be but we're</span> <span data-start="796.68" data-end="799.67">going to bring down the point size so</span> <span data-start="799.67" data-end="801.36">separating the</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="804.089">headline and the helper text is going to</span> <span data-start="804.089" data-end="808.26">help us create hierarchy number two is</span> <span data-start="808.26" data-end="811.62">balance okay so you can see and I'm</span> <span data-start="811.62" data-end="814.5">going left is the previous widget and</span> <span data-start="814.5" data-end="817.14">right is what we're updating so it's a</span> <span data-start="817.14" data-end="818.85">little unbalanced everything shifted</span> <span data-start="818.85" data-end="821.1">over to the right or to the left hand</span> <span data-start="821.1" data-end="823.29">side on the left hand widget and it's it</span> <span data-start="823.29" data-end="825.5">just seems a little sloppy unintentional</span> <span data-start="825.5" data-end="827.79">so this will bring in tension year</span> <span data-start="827.79" data-end="829.23">design so you want everything to feel</span> <span data-start="829.23" data-end="831.12">balanced let's Center everything put it</span> <span data-start="831.12" data-end="834.329">in the middle and make sense contrast</span> <span data-start="834.329" data-end="836.69">okay well let's make it a little bit</span> <span data-start="836.69" data-end="839.55">let's increase the hierarchy let's make</span> <span data-start="839.55" data-end="841.079">things a little bit more apparent what</span> <span data-start="841.079" data-end="843.87">we want the user to do so we we made the</span> <span data-start="843.87" data-end="846.089">submit button green added more contrast</span> <span data-start="846.089" data-end="848.76">to it obvious that we want them to click</span> <span data-start="848.76" data-end="851.01">and we took down the contrast of the</span> <span data-start="851.01" data-end="852.839">help us customize this experience</span> <span data-start="852.839" data-end="854.85">because it's still not that important so</span> <span data-start="854.85" data-end="856.56">we're we're going to tone it back even</span> <span data-start="856.56" data-end="860.16">more so contrast will help us build even</span> <span data-start="860.16" data-end="863.85">more hierarchy white space okay so this</span> <span data-start="863.85" data-end="865.86">text is feeling a little this widgets</span> <span data-start="865.86" data-end="867.149">feeling a little crammed and we have</span> <span data-start="867.149" data-end="869.61">plenty room of room on this page to add</span> <span data-start="869.61" data-end="871.89">some white space so we opened up the</span> <span data-start="871.89" data-end="875.25">padding on the sides we gave the submit</span> <span data-start="875.25" data-end="877.32">button a little bit more padding so it's</span> <span data-start="877.32" data-end="880.05">even more of a call to action and it</span> <span data-start="880.05" data-end="882.69">makes sense but when we did that we are</span> <span data-start="882.69" data-end="886.35">we did we forgot to align our the</span> <span data-start="886.35" data-end="888.66">drop-down menu with the submit button so</span> <span data-start="888.66" data-end="890.43">that's something that on the left hand</span> <span data-start="890.43" data-end="893.13">side it looks kind of like a mistake but</span> <span data-start="893.13" data-end="894.48">if you put it in a little bit more</span> <span data-start="894.48" data-end="896.37">effort you have those things align</span> <span data-start="896.37" data-end="898.29">that's the polish that it's going to</span> <span data-start="898.29" data-end="900.57">make your users just appreciate little</span> <span data-start="900.57" data-end="902.519">things and add a little bit of trust to</span> <span data-start="902.519" data-end="906.089">what you're doing um consistency now</span> <span data-start="906.089" data-end="907.829">this would be this one might be a little</span> <span data-start="907.829" data-end="910.38">bit hard for for some people to pick up</span> <span data-start="910.38" data-end="911.94">but it's just something to train your</span> <span data-start="911.94" data-end="913.86">eye to look for the inconsistent thing</span> <span data-start="913.86" data-end="917.07">here is the fonts and this is where I</span> <span data-start="917.07" data-end="918.779">might lose you a little bit but I hope I</span> <span data-start="918.779" data-end="920.399">keep you is it the fonts in the</span> <span data-start="920.399" data-end="922.019">drop-down menu and the fonts and the</span> <span data-start="922.019" data-end="925.17">submit button are different than the</span> <span data-start="925.17" data-end="927.899">other fonts on the left hand side so</span> <span data-start="927.899" data-end="930.81">it's it's a small nuance but if you can</span> <span data-start="930.81" data-end="932.49">start picking up on those things and</span> <span data-start="932.49" data-end="934.32">like I just have a</span> <span data-start="934.32" data-end="936.33">fault font on the left

hell</span> <span data-start="940.26" data-end="942.36">vatika because it's more intentional</span> <span data-start="942.36" data-end="946.92">it's an intentional decision um so we</span> <span data-start="946.92" data-end="949.17">have a before and after shot now this is</span> <span data-start="949.17" data-end="952.32">like this is pretty big difference in my</span> <span data-start="952.32" data-end="956.37">eyes as a user or as a designer um these</span> <span data-start="956.37" data-end="959.13">are small updates that we made there</span> <span data-start="959.13"
