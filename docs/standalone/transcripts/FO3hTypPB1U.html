<p><span data-start="62.95" data-end="65.57">I thought this was a good metaphor for</span> <span data-start="65.57" data-end="67.64">web development because even though it's</span> <span data-start="67.64" data-end="70.04">it's it's shouted I can still use it</span> <span data-start="70.04" data-end="74.06">like it still works so in the way the</span> <span data-start="74.06" data-end="76.189">way the web is is is it's completely</span> <span data-start="76.189" data-end="80.38">unstructured and everything you do is</span> <span data-start="80.38" data-end="83.78">through

data-start="93.56" data-end="97.069">things messing up and it's almost like</span> <span data-start="97.069" data-end="100.219">you know you are in to go into a room a</span> <span

data-end="116.539">with web components is a way to get a</span> <span data-start="116.539" data-end="118.789">dustbin to sweep off the brick broken</span> <span data-start="118.789" data-end="120.77">glass and then you know you make your</span> <span data-start="120.77" data-end="122.389">merry way around the room get the</span> <span data-start="122.389" data-end="124.009">diamonds as and when you feel like it or</span> <span data-start="124.009" data-end="126.319">in the case of my iphone it would be the</span> <span data-start="126.319" data-end="127.999">thirty dollar screen replacement that</span> <span data-start="127.999" data-end="130.52">you would hopefully get to replace your</span> <span data-start="130.52" data-end="132.47">iphone screen with and start using the</span> <span data-start="132.47" data-end="135.709">iphone as it was before so with that</span> <span data-start="135.709" data-end="138.319">introduction to web components first</span> <span data-start="138.319" data-end="140.3">thing that you should know is can I use</span> <span data-start="140.3" data-end="143.269">is definitely no please do not use it</span> <span data-start="143.269" data-end="147.409">ever for now but please experiment with</span> <span data-start="147.409" data-end="148.94">it like can i experiment yes</span> <span data-start="148.94" data-end="151.16">always please do that and what you</span> <span data-start="151.16" data-end="153.47">should be doing is experiment with it</span> <span data-start="153.47" data-end="155.99">give feedback to the speculators maybe</span> <span data-start="155.99" data-end="157.79">write something with it see how your</span> <span data-start="157.79" data-end="159.47">existing competence can port over to</span> <span data-start="159.47" data-end="161.63">this web conference back and basically</span> <span data-start="161.63" data-end="164">make sure that it does not suck because</span> <span data-start="164" data-end="166.22">a lot of current web api is sucked big</span> <span data-start="166.22" data-end="168.92">time so we don't want to replicate that</span> <span data-start="168.92" data-end="170.99">kind of error again with something as</span> <span data-start="170.99" data-end="173.78">big and as encompassing as web component</span> <span data-start="173.78" data-end="178.31">specifications so first thing to notice</span> <span data-start="178.31" data-end="180.62">it's chrome only and it's not even like</span> <span data-start="180.62" data-end="182.51">a web kid only thing it's a chrome only</span> <span data-start="182.51" data-end="184">thing it's also very hard to debug</span> <span data-start="184" data-end="185.93">because especially because you have</span> <span data-start="185.93" data-end="188.06">separating concerns that is different</span> <span data-start="188.06" data-end="189.65">components in different pages and</span> <span data-start="189.65" data-end="192.11">different files so if you're still</span> <span data-start="192.11" data-end="193.91">interested the way you would go forward</span> <span data-start="193.91" data-end="197.6">is enable flags in Chrome Canary so</span> <span data-start="197.6" data-end="200.24">first there's a flag called experimental</span> <span data-start="200.24" data-end="202.31">support for WebKit experiments and that</span> <span data-start="202.31" data-end="204.17">would give you shadow Dom that would</span> <span data-start="204.17" data-end="206.45">give you CSS variables that will give</span> <span data-start="206.45" data-end="208.73">you CSIS regions and there's also</span> <span data-start="208.73" data-end="211.91">another flag for CSIS shaders which I'll</span> <span data-start="211.91" data-end="214.459">talk about so enabling these two flags</span> <span data-start="214.459" data-end="215.72">will give you everything that you need</span> <span data-start="215.72" data-end="218.57">to follow along with this talk and then</span> <span data-start="218.57" data-end="220.94">if you are doing tellapur tools you do</span> <span data-start="220.94" data-end="223.43">want to you know be sane so to do that</span> <span data-start="223.43" data-end="225.89">you have to enable show shadow DOM and</span> <span data-start="225.89" data-end="228.89">then Angelina talked about the polyfill</span> <span data-start="228.89" data-end="230.57">that we'll be using and this is the</span> <span data-start="230.57" data-end="232.34">polyfill that exactly replicates the</span> <span data-start="232.34" data-end="235.67">spec that encompasses well the bunch of</span> <span data-start="235.67" data-end="238.55">specs that composes the web components</span> <span data-start="238.55" data-end="241.07">specifications and so it has all the</span> <span data-start="241.07" data-end="242.72">api's and everything that is necessary</span> <span data-start="242.72" data-end="246.41">to start using the spec at least as an</span> <span data-start="246.41" data-end="252.05">experiment so the essentials of web</span> <span data-start="252.05" data-end="253.4">components that are like for</span> <span data-start="253.4" data-end="255.35">specifications that form the part of the</span> <span data-start="255.35" data-end="257.87">web competence spec and there's one that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="257.87" data-end="259.7">I'm never gonna talk about because I</span> <span data-start="259.7" data-end="262.1">completely hate it and it's called the</span> <span data-start="262.1" data-end="263.99">decorators please never talk of it again</span> <span data-start="263.99" data-end="265.49">and hopefully if you're giving feedback</span> <span data-start="265.49" data-end="267.59">tell them that you hate it too but if</span> <span data-start="267.59" data-end="269.39">you really like it or if you won't find</span> <span data-start="269.39" data-end="270.86">out more about it just google for</span> <span data-start="270.86" data-end="272.24">decorators web components you'll find</span> <span data-start="272.24" data-end="275">information about it but the first thing</span> <span data-start="275" data-end="277.34">that's part of the web conference pack</span> <span data-start="277.34" data-end="279.47">is the shadow DOM and you've heard</span> <span data-start="279.47" data-end="281.03">enough of it so I'm not going to bother</span> <span data-start="281.03" data-end="282.8">telling you what it is</span> <span data-start="282.8" data-end="285.49">then you have the custom elements and</span> <span data-start="285.49" data-end="287.69">one thing to notice all of these</span> <span data-start="287.69" data-end="289.43">specifications can be used on their own</span> <span data-start="289.43" data-end="291.11">like you don't have to use them all</span> <span data-start="291.11" data-end="292.22">together you can use them separately</span> <span data-start="292.22" data-end="294.919">they all have their own benefits so the</span> <span data-start="294.919" data-end="296.69">way you'd use a custom element is you</span> <span data-start="296.69" data-end="298.909">have an element and then you would</span> <span data-start="298.909" data-end="301.58">extend a native HTML tag that most</span> <span data-start="301.58" data-end="303.74">closely matches the custom element that</span> <span data-start="303.74" data-end="305.449">you're going to use and then you have a</span> <span data-start="305.449" data-end="307.129">name and then you put a bunch of HTML</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="307.129" data-end="311.599">CSS script whatnot so and the way you</span> <span data-start="311.599" data-end="314.479">would use it is you will have this same</span> <span data-start="314.479" data-end="317.09">HTML tag that you used in the extent</span> <span data-start="317.09" data-end="320.06">attribute value and then say is that</span> <span data-start="320.06" data-end="322.639">custom element and you can't use so here</span> <span data-start="322.639" data-end="325.009">in this example I have a button so in</span> <span data-start="325.009" data-end="332.96">the definition I had where it oh so in</span> <span data-start="332.96" data-end="335.21">the definition I had extends button so i</span> <span data-start="335.21" data-end="337.34">have to use a button tie here I can't</span> <span data-start="337.34" data-end="338.84">use the div or a span or anything like</span> <span data-start="338.84" data-end="344.09">that so then you have templates so</span> <span data-start="344.09" data-end="345.409">templates again can be used on their own</span> <span data-start="345.409" data-end="347.779">so I'd use a template tag and then you'd</span> <span data-start="347.779" data-end="349.37">put content within the content tagged</span> <span data-start="349.37" data-end="352.49">and as Angelina said you use the Select</span> <span data-start="352.49" data-end="354.409">attribute to select the kind of content</span> <span data-start="354.409" data-end="355.69">that will form the part of the template</span> <span data-start="355.69" data-end="360.469">so let's look at an example so this is</span> <span data-start="360.469" data-end="363.71">example of how web components would work</span> <span data-start="363.71" data-end="366.169">so if you notice the mark up you have</span> <span data-start="366.169" data-end="368.419">just two buttons and they say click me</span> <span data-start="368.419" data-end="371.24">click me the same but one of the buttons</span> <span data-start="371.24" data-end="373.039">has the east attribute of one doesn't</span> <span data-start="373.039" data-end="375.979">and the nature of HTML buttons is that</span> <span data-start="375.979" data-end="378.11">they do nothing until you associate an</span> <span data-start="378.11" data-end="381.5">action with them so here it appears like</span> <span data-start="381.5" data-end="383.18">they have both buttons which in which</span> <span data-start="383.18" data-end="384.949">case they should both do nothing like</span> <span data-start="384.949" data-end="387.08">when I click on this click me nothing</span> <span data-start="387.08" data-end="389.12">happens which is rather that's exactly</span> <span data-start="389.12" data-end="391.52">how what you look like but in this click</span> <span data-start="391.52" data-end="393.199">me you notice first of all there's an</span> <span data-start="393.199" data-end="395.479">ascii character which typically you</span> <span data-start="395.479" data-end="397.43">would not expect to have but it's a</span> <span data-start="397.43" data-end="399.86">custom element so when I click it I have</span> <span data-start="399.86" data-end="403.039">a statement stuff you know it's a good</span> <span data-start="403.039" data-end="407.09">stress release but so the reason why we</span> <span data-start="407.09" data-end="409.219">do this is how it happens is first you</span> <span data-start="409.219" data-end="411.529">have the link rel is equal to components</span> <span data-start="411.529" data-end="413.69">and I have the components in this file</span> <span data-start="413.69" data-end="416.63">so if you go to that</span> <span data-start="416.63" data-end="421.43">opponent I have an element and then I</span> <span data-start="421.43" data-end="423.47">have name and then I have the template</span> <span data-start="423.47" data-end="425.48">and whatever us within the template</span> <span data-start="425.48" data-end="428.36">becomes part of that new instance of</span> <span data-start="428.36" data-end="429.65">that new custom element that just</span> <span data-start="429.65" data-end="433.13">created and I have a span we look into</span> <span data-start="433.13" data-end="434.54">the variable a little bit later then i</span> <span data-start="434.54" data-end="437.63">have that ascii character and then again</span> <span data-start="437.63" data-end="440.15">where I'm putting this content and then</span> <span data-start="440.15" data-end="441.29">this is the script that's getting</span> <span data-start="441.29" data-end="443.42">triggered if you notice I don't just</span> <span data-start="443.42" data-end="445.79">simply have this doggone click is equal</span> <span data-start="445.79" data-end="447.98">to function that will not fly because</span> <span data-start="447.98" data-end="450.41">this script least run every time that</span> <span data-start="450.41" data-end="452.42">shadow Dom has been instantiated so</span> <span data-start="452.42" data-end="455.12">there's a lifecycle API that you can use</span> <span data-start="455.12" data-end="457.76">and then you can save which functions</span> <span data-start="457.76"
