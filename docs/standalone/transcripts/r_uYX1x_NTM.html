based in browsers and a mobile</span> <span data-start="92.18" data-end="93.92">devices and we're built on something</span> <span data-start="93.92" data-end="98.36">called web RTC and we provide what is</span> <span data-start="98.36" data-end="100.31">sort of a different user experience and</span> <span data-start="100.31" data-end="101.9">a different approach to video chatting</span> <span

data-end="126.5">just works this is sort of a showcase of</span> <span data-start="126.5" data-end="132.04">the power of the web just let this work</span> <span data-start="132.04" data-end="138.74">and we launched back in 2013 as the</span> <span data-start="138.74" data-end="141.29">first sort of commercial product based</span> <span data-start="141.29" data-end="141.95">on this so we</span> <span data-start="141.95" data-end="143.66">then having subtraction and learned a</span> <span data-start="143.66" data-end="145.76">lot about what it means to actually</span> <span data-start="145.76" data-end="150.56">build products but it all started with</span> <span data-start="150.56" data-end="153.44">the interns as many projects do so we</span> <span data-start="153.44" data-end="156.26">were once like an R&D company inside a</span> <span data-start="156.26" data-end="158.42">large telecom operator may be doing a</span> <span data-start="158.42" data-end="159.86">lot of communication apps and every</span> <span data-start="159.86" data-end="161.33">summer we would have students from</span> <span data-start="161.33" data-end="163.94">universities that we hired in and we</span> <span data-start="163.94" data-end="165.83">starting to do projects that were sore a</span> <span data-start="165.83" data-end="167.239">little bit cool and like you sort of</span> <span data-start="167.239" data-end="169.19">play around and learn stuff and we were</span> <span data-start="169.19" data-end="171.86">their mentors and we had this idea we</span> <span data-start="171.86" data-end="174.08">know that vibrancy was coming we didn't</span> <span data-start="174.08" data-end="175.7">know a lot about it other than it was</span> <span data-start="175.7" data-end="180.349">for peer-to-peer video we wanted to see</span> <span data-start="180.349" data-end="181.91">what we can create with it in addition</span> <span data-start="181.91" data-end="185.599">we've had a lot of problems with getting</span> <span data-start="185.599" data-end="187.43">us a nose to work I mean we spent 10</span> <span data-start="187.43" data-end="189.739">minutes every day trying to just get the</span> <span data-start="189.739" data-end="192.19">damn thing to work that's very annoying</span> <span data-start="192.19" data-end="194.59">that is idea that what if it could work</span> <span data-start="194.59" data-end="197.06">with you just sending a link to someone</span> <span data-start="197.06" data-end="198.92">and then it just magically worked the</span> <span data-start="198.92" data-end="201.28">link was sort of the room so this week</span> <span data-start="201.28" data-end="203.66">so we had three students and we had six</span> <span data-start="203.66" data-end="206.989">weeks and we have this idea and it was a</span> <span data-start="206.989" data-end="214.91">very ambitious project but the dynastar</span> <span data-start="214.91" data-end="216.769">feel free to choose the technology such</span> <span data-start="216.769" data-end="218.87">as how the service looked and how they</span> <span data-start="218.87" data-end="222.01">worked after two weeks we have our first</span> <span data-start="222.01" data-end="225.859">demo so he assumes sort of shaking and</span> <span data-start="225.859" data-end="227.18">we're very ashamed of the things that</span> <span data-start="227.18" data-end="231.26">are created they showed up there in</span> <span data-start="231.26" data-end="233.9">front of like 50 people most of them</span> <span data-start="233.9" data-end="236.569">engineers and showed us something quite</span> <span data-start="236.569" data-end="238.79">amazing actually we got our minds blown</span> <span data-start="238.79" data-end="240.38">because they they showed off not only</span> <span data-start="240.38" data-end="242.329">having one to one video communication</span> <span data-start="242.329" data-end="243.59">where pretend made it work for groups</span> <span data-start="243.59" data-end="246.319">and this was so good that during the</span> <span data-start="246.319" data-end="248.06">demo people typing in the URL that we</span> <span data-start="248.06" data-end="249.98">were using and joining the chat as well</span> <span data-start="249.98" data-end="253.28">and this was at least in 2013 this was</span> <span data-start="253.28" data-end="255.47">yeah mind-blowing nobody had seen</span> <span data-start="255.47" data-end="257.359">anything like this before and I worked</span> <span data-start="257.359" data-end="258.95">in chrome stable and later in firefox</span> <span data-start="258.95" data-end="260.989">and off-brand other demos as well or</span> <span data-start="260.989" data-end="263.9">other browsers as well so needs to say</span> <span data-start="263.9" data-end="266.21">excitement was high and was this sort of</span> <span data-start="266.21" data-end="269.45">early demo I sort of got us into the</span> <span data-start="269.45" data-end="270.83">idea this can actually turn into a</span> <span data-start="270.83" data-end="273.409">product so the last four remaining weeks</span> <span data-start="273.409" data-end="275.729">we get them a designer and we get</span> <span data-start="275.729" data-end="278.159">some some more feedback and how he can</span> <span data-start="278.159" data-end="279.389">actually develop this into a product</span> <span data-start="279.389" data-end="281.49">that we launched and I was the initial</span> <span data-start="281.49" data-end="285.439">story of how aperion actually came to</span> <span data-start="285.439" data-end="287.999">and you can recognize a lot from the</span> <span data-start="287.999" data-end="290.009">service that you saw before and to serve</span> <span data-start="290.009" data-end="291.9">the day built after six weeks the video</span> <span data-start="291.9" data-end="293.759">layouts is mostly the same but the</span> <span data-start="293.759" data-end="296.249">colors a bit different now and they're</span> <span data-start="296.249" data-end="300.87">much more functionalities and after the</span> <span data-start="300.87" data-end="303.809">intern perious was finished we decided</span> <span data-start="303.809" data-end="305.759">we should just launched and this is sort</span> <span data-start="305.759" data-end="309.899">of in a telecom industry launchers are</span> <span data-start="309.899" data-end="312.749">measured in millions both in amount of</span> <span data-start="312.749" data-end="314.219">money you spend on how many users you</span> <span data-start="314.219" data-end="315.99">reach but we decided to do something a</span> <span data-start="315.99" data-end="318.99">bit different and we were luck to do</span> <span data-start="318.99" data-end="320.55">that because during summer in Norway</span> <span data-start="320.55" data-end="322.499">there's about this four or five week</span> <span data-start="322.499" data-end="324.12">period of time where all the grown-ups</span> <span data-start="324.12" data-end="327.089">are on holiday basically so nobody's</span> <span data-start="327.089" data-end="329.069">there to tell you I probably shouldn't</span> <span data-start="329.069" data-end="331.05">do this so you wrote a quick blog post</span> <span data-start="331.05" data-end="332.759">you posted it on hacker news and read it</span> <span data-start="332.759" data-end="333.96">because that's how you sort of launch</span> <span data-start="333.96" data-end="336.33">stuff back in the day or probably not as</span> <span data-start="336.33" data-end="339.419">well and the feedback we got was just</span> <span data-start="339.419" data-end="342.209">amazing we got a lot of attention the</span> <span data-start="342.209" data-end="343.979">same reaction that we got in that first</span> <span data-start="343.979" data-end="346.499">initial demo and while our service</span> <span data-start="346.499" data-end="347.819">struggled and there were a lot of things</span> <span data-start="347.819" data-end="350.43">we should have done better and we</span> <span data-start="350.43" data-end="353.55">crashed a lot people in general sort of</span> <span data-start="353.55" data-end="355.139">saw the ID and we saw that this was</span> <span data-start="355.139" data-end="356.459">something that we should really put more</span> <span data-start="356.459" data-end="360.839">focus into that gives me to the first</span> <span data-start="360.839" data-end="362.3">lesson I overheard a conversation</span> <span data-start="362.3" data-end="364.86">earlier today about some guy I don't</span> <span data-start="364.86" data-end="367.02">know his name or wasn't meant to listen</span> <span data-start="367.02" data-end="369.629">to on a conversation or anything but he</span> <span data-start="369.629" data-end="371.159">wanted to launch its open-source project</span> <span data-start="371.159" data-end="373.8">no no no I have to it uses require Jess</span> <span data-start="373.8" data-end="375.24">so I have to do it in something other</span> <span data-start="375.24" data-end="378.029">the other thing and it's have to redo de</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="378.029" data-end="379.889">Pisan that kind stuff that doesn't</span> <span data-start="379.889" data-end="381.389">matter you should just launched early if</span> <span data-start="381.389" data-end="383.249">you aren't a little bit afraid or a</span> <span data-start="383.249" data-end="384.33">little bit ashamed of what you're</span> <span data-start="384.33" data-end="387.33">launching you're watching too late</span> <span data-start="387.33" data-end="389.999">because the best feedback looking yet is</span> <span data-start="389.999" data-end="391.77">that actually someone uses your product</span> <span data-start="391.77" data-end="393.839">they love it and you get motivation from</span> <span data-start="393.839" data-end="395.969">that and you get prioritization what</span> <span data-start="395.969" data-end="397.62">should actually fix instead of just</span> <span data-start="397.62" data-end="400.05">sitting there and sort of coding away</span> <span data-start="400.05" data-end="401.37">and not really know in the direction</span> <span data-start="401.37" data-end="402.87">that you want to go in and unending up</span> <span data-start="402.87" data-end="405.779">never launching and if we haven't</span> <span data-start="405.779" data-end="407.49">launched back then when this was so</span> <span data-start="407.49" data-end="408.81">fresh we might have never been where we</span> <span data-start="408.81" data-end="409.2">are today</span> <span data-start="409.2" data-end="412.17">because we got a lot of attention from</span> <span data-start="412.17" data-end="418.29">being the first mover yeah we had a</span> <span data-start="418.29" data-end="421.59">rocky first few months we were a bit</span> <span data-start="421.59" data-end="423.48">lucky to have another project shut down</span> <span data-start="423.48" data-end="425.07">so we had a lot of engineers to sort of</span> <span data-start="425.07" data-end="426.72">pick and choose from from day one so we</span> <span data-start="426.72" data-end="429.6">set up a small team we had like three</span> <span data-start="429.6" data-end="432.48">redesigns we tried to figure out who we</span> <span data-start="432.48" data-end="434.88">were and what do you want to be until we</span> <span data-start="434.88" data-end="437.31">finally thought that we had it we were</span> <span data-start="437.31" data-end="439.14">going to be the world's biggest web RTC</span> <span data-start="439.14" data-end="446.55">video conferencing service yeah but that</span> <span data-start="446.55" data-end="449.73">doesn't really work and the middle II we</span> <span data-start="449.73" data-end="451.02">did get a lot of positive feedback</span> <span data-start="451.02" data-end="453.33">because we were web RTC based and I was</span> <span data-start="453.33" data-end="458.04">kind of cool and hip at a time and that</span> <span data-start="458.04" data-end="459.72">gave us a lot of buzz and initial</span> <span data-start="459.72" data-end="461.4">attention another blog post i got those</span> <span data-start="461.4" data-end="464.94">users but in the end the truth was that</span> <span data-start="464.94" data-end="467.18">the average user couldn't care less</span> <span

data-end="508.47">preferred us over those other much</span> <span data-start="508.47" data-end="509.91">larger services because you could see</span> <span data-start="509.91" data-end="512.04">that we were getting users we're getting</span> <span data-start="512.04" data-end="513.63">attention outside the fact that it was</span> <span data-start="513.63" data-end="517.74">we're about to see based

data-end="834.119">while we sort of grew out to the coffee</span> <span data-start="834.119" data-end="836.249">shop method and we started hitting more</span> <span data-start="836.249" data-end="839.549">complex problems and that's where you</span> <span data-start="839.549" data-end="842.339">set up sort of a proper user testing</span> <span data-start="842.339"

data-end="877.889">and then come back we sort of this is</span> <span data-start="877.889" data-end="879.449">the way we have to solve it then you</span> <span data-start="879.449" data-end="881.279">lose the perspective of example the</span> <span data-start="881.279" data-end="887.399">designer or the engineer and we make</span> <span data-start="887.399"

data-end="892.769">code we did whatever made sense at the</span> <span data-start="892.769" data-end="895.35">time what took the least effort for us</span> <span data-start="895.35"

data-end="1106.35">this because that was not priority right</span> <span data-start="1106.35" data-end="1112.86">now right then comes another problem</span> <span data-start="1112.86" data-end="1115.08">because once we started doing all of</span> <span data-start="1115.08" data-end="1116.91">this and we started getting it right</span> <span data-start="1116.91" data-end="1119.37">most of the time we started innovating</span> <span data-start="1119.37" data-end="1122.7">way too much what honestly because we</span> <span data-start="1122.7"

data-end="1128.97">change everything at once there were a</span> <span data-start="1128.97" data-end="1130.5">lot of things that we hated with current</span> <span data-start="1130.5"

for example we knew that we need some</span> <span data-start="1139.47" data-end="1142.89">kind of user model but our entire</span> <span data-start="1142.89" data-end="1145.32">tagline for the server

<span data-start="1155.58" data-end="1159.6">access profile that's lot better login</span> <span data-start="1159.6" data-end="1162.27">than anything else we made sure that the</span> <span

data-end="1226.07">button the sort of gets people going</span> <span data-start="1226.07" data-end="1231.24">usually so a lot of people did not end</span> <span data-start="1231.24" data-end="1232.77">up seeing the new stiff stuff that we</span> <span data-start="1232.77" data-end="1235.02">built which means that all the retention</span> <span data-start="1235.02"

data-end="1243.21">seen so I brings us to our next lesson</span> <span data-start="1243.21" data-end="1245.22">keep innovations to a minimum I firmly</span> <span data-start="1245.22" data-end="1247.32">believe that you have innovation points</span> <span data-start="1247.32" data-end="1248.91">that you get to spend for each product</span> <span data-start="1248.91" data-end="1250.41">that you have and once you've done</span> <span data-start="1250.41" data-end="1252.63">spending them then you have to do stuff</span> <span data-start="1252.63" data-end="1256.26">by the book like because users need to</span> <span data-start="1256.26" data-end="1259.98">feel familiar they need something to</span> <span data-start="1259.98" data-end="1261.69">compare this new experience that you're</span> <span data-start="1261.69" data-end="1264.99">giving them this new either way of doing</span> <span data-start="1264.99" data-end="1267.15">things to like and stuff it's something</span> <span data-start="1267.15" data-end="1269.24">that they have experienced before</span> <span data-start="1269.24" data-end="1272.46">otherwise they're going to feel confused</span> <span data-start="1272.46" data-end="1273.96">or you're going to make them feel stupid</span> <span data-start="1273.96" data-end="1276.36">because nobody wants to not get it</span> <span data-start="1276.36" data-end="1278.04">especially if your friends are saying oh</span> <span data-start="1278.04" data-end="1280.11">man this new service is so cool and then</span> <span data-start="1280.11" data-end="1281.76">they start using it and they don't get</span> <span data-start="1281.76" data-end="1284.4">anything and leaving your users feeling</span> <span data-start="1284.4" data-end="1286.23">stupid will ultimately make them leave</span> <span data-start="1286.23" data-end="1290.64">which is not what you want so eventually</span> <span data-start="1290.64" data-end="1292.98">we listened and we made logging and sign</span> <span data-start="1292.98" data-end="1295.44">up the way it was supposed to be and we</span> <span data-start="1295.44" data-end="1297.93">made it a better call to action and we</span> <span data-start="1297.93" data-end="1299.49">went from having two to three support</span> <span data-start="1299.49" data-end="1301.38">cases every day of people asking us</span> <span data-start="1301.38" data-end="1303.51">where do you log in like they've managed</span> <span data-start="1303.51" data-end="1305.1">to claim room but then they've sort of</span> <span data-start="1305.1" data-end="1306.84">switch computers or come to a new device</span> <span data-start="1306.84" data-end="1308.85">and I didn't figure out how to login</span> <span data-start="1308.85" data-end="1310.95">actually because it never said login</span> <span data-start="1310.95" data-end="1312.57">anywhere in our system we made sure of</span> <span data-start="1312.57" data-end="1316.32">that yeah here's someone laughing</span> <span data-start="1316.32" data-end="1319.049">this is a serious thing with it and</span> <span data-start="1319.049" data-end="1320.669">after we changed it we had we haven't</span> <span data-start="1320.669" data-end="1322.799">had a single support case about it in</span> <span data-start="1322.799" data-end="1328.539">eight months and perhaps longer now even</span> <span data-start="1328.549" data-end="1334.22">right it brings us to another lesson</span> <span data-start="1334.22" data-end="1340.08">that is listen for feedback because on a</span> <span data-start="1340.08" data-end="1342.809">real glad sort of the mild side the</span> <span data-start="1342.809" data-end="1344.25">empathy talk because a lot of the</span> <span data-start="1344.25" data-end="1345.929">feedback stuff is about having empathy</span> <span data-start="1345.929" data-end="1347.7">for users understanding and setting</span> <span data-start="1347.7" data-end="1350.82">yourself in their place and understand</span> <span data-start="1350.82" data-end="1352.08">the problems that they have with what</span> <span data-start="1352.08" data-end="1356.19">you're trying to create so you did a lot</span> <span data-start="1356.19" data-end="1357.6">of different things to listen feedback</span> <span data-start="1357.6" data-end="1359.7">the obvious choices are of course having</span> <span data-start="1359.7" data-end="1363.74">a support email or anything like that</span> <span data-start="1363.74" data-end="1366.419">but we also had set up something we call</span> <span data-start="1366.419" data-end="1369.809">the ambassador program which were teens</span> <span data-start="1369.809" data-end="1371.7">that liked our product we used to go out</span> <span data-start="1371.7" data-end="1374.7">and have lectures in schools about</span> <span data-start="1374.7" data-end="1377.1">coding or whatever and then teens that</span> <span data-start="1377.1" data-end="1378.419">were interested in sort of learning more</span> <span data-start="1378.419" data-end="1380.549">or talking to us we made them or abasa</span> <span data-start="1380.549" data-end="1382.08">ders so then we could use them to sort</span> <span data-start="1382.08" data-end="1384.72">of ask hey this new thing that we're</span> <span data-start="1384.72" data-end="1386.129">making does this make sense to you at</span> <span data-start="1386.129" data-end="1388.049">all or for the stickers like what</span> <span data-start="1388.049" data-end="1389.37">sticker should be great to that kind of</span> <span data-start="1389.37" data-end="1392.07">stuff that's also a good way to get and</span> <span data-start="1392.07" data-end="1394.11">listen for feedback is actually finding</span> <span data-start="1394.11" data-end="1396.299">our to users are and then reaching out</span> <span data-start="1396.299" data-end="1398.07">to them and asking hey do you actually</span> <span data-start="1398.07" data-end="1399.779">like our product or how can we make</span> <span data-start="1399.779" data-end="1405.179">stuff better for you but even if you do</span> <span data-start="1405.179" data-end="1406.799">everything right we think you do</span> <span data-start="1406.799" data-end="1410.22">everything right the coded right may</span> <span data-start="1410.22" data-end="1412.799">still break it all and this is a horror</span> <span data-start="1412.799" data-end="1415.559">story from from a time that we we had a</span> <span data-start="1415.559" data-end="1417.389">successful feature it did what if all</span> <span data-start="1417.389" data-end="1419.34">was supposed to do but something went</span> <span data-start="1419.34" data-end="1425.159">horribly horribly wrong so we introduced</span> <span data-start="1425.159" data-end="1428.879">a concept we called following which is</span> <span data-start="1428.879" data-end="1430.47">basically if you get notified when</span> <span data-start="1430.47" data-end="1433.71">someone sends a chat message or joins</span> <span data-start="1433.71" data-end="1435.899">the room or something that the intention</span> <span data-start="1435.899" data-end="1437.97">here was that the user wanted to figure</span> <span data-start="1437.97" data-end="1439.919">out or actually teens wanted to talk to</span> <span data-start="1439.919" data-end="1441.24">her friends and I wanted to know when</span> <span data-start="1441.24" data-end="1443.46">their friends were on the service and</span> <span data-start="1443.46" data-end="1444.57">what they were talking about they had a</span> <span data-start="1444.57" data-end="1447.929">fear of missing out the same was true</span> <span data-start="1447.929" data-end="1449.58">for teams they want to see if their team</span> <span data-start="1449.58" data-end="1450.15">was</span> <span data-start="1450.15" data-end="1454.71">in a stand-up or at a view and we tested</span> <span data-start="1454.71" data-end="1456.5">this well in beforehand we felt that we</span> <span data-start="1456.5" data-end="1461.37">really understood the problem I me of</span> <span data-start="1461.37" data-end="1462.54">course wanted people come back some</span> <span data-start="1462.54" data-end="1464.1">notifications a sort of a very obvious</span> <span data-start="1464.1" data-end="1466.56">way of doing that in a future itself</span> <span data-start="1466.56" data-end="1467.97">that was a success a lot of people</span> <span data-start="1467.97" data-end="1469.5">actually started coming back and they</span> <span data-start="1469.5" data-end="1471.45">used to future do IV we envisioned it</span> <span data-start="1471.45" data-end="1475.86">and the metrics looked good but then we</span> <span data-start="1475.86" data-end="1477.75">started seeing something weird the</span> <span data-start="1477.75" data-end="1479.4">performance of my server was was</span> <span data-start="1479.4" data-end="1481.11">horrible requests were taking more than</span> <span data-start="1481.11" data-end="1484.59">five seconds and this at first wasn't</span> <span data-start="1484.59" data-end="1486.63">very surprising to us because first we</span> <span data-start="1486.63" data-end="1488.85">had a sudden influx of many users the</span> <span data-start="1488.85" data-end="1490.56">teens that starting sparing it to their</span> <span data-start="1490.56" data-end="1492.63">friends and we saw a doubling of user</span> <span data-start="1492.63" data-end="1494.99">numbers and at the time we were running</span> <span data-start="1494.99" data-end="1498.48">a single server in Ireland with one no</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1498.48" data-end="1500.43">J's process we did that for two years</span> <span data-start="1500.43" data-end="1503.7">and it worked fine but we figured like</span> <span data-start="1503.7" data-end="1507.4">some put scaling is going to be an issue</span> <span data-start="1507.41" data-end="1509.55">so we started working on improving that</span> <span data-start="1509.55" data-end="1511.26">of course but at the same time we saw</span> <span data-start="1511.26" data-end="1513.27">that there were two rooms with very</span> <span data-start="1513.27" data-end="1515.88">easily guessable room names that were</span> <span data-start="1515.88" data-end="1518.22">extremely active that every day of the</span> <span data-start="1518.22" data-end="1520.23">eye of the hour every hour of the day</span> <span data-start="1520.23" data-end="1522.81">and people were in there filling up the</span> <span data-start="1522.81" data-end="1524.85">with eight people I didn't think much</span> <span data-start="1524.85" data-end="1526.56">about it but one of the rooms were</span> <span data-start="1526.56" data-end="1528">actually owned by one of the team so we</span> <span data-start="1528" data-end="1529.5">went in there to check out what was</span> <span data-start="1529.5" data-end="1532.2">going on what we found was people just</span> <span data-start="1532.2" data-end="1533.55">chatting together getting to know each</span> <span data-start="1533.55" data-end="1537.15">other nothing serious but one one person</span> <span data-start="1537.15" data-end="1541.68">left another person joined this was sort</span> <span data-start="1541.68" data-end="1543.9">of sort of fine we thought we didn't</span> <span data-start="1543.9" data-end="1548.7">think much more of it but the</span> <span data-start="1548.7" data-end="1550.17">performance of the server got worse and</span> <span data-start="1550.17" data-end="1551.85">worse when we started shutting off more</span> <span data-start="1551.85" data-end="1553.59">and more features to try and actually</span> <span data-start="1553.59" data-end="1554.94">get it up and running how the core</span> <span data-start="1554.94" data-end="1558.15">service at least work and once we killed</span> <span data-start="1558.15" data-end="1559.95">notifications everything suddenly</span> <span data-start="1559.95" data-end="1561.72">improved so we sort of had like a hint</span> <span data-start="1561.72" data-end="1563.25">that where the problem was we started</span> <span data-start="1563.25" data-end="1568.05">investigating so it turns out that the</span> <span data-start="1568.05" data-end="1570.54">feature that we built had some duty</span> <span data-start="1570.54" data-end="1573.75">mostly technical debt and other yeah</span> <span data-start="1573.75" data-end="1575.61">reasons that come from having a product</span> <span data-start="1575.61" data-end="1578.22">running for two years some weird code</span> <span data-start="1578.22" data-end="1580.09">bats</span> <span data-start="1580.09" data-end="1582.37">and we had to sign this feature to be</span> <span data-start="1582.37" data-end="1585.34">mostly for six to seven people and we</span> <span data-start="1585.34" data-end="1586.83">haven't given much thought to</span> <span data-start="1586.83" data-end="1590.559">performance like at all it didn't really</span> <span

data-end="1596.5">that but it turns out that for every</span> <span data-start="1596.5" data-end="1599.89">follower we were fetching the user data</span> <span data-start="1599.89"

data-end="1608.65">load base we're a map over each follower</span> <span data-start="1608.65" data-end="1610.21">and then we have something called the</span> <span data-start="1610.21" data-end="1612.34">user in richer which unless you were</span> <span data-start="1612.34" data-end="1613.69">familiar with the code and the pearson</span> <span data-start="1613.69" data-end="1615.61">implementing this worse not it actually</span> <span data-start="1615.61" data-end="1617.98">made a database query and this was fine</span> <span data-start="1617.98" data-end="1620.679">for ten maybe fifteen people but when we</span> <span data-start="1620.679" data-end="1623.77">had 500 plus people following a room for</span> <span data-start="1623.77" data-end="1626.049">every chat message you would do 500 and</span> <span data-start="1626.049" data-end="1628.12">then for some weird reason we were</span> <span data-start="1628.12" data-end="1629.919">throwing away the data which we got here</span> <span data-start="1629.919" data-end="1631.6">and then doing the same query three or</span> <span data-start="1631.6" data-end="1634.99">four more times which ended up resulting</span> <span data-start="1634.99" data-end="1637.51">we had two thousand database reads and a</span> <span data-start="1637.51" data-end="1639.64">thousand database rights / chat message</span> <span data-start="1639.64" data-end="1641.14">sent in those rooms directed all the</span> <span data-start="1641.14" data-end="1646.659">time which is crazy yeah so actually the</span> <span data-start="1646.659" data-end="1648.94">database was backed up that calls long</span> <span data-start="1648.94" data-end="1651.13">event cuse a node and triggered garbage</span> <span data-start="1651.13" data-end="1653.649">collection everything went to yeah</span> <span data-start="1653.649" data-end="1657.07">everything went amok really sonai should</span> <span data-start="1657.07" data-end="1658.539">be fixed it by having smarter queries</span> <span data-start="1658.539" data-end="1660.399">and we do both developers do we sort of</span> <span data-start="1660.399" data-end="1662.77">fix our problems but it's a nice example</span> <span data-start="1662.77" data-end="1665.799">of how the feature that you taught you</span> <span data-start="1665.799" data-end="1667.39">you knew exactly how it's going to be</span> <span data-start="1667.39" data-end="1668.86">used was used in a totally different way</span> <span data-start="1668.86" data-end="1670.63">than you expected with you and the code</span> <span data-start="1670.63" data-end="1672.429">that you write was actually negatively</span> <span data-start="1672.429" data-end="1674.32">impacting the performance of the servers</span> <span data-start="1674.32" data-end="1679.02">because of it and this happened because</span> <span data-start="1679.02" data-end="1681.1">when teens couldn't talk to their</span> <span data-start="1681.1" data-end="1682.69">friends when they weren't there they</span> <span data-start="1682.69" data-end="1684.13">were seeking other people to talk to you</span> <span data-start="1684.13" data-end="1685.6">and when they found these rooms with a</span> <span data-start="1685.6" data-end="1687.49">lot of users naturally they wanted to</span> <span data-start="1687.49" data-end="1689.169">follow those rooms that I could have</span> <span data-start="1689.169" data-end="1690.25">people to talk to you and it wasn't</span> <span data-start="1690.25" data-end="1692.26">generally like a good atmosphere in</span> <span data-start="1692.26" data-end="1693.58">these rooms as well there wasn't</span> <span data-start="1693.58" data-end="1695.11">anything like dangerous going on or</span> <span data-start="1695.11" data-end="1700.63">awkward going on really anyway I was a</span> <span data-start="1700.63" data-end="1703.779">bit of a regression but I hope to have</span> <span data-start="1703.779" data-end="1705.64">showed you that sort of to my own</span> <span data-start="1705.64" data-end="1708.1">experience that user experience is about</span> <span data-start="1708.1" data-end="1710.32">a lot more than just green and red</span> <span data-start="1710.32" data-end="1712.78">buttons it's about how you go about</span> <span data-start="1712.78" data-end="1713.83">understanding</span> <span data-start="1713.83" data-end="1716.08">how you talk to users how you find</span> <span data-start="1716.08" data-end="1718.48">minimal solutions to implement something</span> <span data-start="1718.48" data-end="1721.84">as fast as you can to test it out but</span> <span data-start="1721.84" data-end="1723.85">how you implement them it's about the</span> <span data-start="1723.85" data-end="1726.64">presentation and the messages you send</span> <span data-start="1726.64" data-end="1729.909">to users in the end and finally how you</span> <span data-start="1729.909" data-end="1731.679">refined that solution based on the</span> <span data-start="1731.679" data-end="1735.1">feedback and really it is about how you</span> <span data-start="1735.1" data-end="1737.11">write code how you approach problems and</span> <span data-start="1737.11" data-end="1738.61">how we communicate with your team and</span> <span data-start="1738.61" data-end="1741.309">your users so I really think that user</span> <span
