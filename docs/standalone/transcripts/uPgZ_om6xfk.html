looks a bit</span> <span data-start="84.12" data-end="86.85">word i know but when i was a kid like</span> <span data-start="86.85" data-end="89.64">six or seven years old i always imagined</span> <span data-start="89.64" data-end="92.52">it later when i'm working in my working</span> <span data-start="92.52" data-end="95.57">life that i will be in some lab and</span> <span data-start="95.57" data-end="98.13">actually looking like this every day and</span> <span data-start="98.13" data-end="100.56">doing some weird stuff building cool</span> <span data-start="100.56" data-end="105.33">things yeah but then I discovered our</span> <span data-start="105.33" data-end="108.29">script and after a while I thought yeah</span> <span data-start="108.29" data-end="111.3">actually I'm doing exactly that what I</span> <span data-start="111.3" data-end="114.02">dreamt of when I was kid so like</span> <span data-start="114.02" data-end="117.93">building all these crazy things here and</span> <span data-start="117.93" data-end="121.95">yeah so let's start the actual talk I</span> <span data-start="121.95" data-end="126.54">brought three kind of examples things I</span> <span data-start="126.54" data-end="129.989">build at home um I just figure out the</span> <span data-start="129.989" data-end="133.62">first one won't work because of some</span> <span data-start="133.62" data-end="135.51">network issues but I still tell you a</span> <span data-start="135.51" data-end="139.41">bit about it so actually um about</span> <span data-start="139.41" data-end="144.79">something called the trial detector so</span> <span data-start="144.8" data-end="147.81">the actual quest was that I'm spotting</span> <span data-start="147.81" data-end="149.19">the trolls here in the room</span> <span data-start="149.19" data-end="154.12">that tweet bath stuff during the talk</span> <span data-start="154.13" data-end="157.41">but yeah let's come to that later but</span> <span data-start="157.41" data-end="159.39">you're due to some network issues that</span> <span data-start="159.39" data-end="161.67">won't work because the actual setup boss</span> <span data-start="161.67" data-end="164.96">you see this this lamp here maybe and</span> <span data-start="164.96" data-end="171.42">this is attached to wireless power</span> <span data-start="171.42" data-end="179">plaque you can buy on Amazon and this</span> <span data-start="179" data-end="183">book's if I turn it on here no yeah so</span> <span data-start="183" data-end="189.21">you can see ok works manually and I'm</span> <span data-start="189.21" data-end="192.42">actually this works through the zigbee</span> <span data-start="192.42" data-end="194.19">wireless protocol is some kind of</span> <span data-start="194.19" data-end="196.56">standard protocol and I rode a node</span> <span data-start="196.56" data-end="199.77">library that you can that abstracts this</span> <span data-start="199.77" data-end="202.05">protocol this is not like it because</span> <span data-start="202.05" data-end="205.41">it's pretty unstable and well so you see</span> <span data-start="205.41" data-end="207.75">it's not working yet so it's really</span> <span data-start="207.75" data-end="210.6">unstable and I will work a bit on it and</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="213.6">then I will release it but yeah ZigBee</span> <span data-start="213.6" data-end="215.94">protocol is like a wireless</span> <span data-start="215.94" data-end="218.57">communication protocol and it's</span> <span data-start="218.57" data-end="221.16">standardized and open protocol so</span> <span data-start="221.16" data-end="223.23">everybody can just like grabbed it and</span> <span data-start="223.23" data-end="226.44">builds devil it works like bluetooth</span> <span data-start="226.44" data-end="230.7">kind of 16 communication channels can</span> <span data-start="230.7" data-end="234.06">fool duplex and you can do a scene</span> <span data-start="234.06" data-end="236.07">communication also there are you know</span> <span data-start="236.07" data-end="237.54">connectors i'm currently working with</span> <span data-start="237.54" data-end="241.739">the XP shields but this is kind of hard</span> <span data-start="241.739" data-end="245.07">to get around yeah there are also like</span> <span data-start="245.07" data-end="247.92">devices are standardized so you can buy</span> <span data-start="247.92" data-end="250.68">like this wireless power plaques on</span> <span data-start="250.68" data-end="254.22">amazon for like 20 euros or something</span> <span data-start="254.22" data-end="257.64">and then use them with any environment</span> <span data-start="257.64" data-end="259.26">you want that speaks the ZigBee protocol</span> <span data-start="259.26" data-end="263.61">and by the way when I'm when I did this</span> <span data-start="263.61" data-end="266.13">like kind of library abstraction I just</span> <span data-start="266.13" data-end="268.56">find thought that the guys who went to</span> <span data-start="268.56" data-end="269.61">the protocol must be on crack or</span> <span data-start="269.61" data-end="271.95">something because this is so weird</span> <span data-start="271.95" data-end="275.13">standing like packages with hex values</span> <span data-start="275.13" data-end="280.26">around and not good at math and just</span> <span data-start="280.26" data-end="281.91">really sucks when</span> <span data-start="281.91" data-end="284.82">you're not good at math so but I built</span> <span data-start="284.82" data-end="285.99">this library that will be released</span> <span data-start="285.99" data-end="291.12">somewhere in the future yeah that I</span> <span data-start="291.12" data-end="293.97">think it has some easy API so you can</span> <span data-start="293.97" data-end="296.52">just like discover the wireless</span> <span data-start="296.52" data-end="298.2">controller that you will connect with</span> <span data-start="298.2" data-end="301.53">your devices that you have you can start</span> <span data-start="301.53" data-end="305.18">a device discovery and actually like</span> <span data-start="305.18" data-end="310.02">getting to know these both so let's ddu</span> <span data-start="310.02" data-end="311.49">the wireless control speak with the</span> <span data-start="311.49" data-end="316.2">device and yeah so the device is called</span> <span data-start="316.2" data-end="319.35">will return all available devices these</span> <span data-start="319.35" data-end="321.96">have some common types like this one</span> <span data-start="321.96" data-end="326.28">will say hi I'm a binary switch and the</span> <span data-start="326.28" data-end="329.16">other one will and also it will say like</span> <span data-start="329.16" data-end="331.17">a are the status currently I'm turned on</span> <span data-start="331.17" data-end="334.86">and then you will have some easy actions</span> <span data-start="334.86" data-end="337.53">like turning things on and off hood when</span> <span data-start="337.53" data-end="340.62">it works then it works with these binary</span> <span data-start="340.62" data-end="343.29">switch things only but I will implement</span> <span data-start="343.29" data-end="345.57">some more drivers soon when I release a</span> <span data-start="345.57" data-end="348.69">library okay yeah sad that i discovered</span> <span data-start="348.69" data-end="350.61">that that won't work because there would</span> <span data-start="350.61" data-end="355.47">be a cool thing to show but let's move</span> <span data-start="355.47" data-end="362.05">on to another thing abroad here actually</span> <span data-start="362.06" data-end="369.38">uh-huh i have a connect here these</span> <span data-start="369.38" data-end="373.32">things i just type here is not like</span> <span data-start="373.32" data-end="375.21">comin fer to connect because when i</span> <span data-start="375.21" data-end="378.419">arrived in berlin on friday i just like</span> <span data-start="378.419" data-end="380.19">set up everything in my hotel room to</span> <span data-start="380.19" data-end="384.21">test if it works and to connect connect</span> <span data-start="384.21" data-end="387.03">gotta serio got a serious damage during</span> <span data-start="387.03" data-end="391.11">the fight and so a friday morning free i</span> <span data-start="391.11" data-end="394.32">am I like saturday morning for um I just</span> <span data-start="394.32" data-end="397.14">my last chance was to open it and I only</span> <span data-start="397.14" data-end="399.36">had a Swiss Army knife carrying with me</span> <span data-start="399.36" data-end="403.5">so I will never ever do that do that</span> <span data-start="403.5" data-end="405.66">again not in a hotel room not at three</span> <span data-start="405.66" data-end="408">o'clock in the morning opening a connect</span> <span data-start="408" data-end="414.51">but it kind of worked after this surgery</span> <span data-start="414.51" data-end="419.4">and so hopefully this will work so the</span> <span data-start="419.4" data-end="424.79">quest is make you're a proud of me and</span> <span data-start="424.79" data-end="429.51">actually what I'm trying to do is let</span> <span data-start="429.51" data-end="432.8">the kinect recognize a gesture i'm doing</span> <span data-start="432.8" data-end="437.79">then brought the kinect will give all</span> <span data-start="437.79" data-end="440.34">that stream to this Windows PC which has</span> <span data-start="440.34" data-end="441.99">to connect SDK installed and there's</span> <span data-start="441.99" data-end="443.88">some library running which will then</span> <span data-start="443.88" data-end="447.99">broadcast some broadcast some WebSocket</span> <span data-start="447.99" data-end="450.48">event which I'm catching in a browser</span> <span data-start="450.48" data-end="453.39">here on this computer and this computer</span> <span data-start="453.39" data-end="457.08">actually then we'll go and say hey</span> <span data-start="457.08" data-end="462.09">arduino please just let these tin cans</span> <span data-start="462.09" data-end="465.9">flip over okay and let's see if that one</span> <span data-start="465.9" data-end="479.67">we work huh it's running okay so after</span> <span data-start="479.67" data-end="483.74">this connector Udrih it worked like in</span> <span data-start="483.74" data-end="488.88">sixty percent of the things that drive</span> <span data-start="488.88" data-end="497.31">so hopefully so the bad way the infrared</span> <span data-start="497.31" data-end="507">sensor is gone so let's see how come on</span> <span data-start="507" data-end="522.43">come on come on</span> <span data-start="522.44" data-end="526.079">okay maybe will someone come over and</span> <span data-start="526.079" data-end="529.649">try his jedi force on the second one any</span> <span data-start="529.649" data-end="537.899">volunteer no I just come over just like</span> <span data-start="537.899" data-end="540.36">try to position some around here because</span> <span data-start="540.36" data-end="542.79">the kinect has some damage you won't see</span> <span data-start="542.79" data-end="544.68">yourself here normally you would see</span> <span data-start="544.68" data-end="548.22">yourself here and it's kind of hard</span> <span data-start="548.22" data-end="552.149">because no you don't know what to do but</span> <span data-start="552.149" data-end="559.62">still stand here and try um just give</span> <span data-start="559.62" data-end="561.6">just stay here for like two or three</span> <span data-start="561.6" data-end="567.36">seconds and I hope they're just do it a</span> <span data-start="567.36" data-end="590.17">couple of times just thank you</span> <span data-start="590.18" data-end="594.5">yeah I actually I just like did</span> <span data-start="594.5" data-end="596.66">something that was way cooler than this</span> <span data-start="596.66" data-end="601.01">like a shooting game so hopefully that</span> <span data-start="601.01" data-end="606.26">if the internet works uh-huh I did</span> <span data-start="606.26" data-end="610.25">something enter user group like a couple</span> <span data-start="610.25" data-end="614.12">of months ago and you see actually you</span> <span data-start="614.12" data-end="617.12">can really control this little rat</span> <span data-start="617.12" data-end="621.399">cursor inside of your browser window and</span> <span data-start="621.399" data-end="624.95">this is way more cool than what I showed</span> <span data-start="624.95" data-end="627.47">here and actually had this cool example</span> <span data-start="627.47" data-end="629.959">we're just like point on things and take</span> <span data-start="629.959" data-end="632.33">your other hand and shoot and shoot and</span> <span data-start="632.33" data-end="635.36">when you hit the virtual tin can I would</span> <span data-start="635.36" data-end="638.36">just flip this one over but damage</span> <span data-start="638.36" data-end="642.41">connect and a failure but hope you</span> <span data-start="642.41" data-end="647.209">enjoyed it what the other one too okay</span> <span data-start="647.209" data-end="654.62">so let's see how that works ok meet</span> <span data-start="654.62" data-end="657.709">connect Jess connect us is a library</span> <span data-start="657.709" data-end="660.29">that some I think some guys from Norway</span> <span data-start="660.29" data-end="664.459">build like half a year ago and this</span> <span data-start="664.459" data-end="667.67">one's super cool as a it uses the kinect</span> <span data-start="667.67" data-end="670.52">sdk so this is why I have this windows</span> <span data-start="670.52" data-end="675.17">laptop here and it's a little program</span> <span data-start="675.17" data-end="679.279">that runs on on this computer which</span> <span data-start="679.279" data-end="682.1">dispatches like you ends why sockets and</span> <span data-start="682.1" data-end="685.1">broadcast em to the network also they've</span> <span data-start="685.1" data-end="687.77">built some neat client-side JavaScript</span> <span data-start="687.77" data-end="690.17">library and it which introduces new</span> <span data-start="690.17" data-end="693.62">events so you can do like at evangelist</span> <span data-start="693.62" data-end="695.75">interconnect touch start to a need um</span> <span data-start="695.75" data-end="698.45">alum and and then react on that this is</span> <span data-start="698.45" data-end="702.19">so cool and you can set this up in like</span> <span data-start="702.19" data-end="704.839">15 to 20 minutes to do something in your</span> <span data-start="704.839" data-end="707.36">browser it can handle two players</span> <span data-start="707.36" data-end="710.3">actually so they also have a nice demo</span> <span data-start="710.3" data-end="712.279">with a pong game to place the two</span> <span data-start="712.279" data-end="715">players playing against each other and</span> <span data-start="715" data-end="718.04">it also has some predefined gestures one</span> <span data-start="718.04" data-end="720.89">we saw there to swipe gesture and they</span> <span data-start="720.89" data-end="722.63">also have something like a jump Chester</span> <span data-start="722.63" data-end="723.26">when you jump</span> <span data-start="723.26" data-end="726.53">up and down and this is pretty pretty</span> <span data-start="726.53" data-end="733.22">cool okay for my next project that I</span> <span data-start="733.22" data-end="739.01">call the Dancy Dancy I need another</span> <span data-start="739.01" data-end="743.06">volunteer out of the audience somebody</span> <span data-start="743.06" data-end="747.35">is willing to dance in front of okay</span> <span data-start="747.35" data-end="750.89">maybe maybe you will you would trust me</span> <span data-start="750.89" data-end="754.15">that nothing bad will happen as I just</span> <span data-start="754.15" data-end="756.92">ruined my street credibility on my own</span> <span data-start="756.92" data-end="760.58">and dance barefoot in the front of all</span> <span data-start="760.58" data-end="768.86">of you so let's try that yeah looks</span> <span data-start="768.86" data-end="773.42">beautiful or and I should turn on the</span> <span data-start="773.42" data-end="792.24">audio okay that sounds good so mm-hmm</span> <span data-start="792.25" data-end="795.38">looks like it's wicker so okay I really</span> <span data-start="795.38" data-end="799.64">never thought i would do this but I'm</span> <span data-start="799.64" data-end="801.83">doing it oh by the way this hook stuff I</span> <span data-start="801.83" data-end="805.28">read them right now yeah i did because</span> <span data-start="805.28"
