testing</span> <span data-start="260.26" data-end="262.78">the application and it's basically like</span> <span data-start="262.78" data-end="265.33">it's a fork of the wine cellar backbone</span>

data-end="286.75">don't I do like just type something in</span> <span data-start="286.75" data-end="288.58">for fun and see see what happens I'll</span> <span data-start="288.58" data-end="293.31">turn my interceptor on and I'll save and</span> <span data-start="293.31" data-end="295.54">my request comes through and it looks</span> <span data-start="295.54"

data-end="303.19">this is the expected behavior now let's</span> <span data-start="303.19" data-end="306.3">try to do something malicious and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="306.3" data-end="308.59">JavaScript starts with a script i</span> <span data-start="308.59" data-end="312.19">believe and we'll put a pop-up notifying</span> <span data-start="312.19" data-end="317.84">our users that they have been hacked</span> <span data-start="317.85" data-end="322.24">i'll hit save okay nothing looks like it</span> <span data-start="322.24" data-end="325.86">really happened not super exciting oh</span> <span data-start="325.86" data-end="331.21">look our pop-up just fired so this this</span> <span data-start="331.21" data-end="333.49">is a clearly vulnerable to cross-site</span> <span data-start="333.49" data-end="335.68">scripting now we've injected a malicious</span> <span data-start="335.68" data-end="339.669">about malicious URL into or script into</span> <span data-start="339.669" data-end="341.919">our page moreover every time we load</span> <span data-start="341.919" data-end="345.43">this page again it's going to come back</span> <span data-start="345.43" data-end="349.09">again this is a stored cross-site</span> <span data-start="349.09" data-end="355.82">scripting attack and so I'm sitting here</span> <span data-start="355.83" data-end="358.09">and I'm really excited now because I'm</span> <span data-start="358.09" data-end="360.729">able to go to my client and tell them oh</span> <span data-start="360.729" data-end="363.28">my gosh like we found stored cross-site</span> <span data-start="363.28" data-end="364.93">scripting on your application this is a</span> <span data-start="364.93" data-end="367.3">really serious deal this is I mean this</span> <span data-start="367.3" data-end="369.13">is like their bug bounty programs that</span> <span data-start="369.13" data-end="371.14">pay upwards of ten thousand dollars for</span> <span data-start="371.14" data-end="372.669">finding you know flaws like this on</span> <span data-start="372.669" data-end="375.43">their application so I am extremely</span> <span data-start="375.43" data-end="377.229">excited and I tell my client this and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="377.229" data-end="378.88">I'm expecting them to be you know</span> <span data-start="378.88" data-end="380.83">writing me a million-dollar check and</span> <span

impressed and</span> <span data-start="392.069" data-end="394.949">I'm wondering why is it that you know</span> <span data-start="394.949" data-end="396.9">you might not be impressed by this</span> <span data-start="396.9" data-end="398.819">vulnerability I mean this is a really</span> <span data-start="398.819" data-end="400.469">critical vulnerability and I was able to</span> <span data-start="400.469" data-end="403.529">easily demonstrate it so I'm like no</span> <span data-start="403.529" data-end="404.639">this is actually a really serious</span> <span data-start="404.639" data-end="406.08">problem you should you should take a</span> <span data-start="406.08" data-end="409.379">look at it and they they're like no and</span> <span data-start="409.379" data-end="411.449">there's two reasons why they don't care</span> <span data-start="411.449" data-end="415.02">about it the first reason is that fur</span> <span data-start="415.02" data-end="418.469">starters the the request that I've</span> <span data-start="418.469" data-end="421.65">demonstrated happens in a you know in a</span> <span data-start="421.65" data-end="424.499">put request and so there's a vulnerable</span> <span data-start="424.499" data-end="427.439">parameter in the put request and the</span> <span data-start="427.439" data-end="430.43">only way for me to actually attack the</span> <span data-start="430.43" data-end="433.02">application is if I were was able to</span> <span data-start="433.02" data-end="435.389">intercept the put request and inject my</span> <span data-start="435.389" data-end="436.71">malicious content and send it to the</span> <span data-start="436.71" data-end="439.77">server right now this process is really</span> <span data-start="439.77" data-end="441.12">difficult to do unless you're just</span> <span data-start="441.12" data-end="443.37">attacking yourself this is the clients</span> <span data-start="443.37" data-end="444.899">logic as well I mean there's there's no</span> <span data-start="444.899" data-end="448.379">way that a user who we trust to use our</span> <span data-start="448.379" data-end="450.749">server would would do this to themselves</span> <span data-start="450.749" data-end="452.61">so I don't really think that this is a</span> <span data-start="452.61" data-end="454.74">big deal I don't really see any huge</span> <span data-start="454.74" data-end="456.629">need to fix from this so unless you can</span> <span data-start="456.629" data-end="457.949">show us something else I think you</span> <span data-start="457.949" data-end="461.039">should just try harder secondly the</span> <span data-start="461.039" data-end="462.749">application is not even exposed to the</span> <span data-start="462.749" data-end="465.3">public internet it's a private server so</span> <span data-start="465.3" data-end="468.089">you know I can't even go to their</span> <span data-start="468.089" data-end="469.77">application and test it i have to go</span> <span data-start="469.77" data-end="471.539">through some kind of VPN that only they</span> <span data-start="471.539" data-end="477.419">have access to so i'm a little dejected</span> <span data-start="477.419" data-end="479.159">by this because i put a lot of effort</span> <span data-start="479.159" data-end="482.009">into this vulnerability and it didn't</span> <span data-start="482.009" data-end="484.229">really make much of an impact and in</span> <span data-start="484.229" data-end="485.999">fact they're they're thinking about</span> <span data-start="485.999" data-end="488.31">letting this vulnerability just go and</span> <span data-start="488.31" data-end="489.93">slide without really demonstrating any</span> <span data-start="489.93" data-end="493.499">real impact from it and so I feel a</span> <span data-start="493.499" data-end="497.55">little dejected off by that but I sit</span> <span data-start="497.55" data-end="499.439">back and I ask myself two very important</span> <span data-start="499.439" data-end="502.469">questions one how do we exploit</span> <span data-start="502.469" data-end="504.87">vulnerabilities that require victims to</span> <span data-start="504.87" data-end="507.599">attack themselves so to speak secondly</span> <span data-start="507.599" data-end="509.31">how do we attack web applications on a</span> <span data-start="509.31" data-end="510.99">private network like that we can't even</span> <span data-start="510.99" data-end="514.169">access I mean is application security</span> <span data-start="514.169" data-end="515.08">limited to just</span> <span data-start="515.08" data-end="517.84">public things so after doing a little</span> <span data-start="517.84" data-end="520.26">bit of googling and research and study I</span> <span data-start="520.26" data-end="523.69">came across this class of a text called</span> <span data-start="523.69" data-end="527.02">to surf attacks on Caesar for tax are</span> <span data-start="527.02" data-end="529.99">kind of the vulnerability that many</span> <span data-start="529.99" data-end="532.15">people might not have heard about but</span> <span data-start="532.15" data-end="534.19">can actually be used in very crucial</span> <span data-start="534.19" data-end="536.14">situations to really deliver some very</span> <span data-start="536.14" data-end="541.6">cool cool results so Caesar stands for</span> <span data-start="541.6" data-end="544.78">cross-site request forgery so what this</span> <span data-start="544.78" data-end="546.16">basically means is if we look at how</span> <span data-start="546.16" data-end="548.02">this works is if we have you know our</span> <span data-start="548.02"

because both people have access to</span> <span data-start="573.91" data-end="576.25">the public Internet when Bob goes to</span> <span data-start="576.25" data-end="578.83">this domain and interacts

works okay well I have here on a</span> <span data-start="633.55" data-end="644.91">public server a</span> <span data-start="644.92" data-end="648.8">there we go so here is a public page you</span>

data-end="662.81">associated with our med seller</span> <span data-start="662.81" data-end="669.82">application but it is very convincing I</span> <span data-start="669.82" data-end="673.6">would like to get 1 million dollars and</span> <span data-start="673.6" data-end="675.949">it's on the internet so it can't be a</span> <span data-start="675.949" data-end="680.149">lie so so I'll turn my interceptor on</span> <span data-start="680.149" data-end="681.41">cuz I'm a little cautious I want to see</span> <span data-start="681.41" data-end="682.73">what's actually happening behind the</span> <span data-start="682.73" data-end="688.19">scenes I'll submit this request if you</span> <span data-start="688.19" data-end="689.75">take a look here what's happening is</span> <span data-start="689.75" data-end="691.91">we're sending a post request to register</span> <span data-start="691.91" data-end="695.98">an admin user by the name of lolcatz</span> <span data-start="695.98" data-end="700.579">until let's just see if this works and</span> <span data-start="700.579" data-end="702.68">we're actually redirected to the Maine</span> <span data-start="702.68" data-end="706.069">med seller page so let's try logging in</span> <span data-start="706.069" data-end="714.8">with our new user LOLOL and of course</span> <span data-start="714.8" data-end="717.38">we're hacked but now as you can see we</span> <span data-start="717.38" data-end="719.449">are we're logged in as an administrative</span> <span data-start="719.449" data-end="723.35">user because we've exploited the Caesar</span> <span data-start="723.35" data-end="726.11">phoner ability on this application now</span> <span data-start="726.11" data-end="728.6">one thing to note is that the way that</span> <span data-start="728.6" data-end="730.06">this application works is that there are</span> <span data-start="730.06" data-end="732.56">admin users and normal roles and so</span> <span data-start="732.56" data-end="734.389">we've actually created an admin account</span> <span data-start="734.389" data-end="736.04">which is why we're able to see all of</span> <span data-start="736.04" data-end="738.74">the medicines even the prescription</span> <span data-start="738.74" data-end="741.579">medicines in this case and so this is a</span> <span data-start="741.579" data-end="744.829">you know we've just kind of exploited</span> <span data-start="744.829" data-end="748.699">this vulnerability using a boner ability</span> <span data-start="748.699" data-end="754.22">that we didn't think was possible before</span> <span data-start="754.22" data-end="756.8">and so we're really happy and we go back</span> <span data-start="756.8" data-end="758.779">to the clients and we tell them you know</span> <span data-start="758.779" data-end="760.73">we've used to surf and now we are able</span> <span data-start="760.73" data-end="763.43">to attack your application even if</span> <span data-start="763.43" data-end="765.949">you're not publicly accessible so we're</span> <span data-start="765.949" data-end="769.459">making progress they come back to us and</span> <span data-start="769.459" data-end="771.699">they say you know that's cool but we use</span> <span data-start="771.699" data-end="773.169">web services and everything is handled</span> <span data-start="773.169" data-end="775.629">by a JSON request and so the whole logic</span> <span data-start="775.629" data-end="777.22">behind your attack is that you're</span> <span data-start="777.22" data-end="780.129">forging an HTML reform to be submitted</span> <span data-start="780.129" data-end="783.85">to my server and because we can't forge</span> <span data-start="783.85" data-end="786.79">an HTML form to send json requests this</span> <span data-start="786.79" data-end="789.66">is really not an issue for us either so</span> <span data-start="789.66" data-end="796.66">try harder and so it's a little bit of a</span> <span data-start="796.66" data-end="798.459">setback now because even though we found</span> <span data-start="798.459" data-end="800.529">we've made progress we're still not able</span> <span data-start="800.529" data-end="803.889">to you know completely convince them</span> <span data-start="803.889" data-end="805.869">that we can chain exploits together and</span> <span data-start="805.869" data-end="811.419">make danger happen but then we start</span> <span data-start="811.419" data-end="813.129">thinking about things and the way that</span> <span data-start="813.129" data-end="815.139">the JavaScript works and JavaScript</span> <span data-start="815.139" data-end="819.609">servers handle requests and we realize</span> <span data-start="819.609" data-end="822.069">that you know JSON posts are not</span> <span data-start="822.069" data-end="824.339">completely safe if you think about how</span> <span data-start="824.339" data-end="828.1">you know the server handles request</span> <span data-start="828.1" data-end="829.929">server-side you'llyou'll most of you</span> <span data-start="829.929" data-end="831.22">have probably written if you've written</span> <span data-start="831.22" data-end="832.449">server-side code you've probably written</span> <span data-start="832.449" data-end="834.579">a function similar to this we have fun</span> <span data-start="834.579" data-end="835.929">can request response and then you're</span> <span data-start="835.929" data-end="837.939">setting some body parameter from your</span> <span data-start="837.939" data-end="842.709">post under request body and request body</span> <span data-start="842.709" data-end="846.879">is actually a JSON so what what's</span> <span data-start="846.879" data-end="851.399">interesting here is that well you know</span> <span data-start="851.399" data-end="853.959">even though the application is expecting</span> <span data-start="853.959" data-end="855.279">something that looks like this which</span> <span data-start="855.279" data-end="857.739">with encoding type JSON if you don't</span> <span data-start="857.739" data-end="862.419">specifically say that I'm only going to</span> <span data-start="862.419" data-end="864.459">accept JSON objects and I'm not going to</span> <span data-start="864.459" data-end="866.709">accept anything else if you send a</span> <span data-start="866.709" data-end="868.539">request that looks like this of text</span> <span data-start="868.539" data-end="873.309">type plane it'll still come as a request</span> <span data-start="873.309" data-end="875.259">object and you know and the server side</span> <span data-start="875.259" data-end="877.239">it handles it as a JSON so we can</span> <span data-start="877.239" data-end="882.85">theoretically you know use use our</span> <span data-start="882.85" data-end="885.339">exploit to you know forge an HTML</span> <span data-start="885.339" data-end="887.47">request as though we're in HTML form and</span> <span data-start="887.47" data-end="892.569">and exploit the server but this time</span> <span data-start="892.569" data-end="893.769">let's have some fun because we've</span> <span data-start="893.769" data-end="894.759">already discovered that there's a</span> <span data-start="894.759" data-end="896.259">cross-site scripting vulnerability and</span> <span data-start="896.259" data-end="897.999">that's really what we're after how to</span> <span

before is really</span> <span data-start="910.619" data-end="912.389">really cool it basically makes</span> <span data-start="912.389" data-end="914.399">exploiting cross-site scripting almost</span> <span data-start="914.399" data-end="916.799">like a point-and-click kind of thing and</span> <span data-start="916.799" data-end="921.629">so we're going to use this now and we</span> <span data-start="921.629" data-end="935.73">have here very conveniently we have</span> <span data-start="935.74" data-end="938.82">okay so this is another seesaw request</span> <span data-start="938.82" data-end="945.55">and this is a even more convincing</span> <span data-start="945.55" data-end="947.77">argument in the last because we didn't</span> <span data-start="947.77" data-end="949.72">win anything last time but telling us</span> <span data-start="949.72" data-end="953.26">this time we will actually win let's</span> <span data-start="953.26" data-end="954.79">take a look at what this is actually</span> <span data-start="954.79" data-end="958.12">doing flips view the page source and if</span> <span data-start="958.12" data-end="959.89">you can see over here we have you know</span>

data-end="1013.02">guy here and this is a this is we've</span> <span data-start="1013.02" data-end="1016.83">just created a new medicine and we see</span> <span data-start="1016.83"

that our IP address</span> <span data-start="1075.47" data-end="1077.419">is online and we actually have remote</span> <span data-start="1077.419" data-end="1079.88">access our to our browser and we

data-start="1088.01" data-end="1089.269">that we have some commands that we can</span> <span data-start="1089.269" data-end="1100.159">kick off and let's see so there are some</span> <span data-start="1100.159" data-end="1102.38">very interesting exploits here you can</span> <span data-start="1102.38" data-end="1104.179">find the session cookie for the users</span> <span

data-start="1115.85" data-end="1118.88">a sound so I can try to stream my</span> <span data-start="1118.88" data-end="1122.57">content through another person's browser</span> <span

data-start="1146.6" data-end="1148.25">we're now doing this all remote as well</span> <span data-start="1148.25" data-end="1150.62">so we're able to kick off our own audio</span> <span
