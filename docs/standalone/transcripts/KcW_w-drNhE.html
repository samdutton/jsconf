data-start="232.29" data-end="235.2">let's start with some science that</span> <span data-start="235.2" data-end="237.579">typography probably never killed anyone</span> <span data-start="237.579" data-end="239.5">um I put probably in just in case</span> <span data-start="239.5" data-end="240.7">there's any like lawyers or</span> <span data-start="240.7" data-end="242.079">fact-checking people in the world maybe</span> <span data-start="242.079" data-end="243.85">it has happened but chances are it</span> <span data-start="243.85" data-end="244.93">hasn't happened very</span> <span data-start="244.93" data-end="250.18">um so you know there's also been the</span> <span data-start="250.18" data-end="251.439">worst thing that could probably happen</span> <span data-start="251.439" data-end="253.239">with bad typography is you can look a</span> <span data-start="253.239" data-end="254.5">little bad maybe you can look a little</span> <span data-start="254.5" data-end="256.209">bit like out of style a little bit</span> <span data-start="256.209" data-end="258.43">awkward a little bit ugly but it's not</span> <span data-start="258.43" data-end="260.829">really gonna hurt anything you know</span> <span data-start="260.829" data-end="261.82">worst thing you might look a little</span> <span data-start="261.82" data-end="263.229">below average but they're not gonna be</span> <span data-start="263.229" data-end="265.81">like painfully hurting anyone there's</span> <span data-start="265.81" data-end="267.55">been some scientific studies even just</span> <span data-start="267.55" data-end="269.229">particularly this one the aesthetics of</span> <span data-start="269.229" data-end="270.729">reading it's great Ani on the screen but</span> <span data-start="270.729" data-end="272.59">whatever one of the things they proved</span> <span data-start="272.59" data-end="274.479">is that it actually doesn't make a</span> <span data-start="274.479" data-end="275.53">difference if you're reading good</span> <span data-start="275.53" data-end="277.449">typography or bad typography you still</span> <span data-start="277.449" data-end="279.099">retain the same information you still</span> <span data-start="279.099" data-end="282.61">read the same speed so like about</span> <span data-start="282.61" data-end="283.81">typography doesn't slow you down good</span> <span data-start="283.81" data-end="285.28">typography doesn't make your job of</span> <span data-start="285.28" data-end="286.27">reading easier</span> <span data-start="286.27" data-end="288.07">so you're kind of like alright well</span> <span data-start="288.07" data-end="290.32">that's sort of weird um but this thing</span> <span data-start="290.32" data-end="292.57">study also proved that or found that</span> <span data-start="292.57" data-end="294.25">good typography induces a good mood and</span> <span data-start="294.25" data-end="295.36">that's probably something you've heard</span> <span data-start="295.36" data-end="297.19">quoted before a lot of a lot of tight</span> <span data-start="297.19" data-end="298.87">people like to bring it up but what they</span> <span data-start="298.87" data-end="300.43">found which i think is really cool is</span> <span data-start="300.43" data-end="302.53">they gave people something to read and</span> <span data-start="302.53" data-end="304.24">they had like their one section of</span> <span data-start="304.24" data-end="305.53">people read something that was set in</span> <span data-start="305.53" data-end="307.33">bad typography but they gave them like a</span> <span data-start="307.33" data-end="308.71">present first they're like here you go</span> <span data-start="308.71" data-end="310.539">here's a present go read this bad</span> <span data-start="310.539" data-end="312.76">typography and at the end those people</span> <span data-start="312.76" data-end="314.32">were in just as good of a mood or the</span> <span data-start="314.32" data-end="316.18">same good mood as the people who were</span> <span data-start="316.18" data-end="318.039">given no present but got to read good</span> <span data-start="318.039" data-end="320.889">typography so the obvious conclusion is</span> <span data-start="320.889" data-end="322.539">good typography is like giving your</span> <span data-start="322.539" data-end="326.77">users are present right but I mean maybe</span> <span data-start="326.77" data-end="329.11">not that literal but it's actually true</span> <span data-start="329.11" data-end="330.82">having good typography puts people in a</span> <span data-start="330.82" data-end="333.19">good mood makes you look better and you</span> <span data-start="333.19" data-end="334.63">know having people in a good mood having</span> <span data-start="334.63" data-end="336.699">people more you know thinking more</span> <span data-start="336.699" data-end="338.02">highly of you is a pretty good thing to</span> <span data-start="338.02" data-end="340.449">gain by good typography and of course a</span> <span data-start="340.449" data-end="342.4">little bit of time on typography will</span> <span data-start="342.4" data-end="344.11">give you really really great results if</span> <span data-start="344.11" data-end="345.46">you spend even just a few minutes at any</span> <span data-start="345.46" data-end="346.75">point in time in your process or any</span> <span data-start="346.75" data-end="349.06">point in your process you'll get some</span> <span data-start="349.06" data-end="350.74">really good results and it's not</span> <span data-start="350.74" data-end="353.05">something that you even need to be you</span> <span data-start="353.05" data-end="355.24">know a type typography expert for just</span> <span data-start="355.24" data-end="356.47">by paying attention to a few the things</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.47" data-end="358.09">I'll list out you're gonna be so much</span> <span data-start="358.09" data-end="359.86">more awesomer at typography and that's</span> <span data-start="359.86" data-end="363.909">awesome ur is totally a word but</span> <span data-start="363.909" data-end="365.289">responsive web design has totally</span> <span data-start="365.289" data-end="366.34">changed the way we think about web</span> <span data-start="366.34" data-end="368.68">typography um you know suddenly we were</span> <span data-start="368.68" data-end="369.88">doing this thing where we're setting</span> <span data-start="369.88" data-end="371.889">type that's what you call it you and if</span> <span data-start="371.889" data-end="373.3">it's CSS and stuff studying type because</span> <span data-start="373.3" data-end="375.55">we were serious type people as web</span> <span data-start="375.55" data-end="376.99">designers now even though one day we</span> <span data-start="376.99" data-end="378.15">weren't now we</span> <span data-start="378.15" data-end="382.09">um not that I'm scarred by that or</span> <span data-start="382.09" data-end="384.94">anything so we're suddenly putting type</span> <span data-start="384.94" data-end="386.29">in these containers that can change any</span> <span data-start="386.29" data-end="387.4">size at any time and we're basically</span> <span data-start="387.4" data-end="389.11">like making our sites and containers do</span> <span data-start="389.11" data-end="390.61">this all the time and we're gonna throw</span> <span data-start="390.61" data-end="393.13">type in there and we're doing it on</span> <span data-start="393.13" data-end="395.77">purpose so we used to set up our tower</span> <span data-start="395.77" data-end="397.81">style rules for type just once right we</span> <span data-start="397.81" data-end="398.92">just set them once to be like we're done</span> <span data-start="398.92" data-end="400.66">it's a fixed container it's good and if</span> <span data-start="400.66" data-end="402.34">we do that now you know we just set our</span> <span

data-end="421.36">is completely horrible and no one would</span> <span data-start="421.36" data-end="422.44">ever want to read it like it's</span> <span data-start="422.44"

clearly that's where I'm going</span> <span data-start="495.73" data-end="497.98">with a list like this so what can we do</span> <span data-start="497.98" data-end="500.68">to bring more more

is</span> <span data-start="506.41" data-end="509.35">to set a scale because consistency makes</span> <span data-start="509.35" data-end="510.279">you look good</span> <span data-start="510.279" data-end="512.86">and the first thing everyone says when I</span> <span data-start="512.86" data-end="514.719">talk about a typographic scale is that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="514.719" data-end="516.099">Robert bring her said you should use one</span> <span data-start="516.099" data-end="519.639">right of course totally heard that and</span> <span

data-end="529.389">listen to this now so I have an even</span> <span data-start="529.389" data-end="530.74">better reason and that's the consistency</span> <span data-start="530.74" data-end="533.319">factor the idea of keeping a consistent</span> <span data-start="533.319" data-end="535.839">look to your type really makes you look</span> <span data-start="535.839" data-end="537.279">way more professional looks things more</span> <span data-start="537.279" data-end="539.5">planned out and more composed and that</span> <span data-start="539.5"

<span data-start="579.67" data-end="583.48">awesome so has anyone has anyone here</span> <span data-start="583.48" data-end="585.16">worked with typographic scales before a</span> <span

data-end="594.309">typographic scale is really just a ratio</span> <span data-start="594.309" data-end="596.47">and this one is the golden ratio which I</span> <span data-start="596.47"

anyways um it's</span> <span data-start="610.3" data-end="611.47">basically a ratio where you take a</span> <span data-start="611.47" data-end="613.36">certain you know you multiply the</span> <span

data-end="632.86">decimals and M's are totally okay and</span> <span data-start="632.86" data-end="633.939">you would get these numbers from</span> <span data-start="633.939"

data-end="638.259">multiplication but I like to get them</span> <span data-start="638.259" data-end="640.66">from modular scale comm which is a tool</span> <span data-start="640.66"

and I'll do all this</span> <span data-start="644.58" data-end="646.32">multiplication for you it'll give you</span> <span data-start="646.32" data-end="648.51">sizes and pixels M's based sixteen

data-start="652.8" data-end="655.56">percent of thirteen is and these scales</span> <span data-start="655.56" data-end="656.82">that have as much meaning or as little</span> <span data-start="656.82"

data-end="661.35">like oh and I picked this scale because</span> <span data-start="661.35" data-end="663.36">it was like based off a major fifth</span> <span data-start="663.36" data-end="665.37">and this font was designed by Beethoven</span> <span data-start="665.37" data-end="668.279">or something I made that up and it was</span> <span data-start="668.279" data-end="670.35">horrible but you know that they had</span> <span data-start="670.35" data-end="671.67">these crazy stories about why they</span> <span data-start="671.67" data-end="673.32">picked his scale and that those are</span> <span data-start="673.32" data-end="674.55">great stories but that's not an</span> <span data-start="674.55" data-end="676.77">important part of picking a scale if you</span> <span data-start="676.77" data-end="678.42">pick a typographic scale and you want to</span> <span data-start="678.42" data-end="680.07">use it because you like it and it looks</span> <span data-start="680.07" data-end="681.36">good and it fits what you're trying to</span> <span data-start="681.36" data-end="683.85">do that's enough reason for me you don't</span> <span data-start="683.85" data-end="685.08">have to have you can make up a story</span> <span data-start="685.08" data-end="686.279">like that if you want but you don't have</span> <span data-start="686.279" data-end="689.43">to have have a story like that and one</span> <span data-start="689.43" data-end="690.87">other thing about scales is that scales</span> <span data-start="690.87" data-end="693.45">or not gospel basically you get this</span> <span data-start="693.45" data-end="694.86">list of numbers and you can use those to</span> <span data-start="694.86" data-end="696.24">assign your different type sizes you</span> <span data-start="696.24" data-end="698.399">know pick your size pure H to use your H</span> <span data-start="698.399"

<p><span data-start="701.459" data-end="704.07">Oh apparently have to go through this</span> <span data-start="704.07" data-end="704.94">way if you're looking at a scale like</span> <span data-start="704.94" data-end="706.95">this and you decide like oh you know I</span> <span data-start="706.95" data-end="709.41">decided my h2s we're gonna be 25 pixels</span> <span data-start="709.41" data-end="711.66">in size but I'd really like them to be</span> <span data-start="711.66" data-end="713.339">just a little bit smaller don't throw</span> <span data-start="713.339" data-end="714.839">out your scale just set it to like 22</span> <span data-start="714.839" data-end="717.42">and be fine with it because you as a</span> <span data-start="717.42" data-end="719.07">human with eyes and a brain are smarter</span> <span data-start="719.07" data-end="720.54">than straight-up math anytime when it</span> <span data-start="720.54" data-end="721.8">comes to what looks right and what looks</span> <span data-start="721.8" data-end="724.11">more balanced so you can always fudge</span> <span data-start="724.11" data-end="726.51">them a little for the human factor all</span> <span data-start="726.51" data-end="727.77">right so that's what we can do for</span> <span data-start="727.77" data-end="729.81">consistency and scales if you haven't</span> <span data-start="729.81" data-end="731.43">used them or typographic scales despite</span> <span data-start="731.43" data-end="732.72">them sounding may be a little bit weird</span> <span data-start="732.72" data-end="735.5">are pretty darn awesome to use for that</span> <span data-start="735.5" data-end="738.81">um so what can we do to typeset well in</span> <span data-start="738.81" data-end="740.73">our containers are flexing all over the</span> <span data-start="740.73" data-end="745.17">darn place so um there's three main</span> <span data-start="745.17" data-end="746.459">things we need to consider when it comes</span> <span data-start="746.459" data-end="748.5">to balancing readable type or keeping</span> <span data-start="748.5" data-end="750.66">type readable and if I was like an</span> <span data-start="750.66" data-end="752.37">infomercial right now I would have like</span> <span data-start="752.37" data-end="753.75">well actually already did have flash</span> <span data-start="753.75" data-end="755.399">bulbs and little explosions didn't I</span> <span data-start="755.399" data-end="757.589">well I have more of those and I probably</span> <span data-start="757.589" data-end="759.63">tell you like I could sell you for $9.99</span> <span data-start="759.63" data-end="761.49">the three secrets to like setting type</span> <span data-start="761.49" data-end="763.89">and well three secrets to setting</span> <span data-start="763.89" data-end="765.6">readable type but I'm not gonna get that</span> <span data-start="765.6" data-end="767.37">crazy with it because that's sort of</span> <span data-start="767.37" data-end="769.29">silly but there's three things that are</span> <span data-start="769.29" data-end="771.51">kind of considered the I guess macro</span> <span data-start="771.51" data-end="773.1">typography or something like that the</span> <span data-start="773.1" data-end="773.97">three things you will need to have</span> <span data-start="773.97" data-end="775.61">imbalance to keep type readable</span> <span data-start="775.61" data-end="778.85">- sighs second is letting and the third</span> <span data-start="778.85" data-end="780.53">is measure those are the super</span> <span data-start="780.53" data-end="782.87">typographic names for them in CSS they</span> <span data-start="782.87" data-end="786.47">are font size line height and width yay</span> <span data-start="786.47" data-end="788.42">so those three things looking at just</span> <span data-start="788.42" data-end="789.62">those three things you can get stuff</span> <span data-start="789.62" data-end="792.34">looking amazingly readable very easily</span> <span data-start="792.34" data-end="794.66">when a body of text is hard to read one</span> <span data-start="794.66" data-end="796.16">of these three things is out of whack so</span> <span data-start="796.16" data-end="799.01">they all are kind of related do do and</span> <span data-start="799.01" data-end="800.81">as you kind of adjust them with their</span> <span data-start="800.81" data-end="802.28">fancy little faders you can pretend</span> <span data-start="802.28" data-end="803.84">that's what we're really doing if you're</span> <span data-start="803.84" data-end="806.06">just any one of them or change any one</span> <span data-start="806.06" data-end="807.38">of them especially drastically if you</span> <span data-start="807.38" data-end="808.85">need to adjust the other two to make</span> <span data-start="808.85" data-end="810.5">something that's still more balanced and</span> <span data-start="810.5" data-end="812.39">the relationship isn't like a linear</span> <span data-start="812.39" data-end="814.28">mathematical thing it's not like well if</span> <span

data-end="821">it's nothing that literal and that</span> <span data-start="821" data-end="823.1">linear it's more just by you know when</span> <span data-start="823.1" data-end="824.18">you adjust one you have to get your</span> <span data-start="824.18" data-end="826.16">balance back and the goal isn't really</span> <span data-start="826.16" data-end="827.6">like black and white rules of like this</span> <span data-start="827.6" data-end="829.61">is better it's more of just a goal of</span> <span data-start="829.61" data-end="831.44">creating something that's in good taste</span> <span

data-end="839.87">also according to Robert burgers the</span> <span data-start="839.87" data-end="842.06">optimal length or the most optimal</span> <span data-start="842.06" data-end="843.11">length for a comfortable measure of</span> <span data-start="843.11" data-end="845.09">reading is 45 to 75 characters I</span> <span data-start="845.09" data-end="846.53">probably heard that sometimes too it</span> <span data-start="846.53" data-end="848.96">comes up kind of a lot that's considered</span> <span data-start="848.96" data-end="850.25">a comfortable measure for reading line</span> <span data-start="850.25" data-end="852.98">length on the Internet I've noticed that</span> <span data-start="852.98" data-end="854.87">we've kind of changed just a little bit</span> <span

data-end="868.34">things are actually still pretty easy to</span> <span data-start="868.34" data-end="872.57">read so 45 ish to 100 or 45 to 75 up to</span> <span data-start="872.57"

suggesting that you know</span> <span data-start="2141.339" data-end="2142.809">all fonts have some hinting included</span> <span data-start="2142.809" data-end="2144.039">with them and that's basically</span> <span data-start="2144.039" data-end="2145.119">instructions of how to make their</span> <span data-start="2145.119" data-end="2148.029">awesome smooth curves translate to</span> <span data-start="2148.029" data-end="2150.88">coarse harsh pixels and how that's gonna</span> <span data-start="2150.88" data-end="2153.009">happen and hinting tells them how to do</span> <span data-start="2153.009" data-end="2155.619">that but he suggested it maybe hinting</span> <span data-start="2155.619" data-end="2157.96">could do more than that like what if the</span> <span

data-start="2168.609" data-end="2171.16">version um so that kind of things those</span> <span data-start="2171.16" data-end="2173.14">kinds of things could be actually</span> <span data-start="2173.14" data-end="2174.91">embedded within our fonts and our fonts</span> <span data-start="2174.91" data-end="2176.41">could be smart enough you know we</span> <span data-start="2176.41" data-end="2177.43">wouldn't have to swap them out ourselves</span> <span data-start="2177.43" data-end="2179.859">they could actually no I think that's</span> <span data-start="2179.859"
