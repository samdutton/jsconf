<p><span data-start="45.76" data-end="48.879">I quickly became bored with the very</span> <span data-start="48.879" data-end="51.039">slow pace of the projects at that time</span> <span data-start="51.039" data-end="53.02">you know things when you're making</span> <span data-start="53.02" data-end="56.02">buildings it takes years to complete so</span> <span data-start="56.02" data-end="57.19">I wanted to be in a more innovative</span> <span data-start="57.19" data-end="59.32">space and I decided that that would be</span> <span data-start="59.32" data-end="62.8">tech so to get my foot in the door I</span> <span data-start="62.8" data-end="66.7">started doing I started working as a</span> <span data-start="66.7" data-end="69.52">community specialist for a startup and</span> <span data-start="69.52" data-end="71.56">that meant that I was actually just</span> <span data-start="71.56" data-end="73.869">doing customer support for a company</span> <span data-start="73.869" data-end="76.44">that was around for about 10 years I</span> <span data-start="76.44" data-end="79.119">totally totally hated it and so I</span> <span data-start="79.119" data-end="82.27">decided to teach myself to code I would</span> <span data-start="82.27" data-end="85.06">work on my projects at nights I would go</span> <span data-start="85.06" data-end="87.729">to hack my hackathons and I just kept</span> <span data-start="87.729" data-end="89.83">working on these things and eventually</span> <span data-start="89.83" data-end="93.16">that led to success and I landed my</span> <span data-start="93.16" data-end="95.739">first job as a front-end developer at a</span> <span data-start="95.739" data-end="102.61">company called hot pads yay so here we</span> <span data-start="102.61" data-end="105.16">go my first assignment at hot pads was</span> <span data-start="105.16" data-end="108.25">to redesign all of our emails and make</span> <span data-start="108.25" data-end="110.02">them responsive and I was like oh yeah</span> <span data-start="110.02" data-end="113.739">no problem super easy right I started</span> <span data-start="113.739" data-end="115.629">working them on those emails and I</span> <span data-start="115.629" data-end="118.3">thought oh crap I have no idea what I'm</span> <span data-start="118.3" data-end="122.41">doing but fortunately i'm here to share</span> <span data-start="122.41" data-end="124.81">all of my strategies and mistakes with</span> <span data-start="124.81" data-end="128.89">you all so my story is about how emails</span> <span data-start="128.89" data-end="131.26">are evil which I'm sure many of you can</span> <span data-start="131.26" data-end="132.58">relate to if you've ever worked on</span> <span data-start="132.58" data-end="134.709">responsive emails so I'll talk a bit</span> <span data-start="134.709" data-end="136.3">about design</span> <span data-start="136.3" data-end="138.07">food and I'll share some resources that</span> <span data-start="138.07" data-end="142.87">i found along the way so to start I'm</span> <span data-start="142.87" data-end="145.84">going to talk about design so first</span> <span data-start="145.84" data-end="147.52">things first when I was working on</span> <span data-start="147.52" data-end="149.8">hotpads they asked me to redesign their</span> <span data-start="149.8" data-end="154.18">welcome email and i decided to first</span> <span data-start="154.18" data-end="155.77">start by doing a bunch of research so i</span> <span data-start="155.77" data-end="157.75">signed up for a ton of different</span> <span data-start="157.75" data-end="159.46">services just so i could look at their</span> <span data-start="159.46" data-end="163.36">welcome emails I thought the prettiest</span> <span data-start="163.36" data-end="165.25">email that i found was actually in d</span> <span data-start="165.25" data-end="169.08">gogos which we can take a look at here</span> <span data-start="169.08" data-end="176.68">very quickly oh there we go so the first</span> <span data-start="176.68" data-end="178.3">thing I notice about this email is they</span> <span data-start="178.3" data-end="180.28">have this top anchored logo so you know</span> <span data-start="180.28" data-end="182.17">exactly where the emails coming from and</span> <span data-start="182.17" data-end="184.81">as they move down the page I see a lot</span> <span data-start="184.81" data-end="186.79">of really beautiful image content and</span> <span data-start="186.79" data-end="189.1">notice that all their calls to action</span> <span data-start="189.1" data-end="191.47">are the same color so I can just click</span> <span data-start="191.47" data-end="194.59">on these buttons on these pink links and</span> <span data-start="194.59" data-end="196.33">also i can click on the images which is</span> <span data-start="196.33" data-end="201.34">great so keep scrolling down and then I</span> <span data-start="201.34" data-end="202.87">also notice that there they have these</span> <span data-start="202.87" data-end="205.12">social media buttons but also they have</span> <span data-start="205.12" data-end="206.83">links in text and that's really great</span> <span data-start="206.83" data-end="209.29">for accessibility and then I also see of</span> <span data-start="209.29" data-end="211.9">course a way to unsubscribe and update</span> <span data-start="211.9" data-end="217.51">your subscription so some of the</span> <span data-start="217.51" data-end="219.25">takeaways that I found in doing all the</span> <span data-start="219.25" data-end="221.38">research and again I received many many</span> <span data-start="221.38" data-end="223.9">welcome emails was that most of them</span> <span data-start="223.9" data-end="226.18">were very text light many of them were</span> <span data-start="226.18" data-end="229.54">very image heavy there was always a logo</span> <span data-start="229.54" data-end="231.72">there at the very top of the email and</span> <span data-start="231.72" data-end="234.16">also max-width so you didn't have your</span> <span data-start="234.16" data-end="238.84">users reading across the page a quick</span> <span data-start="238.84" data-end="241.18">disclaimer about all those things so</span> <span data-start="241.18" data-end="243.04">they may not work for everybody and I</span> <span data-start="243.04" data-end="244.36">highly recommend if you're working on</span> <span data-start="244.36" data-end="246.37">emails is to a/b tests all of your</span> <span data-start="246.37" data-end="250.989">emails so after doing that research I</span> <span data-start="250.989" data-end="253.269">decided to check out what our welcome</span> <span data-start="253.269" data-end="257.079">email looked like get ready</span> <span data-start="257.079" data-end="259.419">this is what it looked like the first</span> <span data-start="259.419" data-end="261.159">thing I notice I'm like why is our logo</span> <span data-start="261.159" data-end="263.259">kind of right in the middle of our email</span> <span data-start="263.259" data-end="266.699">what's with all that weird spacing and</span> <span data-start="266.699" data-end="270.699">why is there text after our closing for</span> <span data-start="270.699" data-end="272.439">like welcome on board but then we add on</span> <span data-start="272.439" data-end="274.15">a bunch of stuff at the end and then</span> <span data-start="274.15" data-end="278.169">there's also no way to unsubscribe so</span> <span data-start="278.169" data-end="280.15">seeing that email I felt very much like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.15" data-end="285.729">Doge was like wow just wow all right so</span> <span data-start="285.729" data-end="288.31">next up I decided to plan and I was like</span> <span data-start="288.31" data-end="290.469">what am I making what am i doing for hot</span> <span data-start="290.469" data-end="294.009">pads so I had a couple of goals and</span> <span data-start="294.009" data-end="295.719">those two things were to bring</span> <span data-start="295.719" data-end="298.419">consistency to our emails our emails</span> <span data-start="298.419" data-end="299.83">were just all over the place they all</span> <span data-start="299.83" data-end="302.65">look different they all looked crazy so</span> <span data-start="302.65" data-end="304.569">I wanted to really give them a more</span> <span data-start="304.569" data-end="307.3">formalized template and I thought that</span> <span data-start="307.3" data-end="308.65">that would bring a lot of brand</span> <span data-start="308.65" data-end="310.509">awareness because once you see that</span> <span data-start="310.509" data-end="312.94">recognizable template you know where</span> <span data-start="312.94" data-end="317.529">your emails are coming from so to make</span> <span data-start="317.529" data-end="320.74">or not to make I decided or I checked</span> <span data-start="320.74" data-end="322.84">out the internet and saw that there are</span> <span data-start="322.84" data-end="324.639">a ton of pre-made email templates that</span> <span data-start="324.639" data-end="326.889">you can use so you don't actually have</span> <span data-start="326.889" data-end="328.84">to build them from scratch and they can</span> <span data-start="328.84" data-end="331.539">be quite helpful but I actually didn't</span> <span data-start="331.539" data-end="333.25">use them personally and there are a few</span> <span data-start="333.25" data-end="336.279">reasons for that those reasons being</span> <span data-start="336.279" data-end="338.83">that it was my first project as a</span> <span data-start="338.83" data-end="340.36">front-end developer and I really wanted</span> <span data-start="340.36" data-end="343">to get you know in the nitty-gritty of</span> <span data-start="343" data-end="345.31">the code and so I actually built up our</span> <span data-start="345.31" data-end="348.129">template from scratch if you guys have</span> <span data-start="348.129" data-end="349.569">less time to work on your emails</span> <span data-start="349.569" data-end="351.49">pre-made templates can be a really great</span> <span data-start="351.49" data-end="356.529">way to go on when designing emails it</span> <span data-start="356.529" data-end="358.659">can be really great to sketch so here</span> <span data-start="358.659" data-end="360.25">you can see I've sketched the same email</span> <span data-start="360.25" data-end="362.379">four different times and that just gives</span> <span data-start="362.379" data-end="363.94">you a sense of where you want to lay</span> <span data-start="363.94" data-end="365.469">things out and that can really help</span> <span data-start="365.469" data-end="367.87">before your coding especially if you</span> <span data-start="367.87" data-end="371.319">don't have a designer Photoshop can be</span> <span data-start="371.319" data-end="373.719">really great if you have the skills I</span> <span data-start="373.719" data-end="377.79">definitely say go for it</span> <span data-start="377.8" data-end="379.569">another thing I wanted to think about</span> <span data-start="379.569" data-end="382.419">when I was planning was what I call our</span> <span data-start="382.419" data-end="384.46">role of thumbs or the minimum touchable</span> <span data-start="384.46" data-end="387.729">area on mobile devices so I had often</span> <span data-start="387.729" data-end="392.5">heard of the number 44 x 44 pixels it</span> <span data-start="392.5" data-end="394.629">turns out that number is wrong it comes</span> <span data-start="394.629" data-end="397.539">from the original iphone human interface</span> <span data-start="397.539" data-end="400.24">guidelines for the very first iphone and</span> <span data-start="400.24" data-end="401.53">those guidelines don't even exist</span> <span data-start="401.53" data-end="405.389">anymore so just so you know actually all</span> <span data-start="405.389" data-end="408.009">mobile devices have a different minimum</span> <span data-start="408.009" data-end="409.78">touchable area so i've linked to these</span> <span data-start="409.78" data-end="412.12">two pages here and they definitely help</span> <span data-start="412.12" data-end="415.06">you figure out what that size is and</span> <span data-start="415.06" data-end="417.49">it's really dependent on what devices</span> <span data-start="417.49" data-end="422.86">are most popular with your users so here</span> <span data-start="422.86" data-end="424.69">is the new template for our welcome</span> <span data-start="424.69" data-end="428.639">email that I created I like to say it's</span> <span data-start="428.639" data-end="433.33">a design for the new millennium in the</span> <span data-start="433.33" data-end="437.71">year 2000 so the design I can see is</span> <span data-start="437.71" data-end="439.449">like a little bit outdated but this is</span> <span data-start="439.449" data-end="440.83">actually what our website looks like</span> <span data-start="440.83" data-end="443.68">back then and so I was obviously pulling</span> <span data-start="443.68" data-end="447.06">some design cues from our website and</span> <span data-start="447.06" data-end="449.77">just for comparison this is what our old</span> <span data-start="449.77" data-end="456.05">emails look like and versus the new one</span> <span data-start="456.06" data-end="459.31">all right on to some code so here's a</span> <span data-start="459.31" data-end="460.81">bunch of tips and tricks that I learned</span> <span data-start="460.81" data-end="464.71">along the way so some things that I</span> <span data-start="464.71" data-end="466.449">learned before I started coding our</span> <span data-start="466.449" data-end="473.629">emails number one tables are coming</span> <span data-start="473.639" data-end="476.83">mozilla developers network says note</span> <span data-start="476.83" data-end="480.52">prior to the creation of CSS HTML table</span> <span data-start="480.52" data-end="482.469">elements were often used as a message</span> <span data-start="482.469" data-end="485.65">for page layout this usage has been</span> <span data-start="485.65" data-end="488.56">discouraged since HTML 4 and the table</span> <span data-start="488.56" data-end="490.81">element should not be used for layout</span> <span data-start="490.81" data-end="498.16">purposes email say Lowell</span> <span data-start="498.17" data-end="500.73">tables are really important in emails if</span> <span data-start="500.73" data-end="502.98">you don't have a rapper table in your</span> <span data-start="502.98" data-end="504.93">email it actually makes all of your code</span> <span data-start="504.93" data-end="508.17">disappear in Apple Mail and outlook 2011</span> <span data-start="508.17" data-end="512.469">so make sure you have that outer table</span> <span data-start="512.479" data-end="514.83">something I also found out was that</span> <span data-start="514.83" data-end="517.95">tables don't display as inline or block</span> <span data-start="517.95" data-end="520.89">or inline block and I was like what what</span> <span data-start="520.89" data-end="522.96">does that mean well table is actually</span> <span data-start="522.96" data-end="526.23">default to display as table but in that</span> <span data-start="526.23" data-end="528.36">case chrome actually will ignore a max</span> <span data-start="528.36" data-end="530.52">wits that you said on your emails so you</span> <span data-start="530.52" data-end="532.08">definitely want to set your table to</span> <span data-start="532.08" data-end="537.81">display as block next up is inline</span> <span data-start="537.81" data-end="541.23">styles you definitely need them reason</span> <span data-start="541.23" data-end="543.27">being gmail doesn't support of style on</span> <span data-start="543.27" data-end="545.85">the head outlook.com doesn't support a</span> <span data-start="545.85" data-end="548.13">link element in the head and many</span> <span data-start="548.13" data-end="550.65">clients don't support a whole like bevy</span> <span data-start="550.65" data-end="554.07">and slew of CSS so a really great page</span> <span data-start="554.07" data-end="556.76">to help you know what is supported is</span> <span data-start="556.76" data-end="560.7">campaign monitor CSS page here what you</span> <span data-start="560.7" data-end="563.46">see here is a really great chart which</span> <span data-start="563.46" data-end="565.38">shows all of these different email</span> <span data-start="565.38" data-end="568.08">clients and what's supported what CSS is</span> <span data-start="568.08" data-end="571.53">supported in them so unfortunately</span> <span data-start="571.53" data-end="572.73">you're going to be doing a whole lot of</span> <span data-start="572.73" data-end="575.49">this if you're designing emails it's</span> <span data-start="575.49" data-end="578.85">really ugly I know but it's got to</span> <span data-start="578.85" data-end="583.83">happen all right again back to max width</span> <span data-start="583.83" data-end="586.56">so I think that this company didn't get</span> <span data-start="586.56" data-end="588.72">the memo on max width and you see that</span> <span data-start="588.72" data-end="590.73">their text just kind of goes all the way</span> <span data-start="590.73" data-end="592.26">across the screen and it just makes it</span> <span data-start="592.26" data-end="595.65">really hard to read so it's important to</span> <span data-start="595.65" data-end="597.41">set a max width on your email and</span> <span data-start="597.41"
