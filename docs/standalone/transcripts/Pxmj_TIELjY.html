<p><span data-start="358.99" data-end="361.69">UI and then describe the functionality</span> <span data-start="361.69" data-end="363.76">that we want that depends on that now if</span> <span data-start="363.76" data-end="365.8">we have another application like that</span> <span data-start="365.8" data-end="367.87">adds some bonus functionality so we can</span> <span data-start="367.87" data-end="375.969">look at that real quick so it's</span> <span data-start="375.979" data-end="378.69">okay so this is like added functionality</span> <span data-start="378.69" data-end="381.69">from the previous application we have</span> <span data-start="381.69" data-end="385.53">another HTML page with another HTML</span> <span data-start="385.53" data-end="388.199">bonus page that loads bonus shares from</span> <span data-start="388.199" data-end="389.639">getting remove the production it's going</span> <span data-start="389.639" data-end="393.15">to work yeah and then we have the bonus</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="393.15" data-end="395.039">GS that it loads and that just loads the</span> <span data-start="395.039" data-end="396.81">other application and adds whatever</span> <span data-start="396.81" data-end="398.91">functionality it wants its just really I</span> <span data-start="398.91" data-end="400.889">mean this is just a very basic example</span> <span data-start="400.889" data-end="403.259">but you see the syntax for loading</span> <span data-start="403.259" data-end="404.849">dependencies and then and then running</span> <span data-start="404.849"

those dependencies and just compress</span> <span data-start="410.4" data-end="415.45">them so if we compress this application</span> <span data-start="415.46" data-end="420.87">you compress jsu just point it to our</span> <span data-start="420.87" data-end="424.53">page can open the page in MGAs see every</span> <span data-start="424.53" data-end="428.039">script tag that's loading so this is

data-start="438.599" data-end="440.099">to switch to the production bill that</span> <span data-start="440.099" data-end="441.84">this is going to is going to make it's</span> <span data-start="441.84" data-end="443.61">really easy now we just do that comma</span> <span data-start="443.61" data-end="446.789">production so that's basically steel</span> <span data-start="446.789" data-end="449.76">made compressing and building your big</span> <span data-start="449.76" data-end="451.5">jQuery apps and doing dependency is</span> <span data-start="451.5" data-end="456.3">really easy so the next thing I'm going</span> <span data-start="456.3" data-end="458.55">to talk about is continue with this</span> <span data-start="458.55" data-end="460.889">theme of we're just very lazy developers</span> <span data-start="460.889" data-end="463.349">is the code generators what do you want</span> <span data-start="463.349" data-end="464.07">to do when you start building</span> <span

to be readable and you know just not</span> <span data-start="592.019" data-end="594.879">and basically legible so what we picked</span> <span data-start="594.879" data-end="597.699">is class this is

data-end="665.589">to pull back data and then maybe you'll</span> <span data-start="665.589" data-end="667.509">want to massage that data a little bit</span> <span data-start="667.509" data-end="669.97">to prepare it for the view or prepare</span> <span data-start="669.97" data-end="673.329">it put in the page or modify the Dom so</span> <span data-start="673.329" data-end="675.31">what we realize is if you can break</span> <span data-start="675.31" data-end="677.91">apart an application in these four parts</span> <span data-start="677.91" data-end="681.16">it

<span data-start="691.42" data-end="694.72">almost any JavaScript functionality this</span> <span data-start="694.72" data-end="696.1">is how we kind of do it so to use this</span> <span

data-end="711.43">that more in a little bit and then you</span> <span data-start="711.43" data-end="713.98">want to wrap that service layer with</span> <span data-start="713.98"

data-end="730.089">want some domain specific functionality</span> <span data-start="730.089" data-end="731.889">on it right you want a little bit more</span> <span data-start="731.889" data-end="733.87">information than just the raw services</span> <span data-start="733.87" data-end="735.579">giving you like if you want to know if</span> <span data-start="735.579"

that use a client site template</span> <span data-start="747.91" data-end="751.12">to insert that into the dot this is this</span> <span data-start="751.12" data-end="754.089">is pretty basic now a lot of people</span> <span data-start="754.089" data-end="755.709">rightfully should be thinking right now</span> <span data-start="755.709" data-end="759.16">well all this takes like three lines of</span> <span data-start="759.16" data-end="761.439">jQuery code why are we turning it into</span> <span data-start="761.439" data-end="763.149">this light into this mess right here</span> <span

data-end="768.97">writing like and some of the apps that</span> <span data-start="768.97" data-end="769.899">we've worked on where they're like</span> <span data-start="769.899" data-end="771.48">hundreds of thousands of lines of code</span> <span data-start="771.48" data-end="774.009">it becomes a mess and you want to be</span> <span data-start="774.009"

data-end="1100.29">work so a hypothetical to do controller</span> <span data-start="1100.29" data-end="1103.05">would kind of work like this so you</span> <span data-start="1103.05" data-end="1104.43">would first find all your to do's from</span> <span data-start="1104.43" data-end="1106.92">your service that you would then you</span> <span data-start="1106.92" data-end="1108.42">would show them and cert them into the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1108.42" data-end="1111.33">Dom because controller knows the name of</span> <span data-start="1111.33" data-end="1113.52">the controller and the action the show</span> <span data-start="1113.52" data-end="1114.96">actions ended it's in it can</span> <span data-start="1114.96" data-end="1117.54">automatically kind of like rails by</span> <span data-start="1117.54" data-end="1119.1">convention know where to look up the</span> <span data-start="1119.1" data-end="1121.89">view without you telling it to and then</span> <span data-start="1121.89" data-end="1123.3">in the view you'll loop through all the</span> <span data-start="1123.3" data-end="1125.07">to do's and you'll spit them in the page</span> <span data-start="1125.07" data-end="1127.8">with the template the real interesting</span> <span data-start="1127.8" data-end="1131.22">part is is this little bit yeah by</span> <span data-start="1131.22" data-end="1132.87">inserting something that's not a string</span> <span data-start="1132.87" data-end="1135.84">it knows to put that in the jQuery data</span> <span data-start="1135.84" data-end="1137.82">so that it later there it's really easy</span> <span data-start="1137.82" data-end="1139.2">to look up so when it comes time to</span> <span data-start="1139.2" data-end="1144.93">delete a single element right we listen</span> <span data-start="1144.93" data-end="1148.23">to delete click when that happens we</span> <span data-start="1148.23" data-end="1150.66">just basically go up one element to our</span> <span data-start="1150.66" data-end="1153.15">div and then we can get our model really</span> <span data-start="1153.15" data-end="1155.04">easy and then call destroy on that model</span> <span data-start="1155.04" data-end="1157.95">it's like that easy right it's it's</span> <span data-start="1157.95" data-end="1160.47">really simple so then because we use</span> <span data-start="1160.47" data-end="1163.98">open Ajax like published messages that</span> <span data-start="1163.98" data-end="1165.09">are the result of all our service</span> <span data-start="1165.09" data-end="1167.34">requests we don't have to if we had</span> <span data-start="1167.34" data-end="1169.05">multiple of these to do which it's on</span> <span data-start="1169.05" data-end="1171.3">the page and you delete one to do that</span> <span data-start="1171.3" data-end="1172.71">was shown another place while you just</span> <span data-start="1172.71" data-end="1174.84">subscribe to the delete of that to do</span> <span data-start="1174.84" data-end="1176.88">and it will remove itself automatically</span> <span data-start="1176.88" data-end="1179.28">all right there's just like little tions</span> <span data-start="1179.28" data-end="1181.59">that you're always constantly doing that</span> <span data-start="1181.59" data-end="1183.15">get handled because you're using this</span> <span data-start="1183.15" data-end="1186.27">a.m MVC approach all right so the next</span> <span data-start="1186.27" data-end="1188.31">thing is testing and this is really</span> <span data-start="1188.31" data-end="1190.23">really important and this is the coolest</span> <span data-start="1190.23" data-end="1191.58">thing I think to come out of the third</span> <span data-start="1191.58" data-end="1194.13">version of JavaScript MVC it's because</span> <span data-start="1194.13" data-end="1198.24">testing just sucks so bad right I look</span> <span data-start="1198.24" data-end="1201.66">is it noise selenium is awesome but it's</span> <span data-start="1201.66" data-end="1202.45">still</span> <span data-start="1202.45" data-end="1205.27">sucks so does all testing solutions</span> <span data-start="1205.27" data-end="1206.83">until now but you guys could say that my</span> <span data-start="1206.83" data-end="1210.43">sucks too so the problem with each</span> <span data-start="1210.43" data-end="1211.78">testing solution there's like three main</span> <span data-start="1211.78" data-end="1213.01">ways there's like a browser-based</span> <span data-start="1213.01" data-end="1216.43">testing which is like qunit and that is</span> <span data-start="1216.43" data-end="1219.01">really easy to write but it's manually</span> <span data-start="1219.01" data-end="1220.54">driven all right you got to stand there</span> <span data-start="1220.54" data-end="1221.92">and open each browser and test it</span> <span data-start="1221.92" data-end="1224.29">there's the simulated browser</span> <span data-start="1224.29" data-end="1226.39">environments like MJ s there's a bunch</span> <span data-start="1226.39" data-end="1227.86">of others those are really nice but</span> <span data-start="1227.86" data-end="1229.6">they're not really high fidelity because</span> <span data-start="1229.6" data-end="1231.43">it's not the real browser running but</span> <span data-start="1231.43" data-end="1233.77">it's fast so you can get like good gut</span> <span data-start="1233.77" data-end="1235.54">check if your codes really working and</span> <span data-start="1235.54" data-end="1238">then there's the like selenium the</span> <span data-start="1238" data-end="1240.49">browser drivers these actually pop open</span> <span data-start="1240.49" data-end="1242.82">browsers and then run your tests on them</span> <span data-start="1242.82" data-end="1245.59">those do have high fidelity but the</span> <span data-start="1245.59" data-end="1248.2">problem is very hard to write like</span> <span data-start="1248.2" data-end="1249.52">they're hard to write tests kind of hard</span> <span data-start="1249.52" data-end="1250.9">to debug test because sometimes it</span> <span data-start="1250.9" data-end="1252.16">happened so fast you came and see what's</span> <span data-start="1252.16" data-end="1256">going on so it's really needed is it</span> <span data-start="1256" data-end="1259.21">tier 2 you had a question ok if there</span> <span data-start="1259.21" data-end="1260.17">anybody is a question just raise your</span> <span data-start="1260.17" data-end="1265.93">hand sorry I should I said every way so</span> <span data-start="1265.93" data-end="1267.28">what we mean is funk unit and it's</span> <span data-start="1267.28" data-end="1269.13">really a tiered approach it kind of has</span> <span data-start="1269.13" data-end="1273.22">all of these parts in it but a really</span> <span data-start="1273.22" data-end="1275.41">nice asynchronous syntax that you can</span> <span data-start="1275.41" data-end="1277.63">write one test and it runs in in the</span> <span data-start="1277.63" data-end="1279.61">browser it runs an end and it runs in</span> <span data-start="1279.61" data-end="1281.47">selenium so the syntax look something</span> <span data-start="1281.47" data-end="1284.71">like this it's based on cue units syntax</span> <span data-start="1284.71" data-end="1287.17">but it's also kind of based on jQuery</span> <span data-start="1287.17" data-end="1289.63">too so you basically select something</span> <span data-start="1289.63" data-end="1291.4">this would test like a numeric txt bak</span> <span data-start="1291.4" data-end="1294.09">you can only enter in numbers all right</span> <span data-start="1294.09" data-end="1296.29">look at it's pretty basic you click on</span> <span data-start="1296.29" data-end="1302.41">it you you type in 27 it doesn't write</span> <span data-start="1302.41" data-end="1303.91">anything like it should and then you</span> <span data-start="1303.91" data-end="1307.21">type 27 the numbers and it has 27 it's</span> <span data-start="1307.21" data-end="1309.64">really easy unfortunate fortunately we</span> <span data-start="1309.64" data-end="1311.65">were we had a great enough client who</span> <span data-start="1311.65" data-end="1316.81">let us show some example of this running</span> <span data-start="1316.81" data-end="1317.98">that if we just started working on this</span> <span data-start="1317.98" data-end="1322.75">prototype for them so it's running all</span> <span data-start="1322.75" data-end="1325.54">the tests in the browser so if you look</span> <span data-start="1325.54" data-end="1328.36">at the funk unit page okay so this is I</span> <span data-start="1328.36" data-end="1330.64">mean it is qunit it's just we've added</span> <span data-start="1330.64" data-end="1333.16">this ability to like drive another page</span> <span data-start="1333.16" data-end="1336.039">with qunit so you can open another page</span> <span data-start="1336.039" data-end="1338.44">then click on things really easy so okay</span> <span data-start="1338.44" data-end="1340.749">we looks like real quick at the code for</span> <span data-start="1340.749" data-end="1347.259">what that looks like so basic okay so</span> <span data-start="1347.259" data-end="1348.399">this is what the code for that looks</span> <span data-start="1348.399" data-end="1349.299">like just like what we're looking at</span> <span data-start="1349.299" data-end="1351.519">before right opens a page clicks on it</span> <span data-start="1351.519" data-end="1354.249">check something exists check something</span> <span data-start="1354.249" data-end="1356.47">else exists then gets a text for it they</span> <span data-start="1356.47" data-end="1357.759">say sit the reason why it's kind of like</span> <span data-start="1357.759" data-end="1359.049">a synchronous like this it handles</span> <span data-start="1359.049" data-end="1360.22">asynchronous behavior really well you</span> <span data-start="1360.22" data-end="1361.479">can call weights because it basically</span> <span data-start="1361.479" data-end="1363.22">compiles the list of commands is going</span> <span data-start="1363.22" data-end="1367.899">to make and then runs them so we can run</span> <span data-start="1367.899" data-end="1373.009">this in selenium really really easy so</span> <span data-start="1373.019" data-end="1375.249">just the script this automatically is</span> <span data-start="1375.249" data-end="1377.499">integrated with JavaScript MVC so this</span> <span data-start="1377.499" data-end="1379.629">is going to open up this will take a</span> <span data-start="1379.629" data-end="1381.7">second or two this is going to open up</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1381.7" data-end="1395.259">IE and then run those tests in IE so</span> <span data-start="1395.259" data-end="1397.269">this is all automated right so you can</span> <span data-start="1397.269" data-end="1399.609">actually just trigger a command and have</span> <span data-start="1399.609" data-end="1401.95">nightly builds run all this every night</span> <span data-start="1401.95" data-end="1404.169">but then be able but the awesome part</span> <span data-start="1404.169" data-end="1405.369">about it is I mean selenium can already</span> <span data-start="1405.369" data-end="1407.47">do this the awesome part is you can open</span> <span data-start="1407.47" data-end="1409.299">this up in your browser and debug it</span> <span data-start="1409.299" data-end="1412.69">right like you can you can have Firebug</span> <span data-start="1412.69" data-end="1414.399">hit an error and like see what the</span> <span data-start="1414.399" data-end="1417.309">heck's going on oh boy this is really</span> <span data-start="1417.309" data-end="1422.619">slow okay we can just it'll just show</span> <span data-start="1422.619" data-end="1426.509">some okays we could just cancel it then</span> <span data-start="1426.509" data-end="1428.679">yeah this is this is why i said it's</span> <span data-start="1428.679" data-end="1436.389">slow yeah so I should have mention that</span> <span data-start="1436.389" data-end="1437.71">every through this Third Point no</span> <span data-start="1437.71" data-end="1439.119">release it hasn't come out quite yet</span> <span data-start="1439.119" data-end="1440.32">we're trying to like the next week and a</span> <span

data-end="1445.45">everything some things obviously depend</span> <span data-start="1445.45" data-end="1447.549">on jQuery but phone Canyon won't depend</span> <span data-start="1447.549" data-end="1450.549">on jQuery and steel won't depend on</span> <span data-start="1450.549" data-end="1451.359">jQuery but we're trying to make</span> <span data-start="1451.359" data-end="1454.629">everything is useful as possible for as</span> <span data-start="1454.629" data-end="1457.539">many people as possible it's a hook so</span> <span data-start="1457.539" data-end="1461.59">eventually he'll okay so that's funk</span> <span data-start="1461.59" data-end="1464.289">unit damn it is just a javascript error</span> <span data-start="1464.289" data-end="1468.159">reporting service a real quick demo this</span> <span data-start="1468.159" data-end="1469.17">causes an error</span> <span data-start="1469.17" data-end="1471.45">cause an air this will this is just a</span> <span data-start="1471.45" data-end="1472.8">really simple script that you can clue</span> <span data-start="1472.8" data-end="1474.39">your pages that detect errors and then</span> <span data-start="1474.39" data-end="1477">send will email you when an error</span> <span data-start="1477" data-end="1479.16">happens or prompt the user to type in</span> <span data-start="1479.16" data-end="1483.84">what happened so so that just sent</span> <span data-start="1483.84" data-end="1485.91">there's just sentiment air and the</span> <span data-start="1485.91" data-end="1489.12">message so that's pretty nice you can</span> <span data-start="1489.12" data-end="1490.86">use this it's a it's an open source free</span> <span data-start="1490.86" data-end="1494.67">service document j/s there's been a lot</span> <span data-start="1494.67" data-end="1496.41">of awesome documentation engines coming</span> <span data-start="1496.41" data-end="1498.78">out recently ours is based on Remy</span> <span data-start="1498.78" data-end="1501.3">sharps it looks like really sharps you</span> <span data-start="1501.3" data-end="1504.14">document it with j s stock type stuff</span> <span data-start="1504.14" data-end="1509.58">looks like this you can search really</span> <span data-start="1509.58" data-end="1514.71">basic I don't it's nice okay go to the</span> <span data-start="1514.71" data-end="1518.25">next so then the final two pieces that</span> <span data-start="1518.25" data-end="1520.47">were kind of releasing back as a bunch</span> <span data-start="1520.47" data-end="1523.89">of jQuery extensions and widgets we wish</span> <span data-start="1523.89" data-end="1527.97">it so first the on widgets there's a</span> <span data-start="1527.97" data-end="1529.29">milk we're releasing a bunch of widgets</span> <span data-start="1529.29" data-end="1531.18">but they have like everybody's release</span> <span data-start="1531.18" data-end="1532.8">the same type of widgets over and over</span> <span data-start="1532.8" data-end="1533.88">and over again so what we're going to</span> <span data-start="1533.88" data-end="1538.08">try to do this is a an idea a lot from</span> <span data-start="1538.08" data-end="1540.99">yahoo de cats and ben almond i've talked</span> <span data-start="1540.99" data-end="1543.24">a lot about with this is a vent oriented</span> <span data-start="1543.24" data-end="1545.61">architecture for widgets so the idea is</span> <span data-start="1545.61" data-end="1548.07">what if your widgets were like the Dom</span> <span data-start="1548.07" data-end="1549.66">like the Dom actually provided like a</span> <span data-start="1549.66" data-end="1553.11">tab widget so the idea is like you could</span> <span data-start="1553.11" data-end="1558.99">click on a tab you click on the tab and</span> <span data-start="1558.99" data-end="1561.68">then it might trigger a hide request on</span> <span data-start="1561.68" data-end="1564.51">another div and then you can listen to</span> <span data-start="1564.51" data-end="1566.43">that and then prevent default prevent</span> <span data-start="1566.43" data-end="1569.25">the actual hiding of it and then if you</span> <span data-start="1569.25" data-end="1570.72">didn't it would call show and then you</span> <span data-start="1570.72" data-end="1572.94">could listen to show and do any complex</span> <span data-start="1572.94" data-end="1574.74">functionality you want the ideas we want</span> <span data-start="1574.74" data-end="1576.81">to provide a very small sub reusable</span> <span data-start="1576.81" data-end="1579.03">subset of like an event system for your</span> <span data-start="1579.03" data-end="1581.7">widgets and that you can add any crazy</span> <span data-start="1581.7" data-end="1583.71">custom functionality on you want on</span> <span data-start="1583.71" data-end="1585.15">because I feel a big problem with</span> <span data-start="1585.15" data-end="1586.92">current widget libraries is that they're</span> <span data-start="1586.92" data-end="1588.57">like monolithic they have to every</span> <span data-start="1588.57" data-end="1591.03">feature under the Sun because there's</span> <span data-start="1591.03" data-end="1593.22">not a great way always to like get in</span> <span data-start="1593.22" data-end="1595.8">there and make changes so this is fuii</span> <span data-start="1595.8" data-end="1598.41">we got like this is this is all</span> <span data-start="1598.41" data-end="1600.6">prototype right now this isn't like</span> <span data-start="1600.6" data-end="1601.89">coming out anytime</span> <span data-start="1601.89" data-end="1603.75">next week or so but you're really</span> <span data-start="1603.75" data-end="1605.85">interesting one I was taking some time</span> <span data-start="1605.85" data-end="1610.35">to load isn't it so we got a lot of</span> <span data-start="1610.35" data-end="1613.35">jQuery UI ones done but the interest</span> <span data-start="1613.35" data-end="1615.18">rate one is menu so just by this basic</span> <span data-start="1615.18" data-end="1617.67">menu right here we're able to add like a</span> <span data-start="1617.67" data-end="1619.98">lot of different type of crazy menus so</span> <span data-start="1619.98" data-end="1622.8">if you scroll down a navigation so this</span> <span data-start="1622.8" data-end="1626.7">is just that menu but we've mixed in a</span> <span data-start="1626.7" data-end="1629.04">shiftable class that listens to like</span> <span data-start="1629.04" data-end="1631.53">open and close and a fade in and fade</span> <span data-start="1631.53" data-end="1633.21">out a bowl class that that listens to</span> <span data-start="1633.21" data-end="1635.07">open and close so it allows you to like</span> <span data-start="1635.07" data-end="1636.84">mix in other things that with snow</span> <span data-start="1636.84" data-end="1641.19">events it's a crazy brainstorming idea</span> <span data-start="1641.19" data-end="1642.87">but with that same menu then we created</span> <span data-start="1642.87" data-end="1645.99">tabs and we have like a toolbar but all</span> <span data-start="1645.99" data-end="1647.82">of these stuff use their like exact same</span> <span data-start="1647.82" data-end="1652.56">base code event system code so okay and</span> <span data-start="1652.56" data-end="1654.48">as you can tell we're really into event</span> <span data-start="1654.48" data-end="1657.06">or in architecture so we're have a bunch</span> <span data-start="1657.06" data-end="1658.89">of jQuery extensions we're going to put</span> <span data-start="1658.89" data-end="1661.08">out so these are really just a lot very</span> <span data-start="1661.08" data-end="1663">similar in functionality to a lot of the</span> <span data-start="1663" data-end="1665.1">jQuery UI ones the difference is is like</span> <span data-start="1665.1" data-end="1669.96">for drag and drop the source instead of</span> <span data-start="1669.96" data-end="1671.94">like having a plug-in do drag and drop</span> <span data-start="1671.94" data-end="1673.62">you just bind to the event drag and drop</span> <span data-start="1673.62" data-end="1675.06">and it works with live and things like</span> <span data-start="1675.06" data-end="1677.58">that so we had history select all these</span> <span data-start="1677.58" data-end="1680.13">different ones but well history is</span> <span data-start="1680.13" data-end="1681.72">integrated that's actually been almonds</span> <span data-start="1681.72" data-end="1684.42">but it's integrated in a funny way and</span> <span data-start="1684.42" data-end="1686.52">then Chavez going to be see provides a</span> <span data-start="1686.52" data-end="1693.15">bunch of other helpers so so it's oh so</span> <span data-start="1693.15" data-end="1695.1">the last thing I'd like to do Java sort</span> <span data-start="1695.1" data-end="1697.17">of EC really dependent on a lot of like</span> <span data-start="1697.17" data-end="1700.65">to get its fix a lot of other people's</span> <span data-start="1700.65" data-end="1702.6">work so these are really the dealers</span> <span data-start="1702.6" data-end="1705.06">that help juice up JavaScript MVC and</span> <span data-start="1705.06"
