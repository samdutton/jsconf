data-end="153.84">you know a lot of times the best case</span> <span data-start="153.84" data-end="156.36">scenario is to just set up a you know</span> <span data-start="156.36" data-end="157.86">staging server that all of your</span> <span data-start="157.86" data-end="160.8">front-end developers hit and eventually</span> <span data-start="160.8" data-end="162.18">you're going to run into some problems</span> <span data-start="162.18" data-end="165.45">where the the developers on their</span> <span data-start="165.45" data-end="167.73">laptops don't have the information that</span> <span data-start="167.73" data-end="169.89">they need just based on the on what's</span> <span data-start="169.89" data-end="172.05">being exposed to them over the wire so</span> <span data-start="172.05" data-end="174.959">that's where TV comes in so as I said TV</span> <span data-start="174.959" data-end="177.42">is an interactive debug console and this</span> <span data-start="177.42" data-end="179.48">is a kind of blurry screenshot of it</span> <span data-start="179.48" data-end="181.83">about i'll be showing a demo in a minute</span> <span data-start="181.83" data-end="184.02">and so what quick left has been doing</span> <span data-start="184.02" data-end="185.85">over the past few months is taking a</span> <span data-start="185.85" data-end="187.53">look at the use cases behind TV and</span> <span data-start="187.53" data-end="189.57">doing some some redesigned some</span> <span data-start="189.57" data-end="193.02">rethinking so again it's an interactive</span> <span data-start="193.02" data-end="195.57">debug console and it's gotten a bit of a</span> <span data-start="195.57" data-end="199.17">facelift so the old TV is about as</span> <span data-start="199.17" data-end="200.82">pretty as you can possibly make a table</span> <span data-start="200.82" data-end="204.72">look so it's a little bit daunting when</span> <span data-start="204.72" data-end="206.28">you first get there it doesn't do</span> <span data-start="206.28" data-end="209.13">anything out of the box so it's a it was</span> <span data-start="209.13" data-end="210.6">a little bit challenging when I when I</span> <span data-start="210.6" data-end="212.43">first picked this up and being like okay</span> <span data-start="212.43" data-end="213.959">well I can kind of see what's going on</span> <span data-start="213.959" data-end="216.45">you know their tags grouped in but you</span> <span data-start="216.45" data-end="218.459">know it's difficult discover it's</span> <span data-start="218.459" data-end="220.47">difficult to filter and unless you</span> <span data-start="220.47" data-end="223.41">really kind of go through you know this</span> <span data-start="223.41" data-end="226.11">process of creating a debug ID and then</span> <span data-start="226.11" data-end="227.459">making sure that you're sending that</span> <span data-start="227.459" data-end="230.07">along is a query parameter along with</span> <span data-start="230.07" data-end="232.59">everyone your requests filtering down</span> <span data-start="232.59" data-end="234.209">just the stuff that year that you want</span> <span data-start="234.209" data-end="236.04">to look at is a little bit challenging</span> <span data-start="236.04" data-end="239.64">so along the way there were a whole</span> <span data-start="239.64" data-end="241.86">bunch of new features that that we were</span> <span data-start="241.86" data-end="244.59">able to add and in a pretty pretty easy</span> <span data-start="244.59" data-end="246.78">way so things like type-ahead filtering</span> <span data-start="246.78" data-end="249.269">favoriting copying to clipboard so that</span> <span data-start="249.269" data-end="252.09">if you do have you know kind of server</span> <span data-start="252.09" data-end="254.25">logging information or error logs you</span> <span data-start="254.25" data-end="255.93">know it makes it super easy to just pick</span> <span data-start="255.93" data-end="258.03">that stuff up drop it and drop it into</span> <span data-start="258.03" data-end="259.95">chat and send it off to the API</span> <span data-start="259.95" data-end="262.229">developers who are working diligently to</span> <span data-start="262.229" data-end="264.539">maintain this public staging server that</span> <span data-start="264.539" data-end="266.62">you're working against every day</span> <span data-start="266.62" data-end="269.169">better user onboarding a real pause and</span> <span data-start="269.169" data-end="270.85">resume so that if you do if you are</span> <span data-start="270.85" data-end="272.71">developing against the staging service</span> <span data-start="272.71" data-end="275.29">that is quite busy you can actually tell</span> <span data-start="275.29" data-end="276.82">it to shut the up for a couple</span> <span data-start="276.82" data-end="279.34">minutes and it's all built for happy</span> <span data-start="279.34" data-end="282.22">eight-point oh now so a little bit of</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="288.639">demo time here ok cool so so this is TV</span> <span data-start="288.639" data-end="290.71">my screen is not mirrored so this is a</span> <span data-start="290.71" data-end="293.47">little old tricky so what we're seeing</span> <span data-start="293.47" data-end="296.02">right now is is a live web socket</span> <span data-start="296.02" data-end="298.21">connection to a server we have running</span> <span data-start="298.21" data-end="302.44">over here and what we can see is that as</span> <span data-start="302.44" data-end="304.66">requests come in to the server that are</span> <span data-start="304.66" data-end="307.3">tagged with this debug

data-start="311.77" data-end="313.99">here you can see that we have custom law</span> <span data-start="313.99" data-end="315.94">custom logging coming through that has</span> <span data-start="315.94" data-end="318.449">our own tags associated with it that</span> <span data-start="318.449" data-end="321.31">would unfold if it were actually JSON</span> <span data-start="321.31" data-end="325.93">you get has some some internal logging</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="328.449">events from happy and the same type of</span> <span data-start="328.449" data-end="330.49">response payload stuff this isn't</span> <span data-start="330.49" data-end="333.13">necessarily meant to replace your your</span> <span data-start="333.13" data-end="335.34">network panel and the in the debug tools</span> <span data-start="335.34" data-end="337.87">but it can really be helpful if you're</span> <span data-start="337.87" data-end="339.669">just trying to get to the bottom of</span> <span data-start="339.669" data-end="342.76">where request is why you're getting 404</span> <span data-start="342.76" data-end="345.669">is on a certain endpoint and you know</span>
