expressed</span> <span data-start="300.599" data-end="303.99">it but then like I always like found out</span> <span data-start="303.99" data-end="306.15">later on that the most of them were just</span> <span data-start="306.15" data-end="307.8">as stressed as me and didn't like to</span> <span data-start="307.8" data-end="310.289">understand everything and some stuff</span> <span

data-end="334.5">syndrome because like you don't know</span> <span data-start="334.5" data-end="335.819">everything and you're constantly</span> <span data-start="335.819" data-end="339.27">learning and like I just had this</span> <span data-start="339.27" data-end="341.61">nagging fear that I was not good enough</span> <span data-start="341.61" data-end="343.59">programmer and expected it would just</span> <span data-start="343.59" data-end="347.55">you know go away after I graduated but</span> <span data-start="347.55" data-end="351.06">then it kind of didn't and I studied</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.06" data-end="353.639">Android programming the first time it</span> <span data-start="353.639" data-end="356.4">was taught here in Iceland 2009 to 10</span> <span data-start="356.4" data-end="359.219">and then i graduated in 2010 and i</span> <span data-start="359.219" data-end="362.639">started to work on Android and PHP if</span> <span data-start="362.639" data-end="364.789">you remember left programming limits but</span> <span data-start="364.789" data-end="367.409">mostly enter it and you know date</span> <span data-start="367.409" data-end="369.3">another android program on the sides and</span> <span data-start="369.3" data-end="372.779">then in 2012 i was approached by an</span> <span data-start="372.779"

data-end="387.15">like worldwide success and they</span> <span data-start="387.15" data-end="389.219">approached me because like i was the</span> <span data-start="389.219" data-end="391.349">most experienced the most experienced</span> <span data-start="391.349" data-end="394.5">android programmers in Iceland which</span> <span data-start="394.5" data-end="396.389">might sound cool but i thought it was</span> <span data-start="396.389" data-end="398.31">terrifying because i did not feeling</span> <span data-start="398.31" data-end="401.31">like I was left experienced but I</span> <span data-start="401.31" data-end="403.889">accepted the job of course it was really</span> <span data-start="403.889" data-end="406.379">exciting and we were just six at a time</span> <span data-start="406.379" data-end="408.96">and the company grew up to 80 people in</span> <span data-start="408.96" data-end="412.08">two years and yeah games like really</span> <span data-start="412.08" data-end="414.32">worldwide huge success</span> <span data-start="414.32" data-end="417.81">and even after a couple of years and I</span> <span data-start="417.81" data-end="419.81">was a part of this whole process really</span> <span data-start="419.81" data-end="423.69">deep into the development and and</span> <span data-start="423.69" data-end="428.13">everything I you know I still was always</span> <span data-start="428.13" data-end="429.84">afraid that you know someday they would</span> <span data-start="429.84" data-end="431.37">find out that I did not know what I was</span> <span data-start="431.37" data-end="433.62">doing and somehow I always assumed that</span> <span data-start="433.62" data-end="435.41">everybody else knew what they were doing</span> <span data-start="435.41" data-end="441.24">which is maybe not correct so about two</span> <span data-start="441.24" data-end="445.2">years ago I had had a massive burnet at</span> <span data-start="445.2" data-end="447.45">my work and started to you know some</span> <span data-start="447.45" data-end="449.76">soul-searching I guess you can say and</span> <span data-start="449.76" data-end="453.33">then

data-end="471.51">you know me being like an insecure woman</span> <span data-start="471.51" data-end="473.82">but this was just like a Sherman can</span> <span data-start="473.82" data-end="478.44">happen to our and anyone so yeah that</span> <span data-start="478.44" data-end="480.3">was great but like van in the past two</span> <span data-start="480.3" data-end="483.78">years I've done some things I feel that</span> <span data-start="483.78" data-end="486.12">have helped me overcome the imposter</span> <span data-start="486.12" data-end="488.19">syndrome and I wanted to

data-end="513.36">said no and you know what problems have</span> <span data-start="513.36" data-end="516.51">you solved then projects you have done</span> <span data-start="516.51" data-end="518.58">and know what new things have you</span> <span data-start="518.58" data-end="520.89">learned and like I'll promise you you'll</span> <span data-start="520.89" data-end="523.32">realize that you have a big part in your</span> <span data-start="523.32" data-end="527.7">success and then recognize your</span> <span data-start="527.7" data-end="532.98">strengths

data-end="564.22">you know people that really excel in</span> <span data-start="564.22" data-end="566.68">what they're doing but unrealistic</span> <span data-start="566.68" data-end="569.17">comparison doesn't really doesn't really</span> <span data-start="569.17" data-end="572.8">help so if we would just focus on your</span> <span data-start="572.8"

<span data-start="595.93" data-end="598.6">that probably means that I won't gain as</span> <span data-start="598.6" data-end="601.03">much knowledge sent you know experience</span> <span
