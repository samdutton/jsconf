this what what would you send a</span> <span data-start="250.44" data-end="253.65">simple JavaScript actually you could</span> <span data-start="253.65" data-end="256.799">write an image tag with any

data-start="261.12" data-end="265.04">forgot your name sorry for that</span> <span data-start="265.05" data-end="267.37">some of the most important concepts when</span> <span data-start="267.37" data-end="270.91">it comes to dom exercise we have two</span> <span data-start="270.91" data-end="272.56">very very critical things that you</span> <span data-start="272.56" data-end="275.17">really think of source and sings that's</span> <span data-start="275.17" data-end="277.27">the simplest thing what is the source a</span> <span data-start="277.27" data-end="280.9">source is a point of entry for a ten</span> <span data-start="280.9" data-end="284.11">third input via malicious user what it</span> <span data-start="284.11" data-end="286.33">effectively means is these are places</span> <span data-start="286.33" data-end="288.82">which a malicious user can send input</span> <span data-start="288.82" data-end="291.94">into the application itself as simple as</span> <span data-start="291.94" data-end="295.21">that and what is a sink a sink is when</span> <span data-start="295.21" data-end="296.83">you take this and manipulate the Dom</span> <span data-start="296.83" data-end="300.13">it's as simple as that so one of the</span> <span data-start="300.13" data-end="302.38">fundamentals things that when I was</span> <span data-start="302.38" data-end="304.21">learning security probably a 10 years</span> <span data-start="304.21" data-end="306.52">back a very good gentlemen taught me a</span> <span data-start="306.52" data-end="309.04">simple principle security issues can be</span> <span data-start="309.04" data-end="312.01">divided into two sets when data becomes</span> <span data-start="312.01" data-end="314.47">code you have a major problem and when</span> <span data-start="314.47" data-end="316.6">code becomes data it's as simple as that</span> <span data-start="316.6" data-end="318.43">all security issues can go into these</span> <span data-start="318.43" data-end="320.56">two lines effectively if you really</span> <span data-start="320.56" data-end="322.9">think about it here most of the</span> <span data-start="322.9" data-end="324.55">important component is there are ways</span> <span data-start="324.55" data-end="327.28">there are Dom API is which allow that a</span> <span data-start="327.28" data-end="329.74">user input which a string can be</span> <span data-start="329.74" data-end="331.6">converted into a dorm component itself</span> <span data-start="331.6" data-end="333.55">that's what the fundamental problem</span> <span data-start="333.55" data-end="336.34">comes in and this where Dom exercis is</span> <span data-start="336.34" data-end="343">all about a very good location of what</span> <span data-start="343" data-end="344.41">are the source and sink says I have just</span> <span data-start="344.41" data-end="347.05">put up a very small laundry list not the</span> <span data-start="347.05" data-end="348.64">biggest one I would actually suggest</span> <span data-start="348.64" data-end="350.23">that you could go to the dharmic census</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="350.23" data-end="352.11">Vicky it has a more exhaustive</span> <span data-start="352.11" data-end="354.19">information on what are the different</span> <span data-start="354.19" data-end="356.5">sources what are the different things</span> <span data-start="356.5" data-end="359.89">that are available but if you really</span> <span data-start="359.89" data-end="361.63">think about it I want to spend two</span> <span data-start="361.63" data-end="365.07">minutes here to talk about some of the</span> <span data-start="365.07" data-end="369.25">evac pretty much dead nobody uses evil</span> <span data-start="369.25" data-end="371.77">these days while in my demos I have used</span> <span data-start="371.77" data-end="375.16">evil because it's easier but if you</span> <span data-start="375.16" data-end="377.86">really look out a set timeout and the</span> <span data-start="377.86" data-end="380.29">function constructor can also execute</span> <span data-start="380.29" data-end="384.39">code these also can be used as Tom sinks</span> <span data-start="384.39" data-end="386.71">that's something that keeps missing all</span> <span data-start="386.71" data-end="388.51">and the eternal most important is the</span> <span data-start="388.51" data-end="391.54">inner HTML and outer HTML these could be</span> <span data-start="391.54" data-end="393.01">effectively be used to change your Dom</span> <span data-start="393.01" data-end="395.28">which is why it's a sink there</span> <span data-start="395.28" data-end="398.88">okay now let's get into the actual fun</span> <span data-start="398.88" data-end="401.4">of things recently I was been testing</span> <span data-start="401.4" data-end="403.77">one of an application wherein we found</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="403.77" data-end="408.21">Adamek sucess but there were two</span> <span data-start="408.21" data-end="410.31">scenarios that were noticed here it was</span> <span data-start="410.31" data-end="412.8">basically said that the application or</span> <span data-start="412.8" data-end="415.56">this bug is detected only inside an</span> <span data-start="415.56" data-end="418.23">authenticated session we take care of a</span> <span data-start="418.23" data-end="420.63">lot of security controls in there the</span> <span data-start="420.63" data-end="423.419">application cannot be put inside I frame</span> <span data-start="423.419" data-end="424.95">so that you cannot do and self only</span> <span data-start="424.95" data-end="426.24">exercise and stuff like that so</span> <span data-start="426.24" data-end="428.46">effectively saying that hey this is a</span> <span data-start="428.46" data-end="430.56">very low priority bug here yes we agreed</span> <span data-start="430.56" data-end="433.38">sir bug but it's not a bug and the other</span> <span data-start="433.38" data-end="434.97">thing that they told me was we</span> <span data-start="434.97" data-end="436.38">understand this is the file upload which</span> <span data-start="436.38" data-end="437.61">is what I showed you a few minutes back</span> <span data-start="437.61" data-end="441.45">and they said it's a file name what will</span> <span data-start="441.45" data-end="444.24">you do maximum with this all the special</span> <span data-start="444.24" data-end="446.19">characters that you need to put inside a</span> <span data-start="446.19" data-end="448.26">file name or blocked by the operating</span> <span data-start="448.26" data-end="450.63">system how would you even create an</span> <span data-start="450.63" data-end="453.93">exploit around this so this were the two</span> <span data-start="453.93" data-end="455.46">challenges that season the problem is</span> <span data-start="455.46" data-end="456.87">that the developers did not tell me it's</span> <span data-start="456.87" data-end="458.82">a nota but they don't know yes we will</span> <span data-start="458.82" data-end="460.62">fix this issue but it's a very low</span> <span data-start="460.62" data-end="462.81">priority issue the problem with the low</span> <span data-start="462.81" data-end="464.729">priority issues it gets pushed off and</span> <span data-start="464.729" data-end="467.79">it gets slower to come in and the</span> <span data-start="467.79" data-end="469.62">application needs to go life and I was</span> <span data-start="469.62" data-end="472.44">worried that it could compromise so I</span> <span data-start="472.44" data-end="476.88">had to create an exploit before we go to</span> <span data-start="476.88" data-end="478.86">win let me show you a demo of the actual</span> <span data-start="478.86" data-end="485.13">exploitation itself so I basically</span> <span data-start="485.13" data-end="488.01">created a test application because I</span> <span data-start="488.01" data-end="489.539">can't show you the actual application</span> <span data-start="489.539" data-end="492.24">itself a lot of legalities and stuff</span> <span data-start="492.24" data-end="493.62">like that I can't show you the actual</span> <span data-start="493.62" data-end="496.229">application so let me show you a simple</span> <span data-start="496.229" data-end="499.59">thing pretty much similar like this</span> <span data-start="499.59" data-end="508.02">we're in a user would take a a file name</span> <span data-start="508.02" data-end="510.45">and the file name was being reflected so</span> <span data-start="510.45" data-end="512.01">what the developer did was he just took</span> <span data-start="512.01" data-end="514.68">the file name he trusted it and he just</span> <span data-start="514.68" data-end="516.539">placed it on the DOM and effectively it</span> <span data-start="516.539" data-end="518.61">created a cross-site scripting

<span data-start="648.33" data-end="650.85">if you look at this how did I solve the</span> <span data-start="650.85" data-end="652.65">problem the two problems that were there</span> <span

<p><span data-start="724.23" data-end="725.97">I had to do was if you look at the first</span> <span data-start="725.97" data-end="729.51">one I changed evil 2 is equal to eval</span> <span

data-end="736.71">browser started putting in could be just</span> <span data-start="736.71" data-end="740.86">bypassed using a simple fix like that</span> <span data-start="740.87" data-end="744.29">that was what the first exploit was</span> <span data-start="744.29" data-end="749.04">moving on JavaScript templating engines</span> <span data-start="749.04" data-end="751.89">so these days we have to work with a lot</span> <span data-start="751.89" data-end="754.47">of templating engines some of it are not</span> <span data-start="754.47" data-end="758.46">necessarily the top

data-end="769.92">jason and the developer has basically</span> <span data-start="769.92" data-end="773.279">said that there are patterns within that</span> <span data-start="773.279"

data-end="786.67">placeholders are going to be changed and</span> <span data-start="786.68" data-end="789.149">basically this was a beautiful exploit</span> <span data-start="789.149"
