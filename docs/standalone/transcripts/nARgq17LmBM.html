data-end="119.8">you cut wood so I went to the internet</span> <span data-start="119.8" data-end="122.44">again and it's told me that it was easy</span> <span data-start="122.44" data-end="124.21">to cut along the grain and across the</span> <span data-start="124.21" data-end="126.94">grain I still didn't know what did mean</span> <span data-start="126.94" data-end="128.83">because you know like even Buddha would</span> <span data-start="128.83" data-end="131.05">use nowadays is fake so I'm like I don't</span> <span data-start="131.05" data-end="133.659">know but the internet is amazing it gave</span> <span data-start="133.659" data-end="137.3">me a diagram so it shows you what along</span> <span data-start="137.3" data-end="139.28">close the crime mins so it was like oh</span> <span data-start="139.28" data-end="141.2">yeah those timber people like when they</span> <span data-start="141.2" data-end="142.94">go with the arcs if they go with the</span> <span data-start="142.94" data-end="145.16">arcs across this line is very easy you</span> <span data-start="145.16" data-end="146.69">get your visit up they are cutting a</span> <span data-start="146.69" data-end="148.52">tree that in that direction but you</span> <span data-start="148.52" data-end="150.53">never see them cut on the other action</span> <span data-start="150.53" data-end="151.94">you see them but it takes them longer</span> <span data-start="151.94" data-end="156.32">it's not like one clean cut so the oil</span> <span data-start="156.32" data-end="158.51">interesting fact the internet told me is</span> <span data-start="158.51" data-end="160.43">that the bull is also stronger along the</span> <span data-start="160.43" data-end="163.28">grain so if you give a caretaker one of</span> <span data-start="163.28" data-end="165.14">those plans the first one is going to be</span> <span data-start="165.14" data-end="167.72">harder to kind of like just slicing just</span> <span data-start="167.72" data-end="170.57">one hit the second one which you can't</span> <span data-start="170.57" data-end="172.85">really see very well but it's like cut</span> <span data-start="172.85" data-end="174.62">in the other direction so this is going</span> <span data-start="174.62" data-end="176.75">to break you can see that this is like</span> <span data-start="176.75" data-end="180.59">total set out like if a kratika can cut</span> <span data-start="180.59" data-end="181.85">that you know that it's not a very good</span> <span data-start="181.85" data-end="185.74">caretaker so my car was very interesting</span> <span data-start="185.74" data-end="187.97">another thing that the internet show me</span> <span data-start="187.97" data-end="190.07">is an a demo of days with the spaghetti</span> <span data-start="190.07" data-end="192.5">so you can see this is blood grain</span> <span data-start="192.5" data-end="194.63">fibers and you can see that this is the</span> <span data-start="194.63" data-end="196.22">effect that you will get when you cut</span> <span data-start="196.22" data-end="198.29">with an axe along the direction of the</span> <span data-start="198.29" data-end="203.12">grain so the other final call saying</span> <span data-start="203.12" data-end="204.86">that the internet tell me about both and</span> <span data-start="204.86" data-end="206.989">grains is that you also need to keep</span> <span data-start="206.989" data-end="208.34">this thing in mind when you apply polish</span> <span data-start="208.34" data-end="211.19">or you get these scratches which are</span> <span data-start="211.19" data-end="213.17">awful this is what happens when you can</span> <span data-start="213.17" data-end="215.54">affect some against the direction of the</span> <span data-start="215.54" data-end="218.48">grain sound like this is so cool like</span> <span data-start="218.48" data-end="220.55">the crane is intrinsic to the balls so</span> <span data-start="220.55" data-end="222.2">if you do things properly you can like</span> <span data-start="222.2" data-end="225.35">very nice finish product they are really</span> <span data-start="225.35" data-end="226.97">nice to look at your like oh this is</span> <span data-start="226.97" data-end="229.43">like good artisanal crafty work but if</span> <span data-start="229.43" data-end="230.959">you don't do that if you just ignore the</span> <span data-start="230.959" data-end="232.82">fact that bull has grain you get things</span> <span data-start="232.82" data-end="235.67">that Flint's a scratch or brittle they</span> <span data-start="235.67" data-end="240.17">break and you're like interesting I was</span> <span data-start="240.17" data-end="242.54">like like this I'm a screen like yeah</span> <span data-start="242.54" data-end="245.33">this sounds familiar this is just like</span> <span data-start="245.33"
