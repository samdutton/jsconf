co-founders are also here</span> <span data-start="15.27" data-end="18.81">Ross and Tom is somewhere we are</span> <span data-start="18.81" data-end="20.46">primarily responsible for a framework</span> <span data-start="20.46" data-end="24.119">called cappuccino we just really started</span> <span data-start="24.119" data-end="26.939">latest version 0.8 point 1 I will talk</span> <span data-start="26.939" data-end="28.289">about that a little bit later in the</span> <span data-start="28.289" data-end="31.409">presentation but as Chris said I kind of</span> <span data-start="31.409" data-end="32.759">wanted to do something a little bit</span> <span data-start="32.759" data-end="35.97">differently and kind of talk about what</span> <span data-start="35.97" data-end="38.67">was this kind of passion / side project</span> <span data-start="38.67" data-end="41.67">for us for the past couple of months and</span> <span data-start="41.67" data-end="44.1">has now increasingly become more</span> <span data-start="44.1" data-end="47.37">important as we start preparing for kind</span> <span data-start="47.37" data-end="49.68">of cappuccino one point oh and that is</span> <span data-start="49.68" data-end="53.46">documentation so I think it goes without</span> <span data-start="53.46" data-end="54.78">saying that documentation is really</span> <span data-start="54.78" data-end="57.99">important and I think most documentation</span> <span data-start="57.99" data-end="59.88">of most open source projects kind of</span> <span data-start="59.88" data-end="64.47">sucks ours included and I kind of want</span> <span data-start="64.47" data-end="65.489">to start this with kind of the funny</span> <span data-start="65.489" data-end="67.71">story behind cappuccino documentation so</span> <span data-start="67.71" data-end="69.63">if you go today to keva chino</span> <span data-start="69.63" data-end="70.8">documentation this is kind of what it</span> <span data-start="70.8" data-end="73.44">looks like it's it's your generic open</span> <span data-start="73.44" data-end="75.39">source documentation which is you know</span> <span data-start="75.39" data-end="77.37">we figured out how to use the tool that</span> <span data-start="77.37" data-end="78.69">spits out the method names and that's</span> <span data-start="78.69" data-end="82.65">more or less it there are some places we</span> <span data-start="82.65" data-end="84.32">were able to have some good descriptions</span> <span data-start="84.32" data-end="87.84">generally it's not that great we lucked</span> <span data-start="87.84" data-end="90.51">out however because since cappuccino was</span> <span data-start="90.51" data-end="92.1">based on an existing framework you know</span> <span data-start="92.1" data-end="94.2">we were basically implementing aspect</span> <span data-start="94.2" data-end="96.15">that already exists kind of the open</span> <span data-start="96.15" data-end="97.77">secret in the cappuccino community is</span> <span data-start="97.77" data-end="99.24">that you should never go to our Docs and</span> <span data-start="99.24" data-end="101.07">instead just go to developer apple com</span> <span data-start="101.07" data-end="103.11">and if you want to find out about CP</span> <span data-start="103.11" data-end="104.909">view you just read about NS view and the</span> <span data-start="104.909" data-end="106.86">documentation applies a hundred percent</span> <span data-start="106.86" data-end="109.049">not only that but if those aren't good</span> <span data-start="109.049" data-end="111.03">enough you can just hit the canoe staff</span> <span data-start="111.03" data-end="112.92">documentation which is also pretty darn</span> <span data-start="112.92" data-end="114.84">good and again applies one hundred</span> <span data-start="114.84" data-end="116.67">percent and if that's not good enough</span> <span data-start="116.67" data-end="118.229">then you can hit like all the different</span> <span data-start="118.229" data-end="121.68">cocoa blogs and books and stuff and you</span> <span data-start="121.68" data-end="123.75">know we even today recommend a cup of</span> <span data-start="123.75" data-end="126.119">cocoa books to our users so it we kind</span> <span data-start="126.119" data-end="128.759">of lucked out in this regard but we're</span> <span data-start="128.759" data-end="130.56">trying to change that for one point oh</span> <span data-start="130.56" data-end="133.379">the way I look at it is that we got</span> <span data-start="133.379" data-end="136.26">eighty percent for free like most open</span> <span data-start="136.26" data-end="137.76">source projects you know day one have</span> <span data-start="137.76" data-end="139.12">zero documentation</span> <span data-start="139.12" data-end="140.56">we had like seventy to eighty percent</span> <span data-start="140.56" data-end="142.81">good documentation the problem is</span> <span data-start="142.81" data-end="144.909">achieving that last twenty percent is</span> <span data-start="144.909" data-end="147.459">impossible with this model of oh just</span> <span data-start="147.459" data-end="149.95">disco ask Apple how to do it obviously</span> <span data-start="149.95" data-end="151.42">we can't change their dogs we can't add</span> <span data-start="151.42" data-end="153.67">anything new so we'd really like to do</span> <span data-start="153.67" data-end="155.56">for cappuccino 1 point 0 is have truly</span> <span data-start="155.56" data-end="161.26">world-class documentation and that's</span> <span data-start="161.26" data-end="163.15">kind of a problem because documentation</span> <span data-start="163.15" data-end="164.799">is hard and I think it's particularly</span> <span data-start="164.799" data-end="168.43">hard for any new project especially open</span> <span data-start="168.43" data-end="170.98">source and the reason I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="170.98" data-end="172.329">this here today and the reason Kris</span> <span data-start="172.329" data-end="173.95">asked me to talk about this is that i</span> <span data-start="173.95" data-end="176.68">think our community is at a place where</span> <span data-start="176.68" data-end="178.93">we could really benefit a lot from kind</span> <span data-start="178.93" data-end="181.12">of a revolution and documentation you</span> <span data-start="181.12" data-end="182.59">know we're at a place right now where</span> <span data-start="182.59" data-end="184.48">we're trying to really sell JavaScript</span> <span data-start="184.48" data-end="186.37">to a lot of people being able to do a</span> <span data-start="186.37" data-end="187.569">lot more than it could before you know</span> <span data-start="187.569" data-end="189.22">we're even taking the step of saying you</span> <span data-start="189.22" data-end="190.12">know you should be able to write your</span> <span data-start="190.12" data-end="192.43">servers in JavaScript and to be able to</span> <span data-start="192.43" data-end="193.72">do that to be able to convince people</span> <span data-start="193.72" data-end="196.23">upon kind of an already sketchy idea</span> <span data-start="196.23" data-end="198.25">they need to be able to know how to use</span> <span data-start="198.25" data-end="199.989">this stuff and again the problem with</span> <span data-start="199.989" data-end="201.22">most open source projects is that</span> <span data-start="201.22" data-end="202.75">they're really cool they're really</span> <span data-start="202.75" data-end="205.87">advanced but the documentation is kind</span> <span data-start="205.87" data-end="208.599">of terrible on day one and with these</span> <span data-start="208.599" data-end="209.98">kind of programming problems that have</span> <span data-start="209.98" data-end="211.84">nothing to do with code I think there's</span> <span data-start="211.84" data-end="214.989">a tendency to kind of look at in two</span> <span data-start="214.989" data-end="216.43">different ways one of them is to think</span> <span data-start="216.43" data-end="218.98">it's a cultural problem and this is kind</span> <span data-start="218.98" data-end="220.359">of what the testing community has done</span> <span data-start="220.359" data-end="221.5">right they've said well testing was a</span> <span data-start="221.5" data-end="223.419">cultural problem we have the right tools</span> <span data-start="223.419" data-end="225.069">for testing what we need to do is to</span> <span data-start="225.069" data-end="227.47">build a culture of testing and it's</span> <span data-start="227.47" data-end="230.799">worked out pretty well an example I</span> <span data-start="230.799" data-end="232.569">guess the flip side to that is to say</span> <span data-start="232.569" data-end="234.639">take technological problem and I usually</span> <span data-start="234.639" data-end="237.699">tend to side with that I happen to think</span> <span data-start="237.699" data-end="239.29">that most problems have technical</span> <span data-start="239.29" data-end="241.599">reasons and technical solutions and a</span> <span data-start="241.599" data-end="243.28">good example of that is version control</span> <span data-start="243.28" data-end="245.47">right I think most people are using</span> <span data-start="245.47" data-end="247.48">version control incorrectly not because</span> <span data-start="247.48" data-end="248.65">we had the wrong culture but we had the</span> <span data-start="248.65" data-end="250.51">wrong tools you know when get came out I</span> <span data-start="250.51" data-end="252.879">think all of us started using version</span> <span data-start="252.879" data-end="254.769">control completely differently we all</span> <span data-start="254.769" data-end="257.22">became much better and much more like</span> <span data-start="257.22" data-end="259.479">tightly knit community thanks to that</span> <span data-start="259.479" data-end="261.37">and it was all thanks to just a tool</span> <span data-start="261.37" data-end="263.4">that actually did its job correctly and</span> <span data-start="263.4" data-end="265.57">when I'm proposing today is that I think</span> <span data-start="265.57" data-end="268.419">that we do documentation completely</span> <span data-start="268.419" data-end="270.729">wrong and that's objectively like oh I</span> <span data-start="270.729" data-end="271.39">don't like it</span> <span data-start="271.39" data-end="273.73">but like mathematically provably wrong</span> <span data-start="273.73" data-end="278.34">and I think the main cause of this is</span> <span data-start="278.34" data-end="280.72">documentation and comments that's my</span> <span data-start="280.72" data-end="282.31">thesis for you I'll trying to make it</span> <span data-start="282.31" data-end="284.23">clever and save it to the end but you</span> <span data-start="284.23" data-end="285.58">know when you make your slides a day</span> <span data-start="285.58" data-end="287.82">before that you can't afford to do that</span> <span data-start="287.82" data-end="291.19">so I think that this is the root cause</span> <span data-start="291.19" data-end="293.86">of bad documentation in the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="293.86" data-end="295.06">community in the open source community</span> <span data-start="295.06" data-end="299.26">in most communities in general and so</span> <span data-start="299.26" data-end="300.76">before i get into exactly why that is i</span> <span data-start="300.76" data-end="302.41">want to give you guys a glimpse of how</span> <span data-start="302.41" data-end="304.53">your users for using your products</span> <span data-start="304.53" data-end="306.61">interact with your documentation what</span> <span data-start="306.61" data-end="310.36">the problems are so this is obvious</span> <span data-start="310.36" data-end="311.95">right day one you have no documentation</span> </p>

data-end="805.98">know there's a question where you put</span> <span data-start="805.98" data-end="807.36">this stuff right well if the images and</span> <span data-start="807.36" data-end="808.499">the videos end up in your source repo</span> <span data-start="808.499" data-end="810.959">then all of a sudden you know it takes a</span> <span data-start="810.959"

data-end="822.42">ultimately just like it's hard for the</span> <span data-start="822.42" data-end="824.999">people using your stuff to contribute</span> <span data-start="824.999"

data-end="831.6">can tell you that when i get a commit or</span> <span data-start="831.6" data-end="833.299">like a pull request which is entirely</span> <span data-start="833.299" data-end="836.279">documentation the temptation to ignore</span> <span data-start="836.279" data-end="838.92">forever or you know allow immediately</span> <span data-start="838.92" data-end="840.66">without review is super high and that</span> <span data-start="840.66" data-end="843.989">should not be the case so we're working</span> <span data-start="843.989" data-end="845.91">on this new tool close to product we're</span> <span data-start="845.91" data-end="848.1">not done we're specifically announcing</span> <span data-start="848.1" data-end="850.709">it to ask for help from you guys and</span> <span data-start="850.709" data-end="852.6">it's kind of a new take on documentation</span> <span data-start="852.6" data-end="855.36">you kind of our idea is if you want to</span> <span data-start="855.36" data-end="856.619">have really great documentation for 10</span> <span data-start="856.619" data-end="858.66">we want a building system that allows us</span> <span data-start="858.66" data-end="862.499">to quickly build up documentation um in</span> <span data-start="862.499" data-end="863.91">there and we've tried to address all the</span> <span data-start="863.91" data-end="865.379">different problems and the first one was</span> <span data-start="865.379" data-end="868.529">the parser problem right every time you</span> <span data-start="868.529" data-end="869.999">start your documentation tool kind of</span> <span data-start="869.999" data-end="872.1">step one is you know a not so fun</span> <span data-start="872.1" data-end="874.169">programming task of building a parser</span> <span data-start="874.169" data-end="877.139">and what some people have done is create</span> <span data-start="877.139" data-end="878.73">like little pseudo languages or whatever</span> <span data-start="878.73" data-end="881.189">to create easier parsers that are you</span> <span data-start="881.189" data-end="884.669">know mainly for documentation but again</span> <span data-start="884.669" data-end="886.169">you have to learn how to use this etc</span> <span data-start="886.169" data-end="889.319">etc so we are really really good I</span> <span data-start="889.319" data-end="890.79">piggybacking off of other people's</span> <span data-start="890.79" data-end="894.089">success I think it's one of our best</span> <span data-start="894.089" data-end="896.509">qualities and so what we've done is Oh</span> <span data-start="896.509" data-end="898.47">first let me say this is the guy was</span> <span data-start="898.47" data-end="901.11">actually making this is our intern what</span> <span data-start="901.11" data-end="902.189">he looks like in case you're a visual</span> <span data-start="902.189" data-end="905.519">learner that's as a Twitter he's</span> <span data-start="905.519" data-end="907.169">actually doing all the work I just sat</span> <span data-start="907.169" data-end="909.029">down and pontificated over the phone to</span> <span data-start="909.029" data-end="910.68">him and you know he said okay I'll</span> <span data-start="910.68" data-end="913.83">mented but anyways what we're doing is</span> <span data-start="913.83" data-end="916.529">using existing technologies and textmate</span> <span data-start="916.529" data-end="919.08">already has a huge storage of language</span> <span data-start="919.08" data-end="922.14">definitions so basically what Socratic</span> <span data-start="922.14" data-end="923.97">is capable of doing is if you already</span> <span data-start="923.97" data-end="925.56">have a text mate bundle for your</span> <span data-start="925.56" data-end="928.92">language socratic knows how to parse and</span> <span data-start="928.92" data-end="931.35">create documentation for it and if</span> <span data-start="931.35" data-end="932.73">you're brand new language and you don't</span> <span data-start="932.73" data-end="934.02">have a text may bundle well at least</span> <span data-start="934.02" data-end="935.279">it's two birds with one stone right</span> <span data-start="935.279" data-end="937.17">because not only are you creating the</span> <span data-start="937.17" data-end="938.73">documentation parser but you're also</span> <span data-start="938.73" data-end="940.35">getting you know the plug-in for the</span> <span data-start="940.35" data-end="943.62">most used text editor for free and so if</span> <span data-start="943.62" data-end="944.58">you're not familiar with the way</span> <span data-start="944.58" data-end="947.82">textmate handles source code it's really</span> <span data-start="947.82" data-end="950.19">quite cool I personally think that text</span> <span data-start="950.19" data-end="951.66">made is one of the ugliest programs ever</span> <span data-start="951.66" data-end="952.649">created that's why I don't use it</span> <span data-start="952.649" data-end="954.839">however internally it is quite beautiful</span> <span data-start="954.839" data-end="957.12">and this is what it does it actually</span> <span data-start="957.12" data-end="959.55">creates these things called scopes so</span> <span data-start="959.55" data-end="961.38">basically you know right here that's</span> <span data-start="961.38" data-end="965.01">some objective J code that's the class</span> <span data-start="965.01" data-end="966.63">name and as you can see it knows it's in</span> <span data-start="966.63" data-end="969.089">the objective J source and it knows it's</span> <span data-start="969.089" data-end="971.79">within a class implementation so as it's</span> <span data-start="971.79" data-end="974.04">parsing it kind of creates like a tree</span> <span data-start="974.04" data-end="976.529">of your source code like live right and</span> <span data-start="976.529" data-end="978.6">so here I have a method with in table</span> <span data-start="978.6" data-end="980.43">view and as you can see once again it</span> <span data-start="980.43" data-end="982.35">knows working the source code that</span> <span data-start="982.35" data-end="984.839">subjective J which is no kind of like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="984.839" data-end="987">JavaScript it knows that if we're in a</span> <span data-start="987" data-end="989.04">you know implementation of a class and</span> <span data-start="989.04" data-end="991.89">love a blind it even knows that where my</span> <span data-start="991.89" data-end="993.3">cursor was right here when I was doing</span> <span data-start="993.3" data-end="995.1">this it even knows that I'm in the</span> <span data-start="995.1" data-end="996.93">argument types and what kind of type it</span> <span data-start="996.93" data-end="999.6">is so textmate is incredibly smart it</span> <span data-start="999.6" data-end="1000.98">knows exactly what's going on in all</span> <span data-start="1000.98" data-end="1004.01">your source code and there's already a</span> <span data-start="1004.01" data-end="1005.959">librarian Ruby called text cow which</span> <span data-start="1005.959" data-end="1007.459">uses this information to syntax</span> <span data-start="1007.459" data-end="1008.69">highlight and you should check it out</span> <span data-start="1008.69" data-end="1010.61">it's very cool and we took this idea a</span> <span data-start="1010.61" data-end="1011.75">little bit further and what we actually</span> <span data-start="1011.75" data-end="1013.52">do when you run socratic on your source</span> <span data-start="1013.52" data-end="1016.579">code is we build up the Dom of your</span> <span data-start="1016.579" data-end="1018.32">source this is kind of how you can</span> <span data-start="1018.32" data-end="1019.82">imagine it being that that's that little</span> <span data-start="1019.82" data-end="1022.49">snippet if you're familiar with HTML</span> <span data-start="1022.49" data-end="1026.27">then this should be very familiar to you</span> <span data-start="1026.27" data-end="1028.49">we're basically taking all those corpse</span> <span data-start="1028.49" data-end="1030.65">and scopes and building the tag soup out</span> <span data-start="1030.65" data-end="1032.54">of them and the really cool thing about</span> <span data-start="1032.54" data-end="1035.089">that is that that allows us to create</span> <span data-start="1035.089" data-end="1037.61">queries right so all of a sudden you</span> <span data-start="1037.61" data-end="1040.309">don't have to write parsers for your</span> <span data-start="1040.309" data-end="1042.689">language or your DSL or you know</span> <span data-start="1042.689" data-end="1044.519">your framework anymore you can just do</span> <span data-start="1044.519" data-end="1046.199">queries and this is a very very powerful</span> <span data-start="1046.199" data-end="1048.179">thing so this is just like an example if</span> <span data-start="1048.179" data-end="1050.429">you imagine docks at Kempton org slash</span> <span data-start="1050.429" data-end="1053.34">classes / CP table column you do</span> <span data-start="1053.34" data-end="1054.99">something just like jQuery where you say</span> <span data-start="1054.99" data-end="1056.85">well give me all the implementations</span> <span data-start="1056.85" data-end="1059.159">where the name of the class is CP table</span> <span data-start="1059.159" data-end="1061.86">column you can do many more powerful</span> <span data-start="1061.86" data-end="1064.32">things too like and cappuccino there is</span> <span data-start="1064.32" data-end="1066.12">a convention that all methods that start</span> <span data-start="1066.12" data-end="1067.889">with an underscore our private so you</span> <span data-start="1067.889" data-end="1069.389">could actually say give me all the</span> <span data-start="1069.389" data-end="1071.46">methods in the class ap table column</span> <span data-start="1071.46" data-end="1073.11">which do not start with an underscore</span> <span data-start="1073.11" data-end="1074.429">and that's really easy to do with this</span> <span data-start="1074.429" data-end="1076.289">query language so when you build your</span> <span data-start="1076.289" data-end="1078.12">templates it's really really easy to do</span> <span data-start="1078.12" data-end="1080.46">things like will give me all the strings</span> <span data-start="1080.46" data-end="1082.649">within the function class talk create</span> <span data-start="1082.649" data-end="1083.97">and i'm going to say those are my</span> <span data-start="1083.97" data-end="1086.49">classes so it's really a powerful</span> <span data-start="1086.49" data-end="1090.72">templating language the second thing is</span> <span data-start="1090.72" data-end="1092.46">i think pretty obvious from what i was</span> <span data-start="1092.46" data-end="1093.6">talking about earlier if you're not</span> <span data-start="1093.6" data-end="1095.399">putting your documentation in the source</span> <span data-start="1095.399" data-end="1097.71">code then it's a wiki and it's a media</span> <span data-start="1097.71" data-end="1099.24">wiki so people can put movies and</span> <span data-start="1099.24" data-end="1101.909">whatever they want the other interesting</span> <span data-start="1101.909" data-end="1104.399">part is that it's a wiki based on get</span> <span data-start="1104.399" data-end="1105.899">this is actually one of the places where</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1105.899" data-end="1108.6">I'm very curious if people have other</span> <span data-start="1108.6" data-end="1112.5">ideas the idea here is that we're trying</span> <span data-start="1112.5" data-end="1115.259">to make it really easy to keep your</span> <span data-start="1115.259" data-end="1116.879">documentation up to date with your</span> <span data-start="1116.879" data-end="1118.83">source code so what commonly happens is</span> <span data-start="1118.83" data-end="1120">you have a lot of people running off</span> <span data-start="1120" data-end="1122.07">trunk but your source code represents</span> <span data-start="1122.07" data-end="1123.99">the stable branch and no one wants to</span> <span data-start="1123.99" data-end="1125.73">update the stable branch like source</span> <span data-start="1125.73" data-end="1128.129">code that's public because well then you</span> <span data-start="1128.129" data-end="1129.24">know would represent stuff that's not</span> <span data-start="1129.24" data-end="1132.179">shipping so what we actually do is since</span> <span data-start="1132.179" data-end="1134.759">it's a good base wiki it matches the</span> <span data-start="1134.759" data-end="1137.82">branches of your source code so if you</span> <span data-start="1137.82" data-end="1141.659">tag a release a 0.6 or whatever when</span> <span data-start="1141.659" data-end="1142.86">people hate your source code they can</span> <span data-start="1142.86" data-end="1144.12">actually say well show me the</span> <span data-start="1144.12" data-end="1146.279">documentation as it was during 0.6 or</span> <span data-start="1146.279" data-end="1148.169">show me what the documentation for this</span> <span data-start="1148.169" data-end="1150.21">new feature branches or show me blah</span> <span data-start="1150.21" data-end="1151.98">blah blah so it matches all the branches</span> <span data-start="1151.98" data-end="1155.7">and creates a pretty powerful way of you</span> <span data-start="1155.7" data-end="1157.2">know managing the different</span> <span data-start="1157.2" data-end="1158.49">documentation few different versions of</span> <span data-start="1158.49" data-end="1163.649">your source code secondly we built in</span> <span data-start="1163.649" data-end="1165.539">support for date of issues so at some</span> <span data-start="1165.539" data-end="1167.34">point we're going to you know make it</span> <span data-start="1167.34" data-end="1168.779">generic and let you do whatever right</span> <span data-start="1168.779" data-end="1169.86">now we're just trying to ship something</span> <span data-start="1169.86" data-end="1173.61">so this tries to solve that original</span> <span data-start="1173.61" data-end="1175.529">problem of they go to your documentation</span> <span data-start="1175.529" data-end="1176.05">it's</span> <span data-start="1176.05" data-end="1178.6">have to go somewhere else etc what we're</span> <span data-start="1178.6" data-end="1179.68">trying to do is you hit the</span> <span data-start="1179.68" data-end="1182.56">documentation and you see the</span> <span data-start="1182.56" data-end="1184.66">description of the method and right</span> <span data-start="1184.66" data-end="1186.19">under it you see all the bugs following</span> <span data-start="1186.19" data-end="1187.66">that method right so if you know the</span> <span data-start="1187.66" data-end="1189.07">method says you know should return six</span> <span data-start="1189.07" data-end="1190.36">and there's a bug filed on it that says</span> <span data-start="1190.36" data-end="1191.8">returns five you know immediately</span> <span data-start="1191.8" data-end="1193.36">there's a problem you don't need to go</span> <span data-start="1193.36" data-end="1196">try it think that maybe it's your fault</span> <span data-start="1196" data-end="1198.66">end up in the IRC room or whatever and</span> <span data-start="1198.66" data-end="1201.28">the next step to this is we would also</span> <span data-start="1201.28" data-end="1203.26">really like to include the tests right</span> <span data-start="1203.26" data-end="1204.4">next to it so I think would be cool if</span> <span data-start="1204.4" data-end="1205.57">you know you have the method description</span> <span data-start="1205.57" data-end="1208.06">here are all the bugs and hear all the</span> <span data-start="1208.06" data-end="1209.23">tests so if you see that a test is</span> <span data-start="1209.23" data-end="1210.67">failing it's almost like an automatic</span> <span data-start="1210.67" data-end="1212.74">bug right so we haven't worked on that</span> <span data-start="1212.74" data-end="1214.24">part at all yet but the github issues</span> <span data-start="1214.24" data-end="1218.26">thing is working pretty well so yeah so</span> <span data-start="1218.26" data-end="1220.09">so kind of the sum of what socratic is</span> <span data-start="1220.09" data-end="1222.88">doing it's it's using text me bundles to</span> <span data-start="1222.88" data-end="1224.95">automatically generate a wiki for your</span> <span data-start="1224.95" data-end="1227.44">documentation you know that sits on</span> <span data-start="1227.44"

type</span> <span data-start="1240.37" data-end="1242.29">socratic and then you get URL and you</span> <span data-start="1242.29" data-end="1243.88">have a server that's running that's your</span> <span data-start="1243.88" data-end="1245.65">your documentation so it should be a</span> <span data-start="1245.65" data-end="1247.48">really really easy in the day you took</span> <span data-start="1247.48" data-end="1249.7">your code to have really great</span> <span data-start="1249.7" data-end="1252.73">documentation for it and of course it's</span> <span data-start="1252.73" data-end="1254.38">built entirely on top of common Jas and</span> <span data-start="1254.38" data-end="1255.97">this is important for two reasons one</span> <span data-start="1255.97" data-end="1258.22">because I think we really need this</span> <span data-start="1258.22" data-end="1260.47">right now because you know again we're</span> <span data-start="1260.47" data-end="1262.09">kind of a new community for building</span> <span data-start="1262.09" data-end="1264.58">lots of new stuff we can really document</span> <span data-start="1264.58" data-end="1266.17">it well and the other thing is I think</span> <span data-start="1266.17" data-end="1267.79">this could be a really powerful coup for</span> <span data-start="1267.79" data-end="1271.18">us because documentation again I believe</span> <span data-start="1271.18" data-end="1273.4">to be like a space that's not really</span> <span data-start="1273.4" data-end="1275.92">paid attention to a lot and I think if</span> <span data-start="1275.92" data-end="1277.84">we create like the gold standard of a</span> <span data-start="1277.84" data-end="1279.94">documentation tool we can get a lot of</span> <span data-start="1279.94" data-end="1281.38">people to be running how much Jes</span> <span data-start="1281.38" data-end="1283.93">servers serving this step up and you</span> <span data-start="1283.93" data-end="1285.37">know that will introduce them to kind of</span> <span data-start="1285.37" data-end="1287.77">you know JavaScript on the server etc so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1287.77" data-end="1290.44">I'm pretty excited about that um so what</span> <span data-start="1290.44" data-end="1291.46">I'm going to show you now is not the</span> <span data-start="1291.46" data-end="1293.29">actual documentation tool it's not done</span> <span data-start="1293.29" data-end="1294.76">i'm going to show you kind of the tool</span> <span data-start="1294.76" data-end="1297.04">that we use to analyze what's going on</span> <span data-start="1297.04" data-end="1298.54">in the background</span> <span data-start="1298.54" data-end="1303.57">you'll understand the second so this is</span> <span data-start="1303.57" data-end="1306.16">here I'll show you what happens right</span> <span data-start="1306.16" data-end="1308.26">now so again when you load this up the</span> <span data-start="1308.26" data-end="1316.57">first time so again the idea is that you</span> <span data-start="1316.57" data-end="1318.55">would not do this in a you I you know</span> <span data-start="1318.55" data-end="1320.23">you running off your server but again</span> <span data-start="1320.23" data-end="1322.89">it's set up right now to automatically</span> <span data-start="1322.89" data-end="1326.14">piggyback off of any existing repo so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1326.14" data-end="1327.34">I've already have the one set up for</span> <span data-start="1327.34" data-end="1329.89">cappuccino and the way the the queries</span> <span data-start="1329.89" data-end="1331.21">are working right now is that they are</span> <span data-start="1331.21" data-end="1333.49">file based but again you could turn this</span> <span data-start="1333.49" data-end="1335.77">around so right now again all it does is</span> <span data-start="1335.77" data-end="1337.75">this is this is being automatically</span> <span data-start="1337.75" data-end="1340.21">generated from our queries so there's no</span> <span data-start="1340.21" data-end="1342.79">there's no fancy parsing taking taking</span> <span data-start="1342.79" data-end="1344.23">place we're just saying you know give me</span> <span data-start="1344.23" data-end="1345.76">everything that looks like a method</span> <span data-start="1345.76" data-end="1346.87">within everything that looks like a</span> <span data-start="1346.87" data-end="1350.92">class etc so your dough if you look at</span> <span data-start="1350.92" data-end="1352.9">individual methods and again we have the</span> <span data-start="1352.9" data-end="1355.09">capability of here are all the bugs and</span> <span data-start="1355.09" data-end="1357.52">you can link the bug to the issue and</span> <span data-start="1357.52" data-end="1359.95">now those in the system are you know</span> <span data-start="1359.95" data-end="1362.62">considered tied together or whatever so</span> <span data-start="1362.62" data-end="1363.64">again this is kind of the tool we've</span> <span data-start="1363.64" data-end="1364.87">been using to test out these</span> <span data-start="1364.87" data-end="1366.67">technologies this is not the way we</span> <span data-start="1366.67" data-end="1367.9">think the documentation will look</span> <span data-start="1367.9" data-end="1371.05">obviously so yeah we're really excited</span> <span data-start="1371.05" data-end="1372.79">about this project again we'd like it to</span> <span data-start="1372.79" data-end="1374.95">be ready for one point o before then so</span> <span data-start="1374.95" data-end="1376.3">we can actually have dr. really good</span> <span data-start="1376.3" data-end="1379">documentation we really interested in</span> <span data-start="1379" data-end="1380.8">your guys's ideas ultimately we want</span> <span data-start="1380.8" data-end="1382.24">this to be you know a really great</span> <span data-start="1382.24" data-end="1384.58">documentation tool for everyone if you</span> <span data-start="1384.58" data-end="1386.2">have any ideas kind of like the things</span> <span data-start="1386.2" data-end="1387.01">that have always bugged you about</span> <span data-start="1387.01" data-end="1388.99">documentation feel free to talk to us if</span> <span data-start="1388.99" data-end="1390.37">you want to start writing code for this</span> <span data-start="1390.37" data-end="1393.28">feel free to talk to us there really</span> <span data-start="1393.28" data-end="1395.83">isn't a one repo for this yet because</span> <span data-start="1395.83" data-end="1397.42">again our interns partially working on</span> <span data-start="1397.42" data-end="1398.98">it and we are when the coming weeks</span> <span data-start="1398.98" data-end="1401.08">we'll release kind of one place where</span> <span data-start="1401.08" data-end="1404.56">all this stuff is together yeah so that</span> <span data-start="1404.56" data-end="1411.81">is Socratic defense or presentation</span> <span data-start="1411.82" data-end="1414.44">alright so that was again saccadic and</span> <span data-start="1414.44" data-end="1416.749">now I want to talk about cappuccino just</span> <span data-start="1416.749" data-end="1419.709">for a little bit about our new release</span> <span data-start="1419.709" data-end="1421.94">the coolest part about the new release</span> <span data-start="1421.94" data-end="1424.249">is that and it is built entirely on top</span> <span data-start="1424.249" data-end="1426.169">of common Jas which means if you're</span> <span data-start="1426.169" data-end="1427.669">already running Narwhal or any other</span> <span data-start="1427.669" data-end="1430.7">common gas distribution you can now</span> <span data-start="1430.7" data-end="1432.799">install cappuccino with the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1432.799" data-end="1434.57">you know package manager notice tusk</span> <span data-start="1434.57" data-end="1436.459">tusk and sell cappuccino and you will</span> <span data-start="1436.459" data-end="1438.739">have it the other cool thing is that our</span> <span data-start="1438.739" data-end="1441.229">entire system is on top of GX which</span> <span data-start="1441.229" data-end="1442.909">means we don't build with Ruby anymore</span> <span data-start="1442.909" data-end="1444.95">we don't require you know our users to</span> <span data-start="1444.95" data-end="1446.869">you know install some crazy jam or</span> <span data-start="1446.869" data-end="1449.059">anything you know we use build tools</span> <span data-start="1449.059" data-end="1450.289">that are built with JavaScript we know</span> <span data-start="1450.289" data-end="1452.45">who's you know JavaScript across the</span> <span data-start="1452.45" data-end="1454.729">board all the tools we provide the</span> <span data-start="1454.729" data-end="1455.959">custom ones are built in public comes</span> <span data-start="1455.959" data-end="1457.759">yes so I'm really excited about this</span> <span data-start="1457.759" data-end="1459.139">this was actually one of our main</span> <span data-start="1459.139" data-end="1461.119">complaints I really don't understand why</span> <span data-start="1461.119" data-end="1463.459">like Ruby comes installed on Mac OS 10 I</span> <span data-start="1463.459" data-end="1465.499">never understood why people find this to</span> <span data-start="1465.499" data-end="1468.32">be hard but whatever you know the users</span> <span data-start="1468.32" data-end="1469.909">wanted they don't need to know Ruby</span> <span data-start="1469.909" data-end="1473.059">anymore the one I think valid complaint</span> <span data-start="1473.059" data-end="1474.739">was that if people wanted to fix bugs in</span> <span data-start="1474.739" data-end="1476.479">our build tools or whatever if they</span> <span data-start="1476.479" data-end="1477.95">didn't know Ruby then yeah of course it</span> <span data-start="1477.95" data-end="1479.45">was going to be hard for them so now</span> <span data-start="1479.45" data-end="1480.95">that's not an issue anymore it's one</span> <span data-start="1480.95" data-end="1483.559">language across the entire system we I</span> <span data-start="1483.559" data-end="1484.879">think are now at a point where we can</span> <span data-start="1484.879" data-end="1486.379">have parity with other languages like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1486.379" data-end="1488.989">Python and Ruby or that's the case so</span> <span data-start="1488.989" data-end="1492.079">it's pretty exciting the other really</span> <span data-start="1492.079" data-end="1495.44">cool addition is CP table view this is</span> <span data-start="1495.44" data-end="1497.419">one of the classes that was most</span> <span data-start="1497.419" data-end="1498.859">obviously missing when we shipped Kevin</span> <span data-start="1498.859" data-end="1500.269">G no it's one of the most used classes</span> <span data-start="1500.269" data-end="1502.369">in cocoa it's really really important on</span> <span data-start="1502.369" data-end="1507.049">the web and on the desktop and this was</span> <span data-start="1507.049" data-end="1509.719">created entirely by outside contributors</span> <span data-start="1509.719" data-end="1512.359">which is pretty exciting to us mainly</span> <span data-start="1512.359" data-end="1513.499">because that means I don't have to know</span> <span data-start="1513.499" data-end="1516.079">at all how it works and that's always</span> <span data-start="1516.079" data-end="1519.2">good and it's very performant that's</span> <span data-start="1519.2" data-end="1522.139">very beautiful and I not only think that</span> <span data-start="1522.139" data-end="1524.299">we have like all the coolest-looking and</span> <span data-start="1524.299" data-end="1525.859">performing table views but it's also one</span> <span data-start="1525.859" data-end="1527.959">of the easiest to make because we</span> <span data-start="1527.959" data-end="1530.149">shipped 08 with nib to sip support for</span> <span data-start="1530.149" data-end="1531.169">table view modes like to show you that</span> <span data-start="1531.169" data-end="1535.279">now so if you're not familiar with a</span> <span data-start="1535.279" data-end="1539.089">cappuccino we have kind of two main ways</span> <span data-start="1539.089" data-end="1541.849">that people make kind of you is for a</span> <span data-start="1541.849" data-end="1542.33">framework</span> <span data-start="1542.33" data-end="1544.34">one is with our tool called atlas and</span> <span data-start="1544.34" data-end="1546.47">the other one is using Apple's existing</span> <span data-start="1546.47" data-end="1548.12">interface builder tool which were</span> <span data-start="1548.12" data-end="1549.98">capable of converting into web</span> <span data-start="1549.98" data-end="1553.97">interfaces and ever since we released</span> <span data-start="1553.97" data-end="1556.039">new to civ this is kind of the main way</span> <span data-start="1556.039" data-end="1557.51">that people make you eyes with kevin t</span> <span data-start="1557.51" data-end="1559.34">know now because i think it's way easier</span> <span data-start="1559.34" data-end="1561.47">so i'll go ahead and show you how you</span> <span data-start="1561.47" data-end="1565.85">make a table view in epigenome so here's</span> <span data-start="1565.85" data-end="1569.149">this this zip file which if you've ever</span> <span data-start="1569.149" data-end="1570.86">done anything on mac OS 10 this is kind</span> <span data-start="1570.86" data-end="1578.63">of how you make interfaces in OS 10 so</span> <span data-start="1578.63" data-end="1580.22">this is kind of like the main window of</span> <span data-start="1580.22" data-end="1582.679">my application and if i want a table</span> <span data-start="1582.679" data-end="1592.98">view I just bring it up here</span> <span data-start="1592.99" data-end="1597.01">and you know we can add columns and give</span> <span data-start="1597.01" data-end="1598.929">it alternating road colors and that sort</span> <span data-start="1598.929" data-end="1612.45">of thing</span> <span data-start="1612.46" data-end="1615.08">so that's kind of all it takes to</span> <span data-start="1615.08" data-end="1617.27">actually make the table view and then to</span> <span data-start="1617.27" data-end="1618.77">get the data you just need to give it a</span> <span data-start="1618.77" data-end="1620.51">data source so we use this technology</span> <span data-start="1620.51" data-end="1625.82">called connections so I just connect the</span> <span data-start="1625.82" data-end="1627.29">table view to my app controller which</span> <span data-start="1627.29" data-end="1628.88">will be providing the data for the table</span> <span data-start="1628.88" data-end="1647.76">view and then I save it and</span> <span data-start="1647.77" data-end="1666.67">we go that will convert the file</span> <span data-start="1666.68" data-end="1668.27">so this is the table view we just</span> <span data-start="1668.27" data-end="1670.22">created and it's got 5 million rows and</span> <span data-start="1670.22" data-end="1672.26">as you can see was pretty darn good of</span> <span data-start="1672.26" data-end="1673.46">course we're just providing dummy data</span> <span data-start="1673.46" data-end="1678.44">but still pretty impressive for went</span> <span data-start="1678.44" data-end="1680.72">away they're just so that's how you make</span> <span data-start="1680.72" data-end="1683.12">table views in cavaquinho really heavy</span> <span data-start="1683.12" data-end="1685.37">with this feature I'd like to try some</span> <span data-start="1685.37" data-end="1687.5">more features from table view but I'm</span> <span data-start="1687.5" data-end="1688.67">going to take the chance to kind of show</span> <span data-start="1688.67" data-end="1693.05">you two features together so something</span> <span data-start="1693.05" data-end="1696.14">we released recently with 08 is this new</span> <span data-start="1696.14" data-end="1700.52">cap record tool and basically what this</span> <span data-start="1700.52" data-end="1703.97">lets you do is record interactions and</span> <span data-start="1703.97" data-end="1705.5">basically the idea is you know your</span> <span data-start="1705.5" data-end="1706.79">users can kind of record what they're</span> <span data-start="1706.79" data-end="1708.47">doing if they have a bug that can send</span> <span data-start="1708.47" data-end="1709.64">it to you and then you can see what's</span> <span data-start="1709.64" data-end="1712.22">going on so I'll go ahead and hit record</span> <span data-start="1712.22" data-end="1719.66">here I'll reload the app so these are</span> <span data-start="1719.66" data-end="1720.92">kind of the different kind of table view</span> <span data-start="1720.92" data-end="1725.12">styles which is like a list style you</span> <span data-start="1725.12" data-end="1732.2">can sort these rows I guess you can sort</span> <span data-start="1732.2" data-end="1736.67">the Rose I'm sorry very good so you can</span> <span data-start="1736.67" data-end="1737.57">drag and drop and we've got like</span> <span data-start="1737.57" data-end="1739.01">different kind of drag and drop and</span> <span data-start="1739.01" data-end="1746.96">stuff and if i get stopped one this will</span> <span data-start="1746.96" data-end="1749.15">actually save it on the server and then</span> <span data-start="1749.15" data-end="1760.039">you know wherever the servers running</span> <span data-start="1760.049" data-end="1793.43">so some apps</span> <span data-start="1793.44" data-end="1796.409">so</span> <span data-start="1796.419" data-end="1798.429">we go to actually we play again</span> <span data-start="1798.429" data-end="1801.549">everything we just did as again really</span> <span data-start="1801.549" data-end="1802.989">cool because people can send you you</span> <span data-start="1802.989" data-end="1804.22">know where they're experiencing bugs and</span> <span data-start="1804.22" data-end="1807.7">stuff and then you can profile on your</span> <span data-start="1807.7" data-end="1809.619">machine or you know do the whatever</span> <span data-start="1809.619" data-end="1811.509">debugging you want and what we actually</span> <span data-start="1811.509" data-end="1813.159">found which we didn't expect was that</span> <span data-start="1813.159" data-end="1815.559">this tool was actually really useful for</span> <span data-start="1815.559" data-end="1819.58">this device over here the iPad because</span> <span data-start="1819.58" data-end="1822.429">as is generally the case with the web we</span> <span data-start="1822.429" data-end="1824.559">take one step forward in like a thousand</span> <span data-start="1824.559" data-end="1827.889">map so the ipad is really great web wise</span> <span data-start="1827.889" data-end="1829.539">because you know it's it only runs web</span> <span data-start="1829.539" data-end="1831.009">kids we can you know rely on all these</span> <span data-start="1831.009" data-end="1832.539">fancy features which were usually afraid</span> <span data-start="1832.539" data-end="1834.759">to use or whatever but it's really bad</span> <span data-start="1834.759" data-end="1836.679">because it's kind of jettisoned us back</span> <span data-start="1836.679" data-end="1838.659">to 2000 where we didn't have any sort of</span> <span data-start="1838.659" data-end="1841.48">tools at all there is basically no way</span> <span data-start="1841.48" data-end="1843.549">to debug any sort of web stuff on this</span> <span data-start="1843.549" data-end="1846.69">device there's a little debug console</span> <span data-start="1846.69" data-end="1851.559">built into Safari it sucks I can say</span> <span data-start="1851.559" data-end="1853.419">that because I wrote it and it's</span> <span data-start="1853.419" data-end="1855.999">terrible like it basically tells you the</span> <span data-start="1855.999" data-end="1857.559">errors you're having but it cuts off the</span> <span data-start="1857.559" data-end="1861.34">strings so your goodness you're running</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1861.34" data-end="1863.259">I can see an error it doesn't fit so</span> <span data-start="1863.259" data-end="1864.759">your best option is to turn it sideways</span> <span data-start="1864.759" data-end="1866.289">and then you can see a little bit more</span> <span data-start="1866.289" data-end="1867.279">of the error because you have a little</span> <span data-start="1867.279" data-end="1870.1">bit more room so that's that's a basic</span> <span data-start="1870.1" data-end="1872.44">that's basically the extent of debugging</span> <span data-start="1872.44" data-end="1875.379">on the iPad so what we've done and I'm</span> <span data-start="1875.379" data-end="1878.98">just going to load this up here okay so</span> <span data-start="1878.98" data-end="1880.749">i guess the other question is well why</span> <span data-start="1880.749" data-end="1882.009">can't i just a bug in safari they're</span> <span data-start="1882.009" data-end="1883.869">both WebKit right well that is true for</span> <span data-start="1883.869" data-end="1885.94">the most part but if you have bugs that</span> <span data-start="1885.94" data-end="1887.889">happen due to like touch events and</span> <span data-start="1887.889" data-end="1890.47">stuff you can't because you know Safari</span> <span data-start="1890.47" data-end="1891.97">does it have touch events on this</span> <span data-start="1891.97" data-end="1893.859">machine and you can take the time to</span> <span data-start="1893.859" data-end="1895.059">like manually recreate the events</span> <span data-start="1895.059" data-end="1897.669">yourself but that's a real pain so this</span> <span data-start="1897.669" data-end="1898.72">tool is really great because you can</span> <span data-start="1898.72" data-end="1903.039">actually let me so take a second to load</span> <span data-start="1903.039" data-end="1905.559">here you can actually do whatever</span> <span data-start="1905.559" data-end="1907.629">interactions you want on the iPad let it</span> <span data-start="1907.629" data-end="1910.749">crash and then you can run it back here</span> <span data-start="1910.749" data-end="1913.419">and then profile it or you know catch</span> <span data-start="1913.419" data-end="1915.399">the errors or break on the air and see</span> <span data-start="1915.399" data-end="1917.049">exactly what's going on because you know</span> <span data-start="1917.049" data-end="1918.22">we can translate all the events and</span> <span data-start="1918.22" data-end="1925.7">everything so I me do some stuff here</span> <span data-start="1925.71" data-end="1928.15">again I'm sorry that I'm not showing you</span> <span data-start="1928.15" data-end="1931.84">this live we wanted to hook it up but as</span> <span data-start="1931.84" data-end="1934.87">it turns out this thing does not export</span> <span data-start="1934.87" data-end="1937.03">video by default like your app has to</span> <span data-start="1937.03" data-end="1938.83">support that feature and we thought it</span> <span data-start="1938.83" data-end="1940.539">was silly to write a native app to wrap</span> <span data-start="1940.539" data-end="1942.34">the WebKit to show how cool web apps are</span> <span data-start="1942.34" data-end="1949.45">on the iPad so hopefully I can now show</span> <span data-start="1949.45" data-end="1965.9">you this here</span> <span data-start="1965.91" data-end="1968.26">so take a second load up Cyrus our</span> <span data-start="1968.26" data-end="1972.61">servers pretty slow</span> <span data-start="1972.62" data-end="1986">when I just made</span> <span data-start="1986.01" data-end="1988.47">here you go so as you can see that's me</span> <span data-start="1988.47" data-end="1989.94">doing all the touch events and stuff and</span> <span data-start="1989.94" data-end="1991.86">you know getting all the wonderful CSS</span> <span data-start="1991.86" data-end="1995.4">redraw errors as you can see so this</span> <span data-start="1995.4" data-end="1996.72">allows you to go in there to bug see</span> <span data-start="1996.72" data-end="1999.63">what's going on yeah so I think that's</span> <span data-start="1999.63" data-end="2001.58">pretty cool we've been using this tool</span> <span data-start="2001.58" data-end="2004.22">to write a kind of an iPad app that we</span> <span data-start="2004.22" data-end="2005.48">are going to open source soon it's</span> <span data-start="2005.48" data-end="2007.49">called scrapbook I'll show you that very</span> <span data-start="2007.49" data-end="2011.21">briefly this is this this we're going to</span> <span data-start="2011.21" data-end="2012.74">open sources completely and we're also</span> <span data-start="2012.74" data-end="2015.05">going to release it and basically lets</span> <span data-start="2015.05" data-end="2019.93">you create scrapbooks um so come here</span> <span data-start="2019.93" data-end="2024.26">you know you can choose a template this</span> <span data-start="2024.26" data-end="2025.82">is pretty cool it actually grabs the</span> <span data-start="2025.82" data-end="2027.2">images straight from your facebook</span> <span data-start="2027.2" data-end="2031.16">account this is using a new plug-in for</span> <span data-start="2031.16" data-end="2032.72">cappuccino called Facebook kit that we</span> <span data-start="2032.72" data-end="2035.15">released recently so as you can see</span> <span data-start="2035.15" data-end="2036.44">you've got like different templates and</span> <span data-start="2036.44" data-end="2040.16">stuff and you know you can you have the</span> <span data-start="2040.16" data-end="2043.04">images and drag them in and do touchy</span> <span data-start="2043.04" data-end="2049.97">kind of things so yeah so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="2049.97" data-end="2051.139">cool again we're going to be open</span> <span data-start="2051.139" data-end="2052.879">sourcing this the other cool thing is</span> <span data-start="2052.879" data-end="2053.899">we're going to be releasing this and</span> <span data-start="2053.899" data-end="2055.34">we're going to have a print button so</span> <span data-start="2055.34" data-end="2056.99">will actually send you your scrapbook</span> <span data-start="2056.99" data-end="2060.679">printed out in paper so you can show it</span> <span data-start="2060.679" data-end="2061.94">to your grandma who does not have any</span> <span data-start="2061.94" data-end="2064.7">ipad or apparently those are built for</span> <span data-start="2064.7" data-end="2069.05">her so maybe it'll be for you so one of</span> <span data-start="2069.05" data-end="2070.73">the cool things about the way we built</span> <span data-start="2070.73" data-end="2073.639">this app is that we used atlas to do it</span> <span data-start="2073.639" data-end="2075.409">so Atlas is this other tool was talking</span> <span data-start="2075.409" data-end="2076.73">about like we have nib to save which is</span> <span data-start="2076.73" data-end="2077.99">completely open source so you don't have</span> <span data-start="2077.99" data-end="2079.31">to pay us or anything to use it and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="2079.31" data-end="2081.649">Atlas is kind of our version of this</span> <span data-start="2081.649" data-end="2084.11">Apple tool and the really cool thing</span> <span data-start="2084.11" data-end="2086.84">about it is we recently added this</span> <span data-start="2086.84" data-end="2088.04">plugins feature where you can write your</span> <span data-start="2088.04" data-end="2092.149">own custom UI plugins for Atlas so if I</span> <span data-start="2092.149" data-end="2097.6">open this out this is the project and</span> <span data-start="2097.6" data-end="2100.1">what we did was write a plug-in for kind</span> <span data-start="2100.1" data-end="2102.26">of our scrapbook pages so we're actually</span> <span data-start="2102.26" data-end="2105.77">able to give our designer just Atlas and</span> <span data-start="2105.77" data-end="2107.84">this plug-in and he doesn't need to send</span> <span data-start="2107.84" data-end="2109.25">us Photoshop files that we need to cut</span> <span data-start="2109.25" data-end="2110.36">up or anything he can actually just</span> <span data-start="2110.36" data-end="2113.45">build these templates himself so show</span> <span data-start="2113.45" data-end="2116.48">you that</span> <span data-start="2116.49" data-end="2119.32">so it's all the little template pages</span> <span data-start="2119.32" data-end="2121.48">you saw running on the iPad there are</span> <span data-start="2121.48" data-end="2123.25">actually created right here so this is</span> <span data-start="2123.25" data-end="2126.58">how we lays them out and again doesn't</span> <span data-start="2126.58" data-end="2127.93">need to know any code or anything and</span> <span data-start="2127.93" data-end="2129.58">you know these things have their own</span> <span data-start="2129.58" data-end="2131.68">little custom inspectors so it comes</span> <span data-start="2131.68" data-end="2133.9">here and you can say well this is</span> <span data-start="2133.9" data-end="2135.46">actually a cover back color or page</span> <span data-start="2135.46" data-end="2137.77">whatever and and this is really cool</span> <span data-start="2137.77" data-end="2138.94">because you can write your own custom</span> <span data-start="2138.94" data-end="2140.59">ones of these so if you're using Atlas</span> <span data-start="2140.59" data-end="2143.38">and you have a new UI element you can</span> <span data-start="2143.38" data-end="2145.12">write your own inspectors and you know a</span> <span data-start="2145.12" data-end="2149.59">lot of people to use it yeah and you can</span> <span data-start="2149.59" data-end="2150.79">actually do this interface builder too</span> <span data-start="2150.79" data-end="2151.75">so if you want to write your own IP</span> <span data-start="2151.75" data-end="2153.37">plugins again in the open source world</span> <span data-start="2153.37" data-end="2155.11">without having to deal with us you can</span> <span data-start="2155.11" data-end="2161.05">do that and finally the last thing I</span> <span data-start="2161.05" data-end="2162.79">wanted to show that we're actually</span> <span data-start="2162.79" data-end="2165.58">announcing today this is not part of 0.8</span> <span data-start="2165.58" data-end="2168.79">is an improvement to nip to sip and we</span> <span data-start="2168.79" data-end="2169.9">thought it was a good we've actually had</span> <span data-start="2169.9" data-end="2172.03">this kind of under wraps for a while but</span> <span data-start="2172.03" data-end="2173.74">we thought it was a good time to talk</span> <span data-start="2173.74" data-end="2175.15">about this feature given all the stuff</span> <span data-start="2175.15" data-end="2176.68">that's going on with you know what</span> <span data-start="2176.68" data-end="2178.81">languages you're allowed to use on you</span> <span data-start="2178.81" data-end="2181.12">know iPad and not and I always thought</span> <span data-start="2181.12" data-end="2182.44">it was not a very interesting question</span> <span data-start="2182.44" data-end="2184.21">of you know how to get more stuff into</span> <span data-start="2184.21" data-end="2186.25">the ipad i think you know if Apple wants</span> <span data-start="2186.25" data-end="2189.73">to you know have the lock and key to</span> <span data-start="2189.73" data-end="2191.65">this device that's fine to me much more</span> <span data-start="2191.65" data-end="2193.3">interesting question is how do you get</span> <span data-start="2193.3" data-end="2196.54">stuff that's already on the iPad out so</span> <span data-start="2196.54" data-end="2198.1">as I've already said like we have this</span> <span data-start="2198.1" data-end="2199.42">technology called nip to see which is</span> <span data-start="2199.42" data-end="2202.45">capable of transforming Mac os10 desktop</span> <span data-start="2202.45" data-end="2205.18">apps into html5 web apps well we've</span> <span data-start="2205.18" data-end="2208.03">actually extended you to save to allow</span> <span data-start="2208.03" data-end="2209.59">the same kind of thing to happen with</span> <span data-start="2209.59" data-end="2210.97">iphone app so I'll show you that very</span> <span data-start="2210.97" data-end="2214.6">quickly right here just like before i'm</span> <span data-start="2214.6" data-end="2216.97">going to open up apples tools this is if</span> <span data-start="2216.97" data-end="2218.23">you've never built an iphone app this is</span> <span data-start="2218.23" data-end="2219.64">kind of how you do it these are like</span> <span data-start="2219.64" data-end="2222.82">their visual tools you can come in here</span> <span data-start="2222.82" data-end="2227.87">and you know</span> <span data-start="2227.88" data-end="2232.57">set everything up so I'm obviously</span> <span data-start="2232.57" data-end="2236.41">building something very simple here and</span> <span data-start="2236.41" data-end="2240.55">if I hit run this launches the iPhone</span> <span data-start="2240.55" data-end="2245.08">simulator well this isn't my bug this is</span> <span data-start="2245.08" data-end="2248.16">apple stuff Oh hurt all right there um</span> <span data-start="2248.16" data-end="2250.54">so you know since I'm very obviously a</span> <span data-start="2250.54" data-end="2254.89">very simple out right so what we do is</span> <span data-start="2254.89" data-end="2260.19">if we save this now I can go here and</span> <span data-start="2260.19" data-end="2269.87">just like before i can run new cusub</span> <span data-start="2269.88" data-end="2273.499">oh sorry</span> <span data-start="2273.509" data-end="2276.569">there we go I think Lou the the family</span> <span data-start="2276.569" data-end="2279.539">area so now what the app that started</span> <span data-start="2279.539" data-end="2284.919">off as an iphone / ipad app or whatever</span> <span data-start="2284.929" data-end="2287.009">will show up on the web and it's</span> <span data-start="2287.009" data-end="2288.479">completely converted and this will run</span> <span data-start="2288.479" data-end="2291.929">on android or on palm OS or whatever and</span> <span data-start="2291.929" data-end="2293.549">again we've started off with just like</span> <span data-start="2293.549" data-end="2295.229">three or four classes just like when we</span> <span data-start="2295.229" data-end="2296.459">originally wrote a new to sit for the</span> <span data-start="2296.459" data-end="2298.079">desktop that we're adding more and more</span> <span data-start="2298.079" data-end="2300.239">classes and just like right now in it to</span> <span data-start="2300.239" data-end="2302.039">save is a very very complete tool if</span> <span data-start="2302.039" data-end="2303.959">you're going from desktop to web</span> <span data-start="2303.959" data-end="2305.909">hopefully in a little while this will be</span> <span data-start="2305.909" data-end="2307.499">a very complete tool to go from iphone</span> <span data-start="2307.499" data-end="2309.809">to the web so we're pretty excited about</span> <span data-start="2309.809" data-end="2313.079">that and i guess i'm running out of time</span> <span data-start="2313.079" data-end="2314.429">so i was going to show you a few apps</span> <span data-start="2314.429" data-end="2316.529">running on a late but since i'm at a</span> <span
