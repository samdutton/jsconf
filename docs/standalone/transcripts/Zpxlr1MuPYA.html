data-end="500.55">and the only time that that isn't really</span> <span data-start="500.55" data-end="501.959">the case is in this level up module</span> <span data-start="501.959" data-end="504.27">right level up actually is in a similar</span> <span data-start="504.27" data-end="505.919">position to what you can call a node</span> <span data-start="505.919"

data-end="517.469">actually doesn't so this is a really</span> <span data-start="517.469" data-end="519.18">good thing to look at and to try and</span> <span data-start="519.18" data-end="520.349">figure out you know ways that we might</span> <span data-start="520.349" data-end="522.87">improve note in the future so this is</span> <span data-start="522.87"

very differently</span> <span data-start="541.089" data-end="542.62">than we've seen a lot of open source</span> <span data-start="542.62" data-end="545.589">project from before any key came up with</span> <span data-start="545.589" data-end="547.75">this new system that he called open open</span> <span data-start="547.75" data-end="549.76">source I don't think that the acronym</span> <span data-start="549.76" data-end="550.779">actually means anything he just</span> <span data-start="550.779" data-end="552.58">capitalizes it to reinforce the fact</span> <span data-start="552.58"

data-end="581.92">really good at removing mistakes you</span> <span data-start="581.92" data-end="583.63">can't screw up get the way that you can</span> <span data-start="583.63" data-end="585.16">screw up like a subversion repository</span> <span data-start="585.16" data-end="587.47">and a lot of these crazy kind of</span> <span data-start="587.47"

and easily right like we may want</span> <span data-start="596.26" data-end="598.45">to guard the keys to doing releases and</span> <span data-start="598.45" data-end="600.64">pushing releases to NPM

<span data-start="605.29" data-end="607.42">sort of figured this out he added this</span> <span data-start="607.42" data-end="609.61">to the project he started just giving</span> <span

data-end="616.24">long and what ended up happening was a</span> <span data-start="616.24" data-end="619.18">lot of people including me dominic tar</span> <span data-start="619.18"

of</span> <span data-start="650.47" data-end="652.39">continue to act like a dictator people</span> <span data-start="652.39" data-end="653.8">start to understand that they actually</span> <span

sort of flip out and it's all</span> <span data-start="670.57" data-end="672.67">because they they feel a lack of control</span> <span data-start="672.67" data-end="676.27">over their own work and this model that</span> <span data-start="676.27" data-end="677.89">rod came up with has been hugely</span> <span data-start="677.89" data-end="679.149">successful in avoiding all these</span> <span data-start="679.149" data-end="680.62">pitfalls you know there's a heap there's</span> <span data-start="680.62" data-end="682.42">an amazing active and engaged community</span> <span

data-end="689.5">responsibly without you know all these</span> <span data-start="689.5" data-end="690.97">crazy safeguards that we sort of obsess</span> <span data-start="690.97" data-end="695.77">over okay so um can talk a little bit</span> <span data-start="695.77" data-end="697.26">about notes cool so a lot of people have</span> <span data-start="697.26" data-end="699.82">been doing notes cool we there was one</span> <span data-start="699.82" data-end="701.89">here people talked about new schools lot</span> <span data-start="701.89" data-end="705.63">notes cool it really sort of came out of</span> <span data-start="705.63" data-end="708.459">out of the out of the note conferences</span> <span data-start="708.459" data-end="713.38">so note comp 2012 sub stack wrote this</span> <span data-start="713.38" data-end="716.35">little stream adventure workshop room in</span> <span data-start="716.35" data-end="718.839">fact we heard for that year I decided</span> <span data-start="718.839" data-end="720.37">that note comp was just going to be all</span> <span data-start="720.37" data-end="722.38">hands on and so most people just</span> <span data-start="722.38" data-end="724.27">collaborated on building slides in a</span> <span data-start="724.27" data-end="726.52">whole curriculum and sub-sect tried to</span> <span data-start="726.52" data-end="728.17">do that for about five minutes before he</span> <span data-start="728.17" data-end="730.839">flipped out and was like screw this no</span> <span data-start="730.839" data-end="732.67">and like and then he's like I'm just</span> <span data-start="732.67" data-end="734.29">going to run a module and so he writes</span> <span data-start="734.29" data-end="735.79">this module that's you know an</span> <span data-start="735.79" data-end="738.82">interactive workshop that was by far the</span> <span data-start="738.82" data-end="741.7">best workshop that year everybody really</span> <span data-start="741.7" data-end="744.339">loved it to moxley love the rod bag</span> <span data-start="744.339" data-end="746.529">loved it so much that when he went to to</span> <span data-start="746.529" data-end="749.86">moxies conference camp j/s a few months</span> <span data-start="749.86" data-end="753.04">later he he rewrote all of his workshop</span> <span data-start="753.04" data-end="756.1">materials in a very similar format so</span> <span data-start="756.1" data-end="756.91">that you could have this sort of</span> <span data-start="756.91" data-end="758.92">interactive presentation style and then</span> <span data-start="758.92" data-end="760.75">a few months later at node comfy you</span> <span data-start="760.75" data-end="761.98">there's you know five of these</span> <span data-start="761.98" data-end="764.14">interactive workshops and we put them</span> <span data-start="764.14" data-end="765.73">all under this banner and call it note</span> <span data-start="765.73" data-end="768">school and it really took off from there</span> <span data-start="768" data-end="771.19">and then shortly after that i created</span> <span data-start="771.19" data-end="773.02">this issue and this is like my favorite</span> <span data-start="773.02" data-end="775.3">github issue in the history of open</span> <span data-start="775.3" data-end="778.54">source it's so great so like I just sort</span> <span data-start="778.54" data-end="780.07">of put together resources for people</span> <span data-start="780.07" data-end="783.19">running localized node schools in their</span> <span data-start="783.19" data-end="784.279">town or whatever</span> <span data-start="784.279" data-end="786.99">and I said you know hey run one you know</span> <span data-start="786.99" data-end="788.91">when you're done like totally come back</span> <span data-start="788.91" data-end="791.339">and tell us all about it and so and this</span> <span data-start="791.339" data-end="794.339">thread just blew up for months so tons</span> <span data-start="794.339" data-end="795.87">of people were running these they were</span> <span data-start="795.87" data-end="797.37">coming back and saying what worked and</span> <span data-start="797.37" data-end="799.05">what didn't work we were all inter ating</span> <span data-start="799.05" data-end="801.36">on how we did them and you know people</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="802.589">started sending in all these awesome</span> <span data-start="802.589" data-end="804.51">photos and attaching them to the issue</span> <span data-start="804.51" data-end="807.24">as well so you know these are from and</span> <span data-start="807.24" data-end="808.769">these are from all over the world I mean</span> <span data-start="808.769" data-end="811.32">you know you got London and China and</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="811.32" data-end="814.079">Australia I think there's a little bit</span> <span data-start="814.079" data-end="816.779">of San Francisco in there Columbia like</span> <span data-start="816.779" data-end="819.329">they've met een Columbia's in there and</span> <span data-start="819.329" data-end="820.5">this is all happening within like the</span> <span data-start="820.5" data-end="823.32">first few months and we were so excited</span> <span data-start="823.32" data-end="825.69">that we we kind of didn't notice when</span> <span data-start="825.69" data-end="828.75">growth kind of plateaued like we had a</span> <span data-start="828.75" data-end="830.61">bunch of new people come and run them</span> <span data-start="830.61" data-end="833.01">and then we we basically exhausted I</span> <span data-start="833.01" data-end="834.42">guess the number of people that could</span> <span data-start="834.42" data-end="838.19">just figure this out from that issue and</span> <span data-start="838.19" data-end="841.2">it stagnated for a little while and then</span> <span data-start="841.2" data-end="843.39">you know max Ogden who you may have seen</span> <span data-start="843.39" data-end="846.959">earlier he decided that he was going to</span> <span data-start="846.959" data-end="848.67">sort of like take on some more</span> <span data-start="848.67" data-end="850.2">leadership and organize things a bit and</span> <span data-start="850.2" data-end="852">what he did was one he just documented</span> <span data-start="852" data-end="854.79">very very well how to run a note school</span> <span data-start="854.79" data-end="856.86">you know you don't need it any money you</span> <span data-start="856.86" data-end="858.36">don't need to pay for pizza and beer</span> <span data-start="858.36" data-end="860.85">unless you want to like just you know</span> <span data-start="860.85" data-end="862.29">it's very very simple you know here are</span> <span data-start="862.29" data-end="865.74">these materials that's it but then he he</span> <span data-start="865.74" data-end="868.98">found a way to adopt to adapt rod begs</span> <span data-start="868.98" data-end="871.529">open open source to this like new</span> <span data-start="871.529" data-end="873.839">growing community of note schools</span> <span data-start="873.839" data-end="874.95">because one of the problems that you</span> <span data-start="874.95" data-end="876.779">have in distributing this project is</span> <span data-start="876.779" data-end="877.86">like well how do you share ownership</span> <span data-start="877.86" data-end="880.74">over something that is literally global</span> <span data-start="880.74" data-end="882.149">and people are running them in their</span> <span data-start="882.149" data-end="884.76">local acts in their local community so</span> <span data-start="884.76" data-end="886.2">you created this note school github org</span> <span data-start="886.2" data-end="889.05">and basically anybody who comes along</span> <span data-start="889.05" data-end="890.79">and says I want to run a new node school</span> <span data-start="890.79" data-end="892.709">they get added as an owner of the entire</span> <span data-start="892.709" data-end="895.23">org and then from there they create a</span> <span data-start="895.23" data-end="897.51">repo for their local node school chapter</span> <span data-start="897.51" data-end="899.25">which you know means that they get a</span> <span data-start="899.25" data-end="902.25">website and and also that github repo</span> <span data-start="902.25" data-end="904.05">ends up being an issue tracker for them</span> <span data-start="904.05" data-end="906.18">to organize the event and for anybody</span> <span data-start="906.18" data-end="907.82">that was at the event to follow up later</span> <span data-start="907.82" data-end="910.32">and then then he did something just</span> <span data-start="910.32" data-end="913.38">genius he he told them that at</span> <span data-start="913.38" data-end="915.24">genius he he told them that at the end of every node school they should</span> <span data-start="915.24" data-end="916.74">get the github handles of everybody who</span> <span data-start="916.74" data-end="917.34">attended</span> <span data-start="917.34" data-end="919.14">and add them as an owner of the</span> <span data-start="919.14" data-end="921.36">individual repository so now they're all</span> <span data-start="921.36" data-end="923.16">watching the repo they're all following</span> <span data-start="923.16" data-end="926.16">up and it makes this line between I just</span> <span data-start="926.16" data-end="927.57">learn node I know a little bit more</span> <span data-start="927.57" data-end="929.28">about node now I'm helping out to run a</span> <span data-start="929.28" data-end="931.65">node school now I'm entering it makes</span> <span data-start="931.65" data-end="933.48">that continuum and that transition so</span> <span data-start="933.48" data-end="936.51">simple and easy and it ended again it</span> <span data-start="936.51" data-end="939.75">shares ownership of the localized event</span> <span data-start="939.75" data-end="941.52">which means that people have a shared</span> <span data-start="941.52" data-end="942.99">sense of responsibility for keeping it</span> <span data-start="942.99" data-end="944.94">running it's really genius there's</span> <span data-start="944.94" data-end="947.37">worked incredibly well and now we're i'm</span> <span data-start="947.37" data-end="949.32">on

or being added</span> <span data-start="952.23" data-end="954.18">it's crazy and then you know I have to</span> <span data-start="954.18" data-end="955.77">unsubscribe from this repo because it's</span> <span data-start="955.77" data-end="960.72">like all in Japanese and and and and</span> <span data-start="960.72" data-end="963.27">just recently you know Max's been on a</span> <span data-start="963.27" data-end="964.56">kick of trying to get everybody to</span> <span data-start="964.56" data-end="966.57">translate as well so there's a ton of</span> <span data-start="966.57"
