data-end="47.809">puzzles so what is modernization</span> <span data-start="47.809" data-end="50.94">modernization means very little out of</span> <span data-start="50.94" data-end="54.26">context especially in the software world</span> <span data-start="54.26" data-end="57.93">it's a fun fancy buzzword but I can't</span> <span data-start="57.93" data-end="60.75">really give a whole presentation on how</span> <span data-start="60.75" data-end="63.12">you can apply its principles to your own</span> <span data-start="63.12" data-end="65.549">organization without first establishing</span> <span data-start="65.549" data-end="68.97">some shared context for what I mean</span> <span data-start="68.97" data-end="72.38">when I say it in service of that goal</span> <span data-start="72.38" data-end="75.119">let's start with the most basic</span> <span data-start="75.119" data-end="77.729">definition of the term I could find as</span> <span data-start="77.729" data-end="82.009">it applies to software so as we see here</span> <span data-start="82.009" data-end="84.86">modernization can be understood as the</span> <span data-start="84.86" data-end="89.13">conversion rewriting or porting of a</span> <span data-start="89.13" data-end="92.27">legacy system to a modern language</span> <span data-start="92.27" data-end="96.06">software library protocol or hardware</span> <span data-start="96.06" data-end="100.229">platform that's an OK start but it still</span> <span data-start="100.229" data-end="101.79">leaves us with quite a lot of unanswered</span> <span data-start="101.79" data-end="104.67">questions what does it mean for</span> <span data-start="104.67" data-end="107.549">something to even be modern there's</span> <span data-start="107.549" data-end="109.259">still a lot of wiggle room in that</span> <span data-start="109.259" data-end="112.38">definition that I just gave and even</span> <span data-start="112.38" data-end="114.54">some of its different components might</span> <span data-start="114.54" data-end="116.7">not all be understood in the same way</span> <span data-start="116.7" data-end="120.21">even amongst you the audience for</span> <span data-start="120.21" data-end="122.88">example a highly doubt that we all</span> <span data-start="122.88" data-end="125.52">understand modern language to be the</span> <span data-start="125.52" data-end="129.509">same thing for example beyond the Erb</span> <span data-start="129.509" data-end="132.48">sorry beyond that can modernization even</span> <span data-start="132.48" data-end="133.17">be universe</span> <span data-start="133.17" data-end="136.83">we understood across contexts the answer</span> <span data-start="136.83" data-end="139.59">to that question for better or worse is</span> <span data-start="139.59" data-end="143.16">that it depends and I know that's</span> <span data-start="143.16" data-end="144.51">probably not something a lot of you</span> <span data-start="144.51" data-end="147.54">really love to hear it's kind of like</span> <span data-start="147.54" data-end="149.55">running a non-deterministic software</span> <span data-start="149.55" data-end="152.52">program it doesn't really inspire a</span> <span data-start="152.52" data-end="156.03">whole lot of confidence but I'm not</span> <span data-start="156.03" data-end="157.65">really here today to give you 30 minutes</span> <span data-start="157.65" data-end="160.89">worth of maybe so let's unpack that a</span> <span data-start="160.89" data-end="164.25">little bit further modernization is</span> <span data-start="164.25" data-end="166.23">something that takes on different</span> <span data-start="166.23" data-end="169.86">meanings in different contexts and so</span> <span data-start="169.86" data-end="172.98">for you to really understand and gain</span> <span data-start="172.98" data-end="175.88">concrete lessons from its discussion I'm</span> <span data-start="175.88" data-end="179.25">going to ground it in practical examples</span> <span data-start="179.25" data-end="182.01">from something I work on every day

just to make sure that we all</span> <span data-start="251.7" data-end="254.16">have the same base understanding of what</span> <span data-start="254.16" data-end="258.15">it is electron is the

discussing API versioning an API</span> <span data-start="352.33" data-end="356.919">is fundamentally a contract that you as</span> <span data-start="356.919" data-end="360.37">a maintainer establish with the people</span> <span data-start="360.37" data-end="363.52">consuming your API about how it's going</span> <span data-start="363.52" data-end="368.8">to behave when developers have their API</span> <span data-start="368.8" data-end="372.31">is consumed the consumers are implicitly</span> <span data-start="372.31" data-end="376.18">signing their end of a contract and you</span> <span data-start="376.18" data-end="379.3">as the maintainer are implicitly signing</span> <span data-start="379.3" data-end="383.5">your end you can think of an API a</span> <span data-start="383.5" data-end="386.949">little bit like buying a new car when</span> <span data-start="386.949" data-end="389.169">you buy that car you've probably got a</span> <span data-start="389.169" data-end="391.99">set of expectations for how that car is</span> <span data-start="391.99" data-end="394.779">going to behave and how various controls</span> <span data-start="394.779"

that car and</span> <span data-start="400.509" data-end="403.03">it's pretty it's shiny and you get on</span> <span data-start="403.03" data-end="404.71">the highway and you're going 80 and then</span> <span data-start="404.71" data-end="406.93">suddenly the accelerator and the brake</span> <span data-start="406.93" data-end="409.9">they switch now I don't know about you I</span> <span

data-start="428.02" data-end="429.879">of the questions I had on an earlier</span> <span data-start="429.879" data-end="433.02">slide how do you set these expectations</span> <span data-start="433.02" data-end="436.27">one of the more common ways to set</span> <span data-start="436.27" data-end="439.33">expectations for an API contract is</span> <span data-start="439.33" data-end="442.509">known as semantic versioning or cember</span> <span data-start="442.509" data-end="446.319">in this approach to versioning a version</span> <span data-start="446.319" data-end="449.139">is specified with three

data-end="472.719">apps potential behavior major version</span> <span data-start="472.719" data-end="475.599">bumps are made when you add incompatible</span> <span data-start="475.599" data-end="479.469">or braking API changes minor bumps</span> <span data-start="479.469" data-end="482.229">indicate new but backwards compatible</span> <span data-start="482.229"

data-end="492.189">functionality but nothing new for our</span> <span data-start="492.189" data-end="495.159">purposes today I'm gonna focus on three</span> <span data-start="495.159"

<span data-start="593.57" data-end="595.55">look at how electron handled a recent</span> <span data-start="595.55" data-end="598.79">snafu with just such an issue if you've</span> <span data-start="598.79" data-end="601.13">used Mac OS you'll know that there's a</span> <span data-start="601.13" data-end="604.49">tree bar at the top of the screen the</span> <span data-start="604.49"
