data-end="1538.26">awesome demos and talk about creative</span> <span data-start="1538.26" data-end="1540.78">code and that's also kind of why I was</span> <span data-start="1540.78" data-end="1542.37">still stuck on this poetry ideas like I</span> <span data-start="1542.37" data-end="1544.28">want to work on more things like that so</span> <span data-start="1544.28" data-end="1547.23">we try to start this like creative code</span> <span data-start="1547.23" data-end="1549.03">made up in New York because some are</span> <span data-start="1549.03" data-end="1550.86">happen nothing actually came to fruition</span> <span data-start="1550.86" data-end="1553.14">but we're going to try to meet again I</span> <span data-start="1553.14"

data-end="1559.77">just an idea that I had where you have</span> <span data-start="1559.77" data-end="1562.23">an exquisite corpse but with code so i</span> <span data-start="1562.23" data-end="1564.63">have this repo set up here you guys can</span> <span data-start="1564.63" data-end="1566.49">totally go to that and right now it's</span> <span data-start="1566.49" data-end="1568.77">just i think it's just the terminal like</span> <span data-start="1568.77" data-end="1570.39">spinning out a bunch console logging a</span> <span data-start="1570.39" data-end="1572.64">bunch of random numbers and so the idea</span> <span data-start="1572.64" data-end="1574.77">is to just build on top of that and see</span> <span data-start="1574.77" data-end="1576.929">where all of our collective coding</span> <span data-start="1576.929" data-end="1581.64">knowledge takes us so with that I want</span> <span data-start="1581.64"
