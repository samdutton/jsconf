data-end="281.46">first person ever to think about this as</span> <span data-start="281.46" data-end="283.5">the point of view of like a web designer</span> <span data-start="283.5" data-end="286.56">instead of a web developer and again</span> <span data-start="286.56" data-end="288">like down to the right is not very</span> <span data-start="288" data-end="289.83">flexible for somebody who came at it</span> <span data-start="289.83" data-end="293.19">from print design he had a lot of</span> <span data-start="293.19" data-end="294.27">interesting quotes I'm going to read</span> <span data-start="294.27" data-end="295.53">this to you because it's long and I know</span> <span data-start="295.53" data-end="298.02">like attention spans but this is one of</span> <span data-start="298.02" data-end="299.669">his quotes if you want machines to read</span> <span data-start="299.669" data-end="300.81">your web pages use things like</span> <span data-start="300.81" data-end="302.61">definition lists unordered list headers</span> <span data-start="302.61" data-end="304.83">etc if you want people to read them</span> <span data-start="304.83" data-end="306.75">don't do it they take away your</span> <span data-start="306.75" data-end="309">typographical control specify your own</span> <span data-start="309" data-end="310.83">font sizes when you want to size change</span> <span data-start="310.83" data-end="312.66">if you must use bullets make your own</span> <span data-start="312.66" data-end="314.039">bullets I don't see much point in</span> <span data-start="314.039" data-end="316.41">bullets if your vertical grouping is</span> <span data-start="316.41" data-end="318.78">good and try not to ever number your</span> <span data-start="318.78" data-end="323.07">list items it's hardly ever necessary so</span> <span data-start="323.07" data-end="324.78">he had some crazy ideas and you have</span> <span data-start="324.78" data-end="326.61">probably made Tim berners-lee cry a</span> <span data-start="326.61" data-end="330.21">little bit but again he was from print</span> <span data-start="330.21" data-end="333.419">design and he was just not I mean he</span> <span data-start="333.419" data-end="334.65">just wanted his web pages look good he</span> <span data-start="334.65" data-end="337.5">was not apologetic for it all I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="337.5" data-end="338.58">take you through a few of the tricks</span> <span data-start="338.58" data-end="341.82">that uh that I used back then and then</span> <span data-start="341.82" data-end="343.71">we're kind of popular like so I I was a</span> <span data-start="343.71" data-end="345.27">web developer back then and I've used</span> <span data-start="345.27" data-end="347.699">like probably all of these and done</span> <span data-start="347.699" data-end="350.909">worse things for a while I hosted one by</span> <span data-start="350.909" data-end="353.699">one gif net because i used the you know</span> <span data-start="353.699" data-end="356.789">the single pixel images so much there's</span> <span data-start="356.789" data-end="357.99">pretty bad web designer back that I'm</span> <span data-start="357.99" data-end="359.4">still pretty bad web designer but now</span> <span data-start="359.4" data-end="363.18">use CSS so that's cool so one of the</span> <span data-start="363.18" data-end="364.289">ways you can use these to indenture</span> <span data-start="364.289" data-end="367.169">paragraphs you just take like a short</span> <span data-start="367.169" data-end="369.93">and long gift it's invisible you put it</span> <span data-start="369.93" data-end="371.669">in front of your your paragraph it works</span> <span data-start="371.669" data-end="372.87">fine there was no other way of doing</span> <span data-start="372.87" data-end="374.699">this at the time you could add extra</span> <span data-start="374.699" data-end="376.02">spaces but then the white space was</span> <span data-start="376.02" data-end="378.479">cancelled out so this is kind of the way</span> <span data-start="378.479" data-end="379.74">it worked well except for the fact you</span> <span data-start="379.74" data-end="381">had to put it in front of every</span> <span data-start="381" data-end="383.759">paragraph and now you can just do that</span> <span data-start="383.759" data-end="385.919">with like text indent with CSS it's</span> <span data-start="385.919" data-end="390.449">beautiful you can do eam dashes you just</span> <span data-start="390.449" data-end="392.55">make it a visible gift and you stick it</span> <span data-start="392.55" data-end="393.99">in there now there's no that you could</span> <span data-start="393.99" data-end="395.69">do like to text ashes there were no</span> <span data-start="395.69" data-end="397.94">there wasn't a good way of doing this</span> <span data-start="397.94" data-end="400.5">and you could type</span> <span data-start="400.5" data-end="401.67">the good there's no space between</span> <span data-start="401.67" data-end="403.71">letters it's supposed to be it's like</span> <span data-start="403.71" data-end="404.97">how it's supposed to be from a</span> <span data-start="404.97" data-end="407.37">typographer standpoint it just wreaks</span> <span data-start="407.37" data-end="409.56">havoc on like copy paste and it's it's</span> <span data-start="409.56" data-end="412.56">weird now we have htmlentities you can</span> <span data-start="412.56" data-end="415.97">just drop in and and it works great</span> <span data-start="415.97" data-end="418.71">wasn't there back then you can control</span> <span data-start="418.71" data-end="420.6">line spacing so same thing as the</span> <span data-start="420.6" data-end="423.92">paragraph indent just you know vertical</span> <span data-start="423.92" data-end="427.44">and I should at this time point out that</span> <span data-start="427.44" data-end="429.54">the the V space and via line we have</span> <span data-start="429.54" data-end="430.95">there they don't work anymore not in</span> <span data-start="430.95" data-end="433.29">html5 but they would basically just add</span> <span data-start="433.29" data-end="436.68">spaces on the sides of them you can fake</span> <span data-start="436.68" data-end="438.06">it with width and height by the way</span> <span data-start="438.06" data-end="439.73">which is how I got this to render at all</span> <span data-start="439.73" data-end="442.08">so this works great there's another way</span> <span data-start="442.08" data-end="443.28">of doing this you could maybe at most</span> <span data-start="443.28" data-end="446.06">like double space your lines and stuff</span> <span data-start="446.06" data-end="448.47">but this gave you precise control of</span> <span data-start="448.47" data-end="451.2">your line spacing now you just use line</span> <span data-start="451.2" data-end="453.84">spacing it works really well this is</span> <span data-start="453.84" data-end="456.48">more of the other things were kind of</span> <span data-start="456.48" data-end="457.53">forgivable there's another way of doing</span> <span data-start="457.53" data-end="459.66">this is kind of like a what are you even</span> <span data-start="459.66" data-end="464.19">doing so he this is this is an actual</span> </p>
