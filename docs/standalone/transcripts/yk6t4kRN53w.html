<p><span data-start="15.36" data-end="16.92">I'm going to tell you the story of how</span> <span data-start="16.92" data-end="19.56">assumption metamagic hat and my name is</span> <span data-start="19.56" data-end="22.41">all of lasses and can you see that all</span> <span data-start="22.41" data-end="24.99">the way back I hope the text size is</span> <span data-start="24.99" data-end="26.759">good enough so so you'll find on Twitter</span> <span data-start="26.759" data-end="29.88">a solo and so I'm going to start up by</span> <span data-start="29.88" data-end="31.38">talking a bit about correct code so</span> <span data-start="31.38" data-end="33.69">correct code is a great thing write code</span> <span data-start="33.69" data-end="35.57">that works as we intended it to work</span> <span data-start="35.57" data-end="37.559">that's perfect that is what we are</span> <span data-start="37.559" data-end="40.829">striving for is programmers code that</span> <span data-start="40.829" data-end="43.559">crashes needs improvement it's clearly</span> <span data-start="43.559" data-end="46.079">not correct unless we intend it to crash</span> <span data-start="46.079" data-end="48.69">but at least it crashes so we we know</span> <span data-start="48.69" data-end="49.92">that there is an issue with a bit of</span> <span data-start="49.92" data-end="51.65">code so we can go back and correct it</span> <span data-start="51.65" data-end="54.239">the real issue is when we have incorrect</span> <span data-start="54.239" data-end="56.19">code that keeps on running that is a</span> <span data-start="56.19" data-end="58.47">recipe for disaster I think I strongly</span> <span data-start="58.47" data-end="60.3">believe it is and I strongly believe</span> <span data-start="60.3" data-end="62.55">that we sometimes as programmers focused</span> <span data-start="62.55" data-end="64.47">too much about creating programs that</span> <span data-start="64.47" data-end="66.899">doesn't crash while that should never be</span> <span data-start="66.899" data-end="68.67">our main goal our main goal should be to</span> <span data-start="68.67" data-end="71.399">produce correct programs and in the</span> <span data-start="71.399" data-end="74.13">choice of a program that doesn't crash</span> <span data-start="74.13" data-end="75.75">that keeps on running while it's</span> <span data-start="75.75" data-end="78.09">incorrect and a program that crashes</span> <span data-start="78.09" data-end="80.52">early phase fast so that we know that</span> <span data-start="80.52" data-end="82.729">there's an issue I always pick that one</span> <span data-start="82.729" data-end="84.84">so I guess what I'm saying is that</span> <span data-start="84.84" data-end="86.34">crashing it's a good thing we should</span> <span data-start="86.34" data-end="88.26">crash more we can tell our buses you</span> <span data-start="88.26" data-end="89.97">know crashing that's a good good thing</span> <span data-start="89.97" data-end="92.909">and fail fast as an ID that is actually</span> <span data-start="92.909" data-end="96.18">key to making the robust programs not</span> <span data-start="96.18" data-end="98.79">only fail fast in robust system you know</span> <span data-start="98.79" data-end="100.32">where we have like redundancy that kind</span> <span data-start="100.32" data-end="102.39">of junk but also in you know the normal</span> <span data-start="102.39" data-end="104.52">day-to-day code we write fail fast I</span> <span data-start="104.52" data-end="105.96">think it's something that makes coding</span> <span data-start="105.96" data-end="109.08">more fun and eat better better programs</span> <span data-start="109.08" data-end="112.53">of course it's no silver bullet in</span> <span data-start="112.53" data-end="115.619">itself right so another code is that we</span> <span data-start="115.619" data-end="117.81">actually need to write code that works</span> <span data-start="117.81" data-end="119.43">getting the code right not necessarily</span> <span data-start="119.43" data-end="121.65">from the beginning but we need to</span> <span data-start="121.65" data-end="123.09">iterate on its order it actually works</span> <span data-start="123.09" data-end="126.299">some time but hey let's admit that we</span> <span data-start="126.299" data-end="128.069">make coding mistakes all the time and</span> <span data-start="128.069" data-end="130.5">that has nothing to do with whether we</span> <span data-start="130.5" data-end="132.72">have worked with this language that</span> <span data-start="132.72" data-end="134.579">we're now using for a year or two where</span> <span data-start="134.579" data-end="136.459">it would done it for two decades or</span> <span data-start="136.459" data-end="138.599">whatever you know we make coding</span> <span data-start="138.599" data-end="140.099">mistakes all the time of different types</span> <span data-start="140.099" data-end="143.37">and ironically we even make a lot of</span> <span data-start="143.37" data-end="144.45">mistakes when we are troubleshooting</span> <span data-start="144.45" data-end="146.55">code when we are in the kind of debug</span> <span data-start="146.55" data-end="148.05">mode will go back to code base and try</span> <span data-start="148.05" data-end="148.89">to fix things</span> <span data-start="148.89" data-end="150.33">we do a lot of mistakes and a lot of</span> <span data-start="150.33" data-end="153.15">mistakes that makes us you know that</span> <span data-start="153.15" data-end="154.83">stops us from actually identifying the</span> <span data-start="154.83" data-end="157.65">correct correct issue but also that</span> <span data-start="157.65" data-end="159.48">makes this fixed issue in the wrong ways</span> <span data-start="159.48" data-end="163.2">and the reason for this is because I</span> <span data-start="163.2" data-end="165.69">think it's most has a lot to do with</span> <span data-start="165.69" data-end="168.36">with assumptions so today's systems are</span> <span data-start="168.36" data-end="171.63">so complex and that we need to rely on a</span> <span data-start="171.63" data-end="172.92">lot of abstraction to get things done</span> <span data-start="172.92" data-end="175.709">and that's when we are using other</span> <span data-start="175.709" data-end="176.85">people's called results when you're</span> <span data-start="176.85" data-end="178.68">writing code we need to do it with a lot</span> <span data-start="178.68" data-end="180.87">of abstractions and we need to rely on a</span> <span data-start="180.87" data-end="182.34">lot of assumptions so for instance when</span> <span data-start="182.34" data-end="184.53">it comes to languages there if I use a</span> <span data-start="184.53" data-end="186.39">language that has a program in contract</span> <span data-start="186.39" data-end="188.04">that looks very similar to other</span> <span data-start="188.04" data-end="189.69">languages are used before I kind of</span> <span data-start="189.69" data-end="191.67">assumed that it works the same I would</span> <span data-start="191.67" data-end="193.38">be very surprised if an if statement had</span> <span data-start="193.38" data-end="195.75">you know a negated condition in a</span> <span data-start="195.75" data-end="197.76">language when I'm used to working in</span> <span data-start="197.76" data-end="199.17">some ways and more or less every</span> <span data-start="199.17" data-end="202.44">language created before it and it's also</span> <span data-start="202.44" data-end="204">the same with libraries right so we we</span> <span data-start="204" data-end="205.53">design libraries and ap is with</span> <span data-start="205.53" data-end="207.72">different patterns and if we are in node</span> <span data-start="207.72" data-end="210.989">and and Sony and we start using in a</span> <span data-start="210.989" data-end="213.36">library that doesn't really follow the</span> <span data-start="213.36" data-end="216.69">standard patterns API patterns of known</span> <span data-start="216.69" data-end="218.37">modules we get surprised sometimes we</span> <span data-start="218.37" data-end="221.4">model our libraries after other popular</span> <span data-start="221.4" data-end="223.049">library like a query but you let them</span> <span data-start="223.049" data-end="224.79">work slightly different people will get</span> <span data-start="224.79" data-end="227.13">surprised and and it would be hard to do</span> <span data-start="227.13" data-end="231.48">things so the way I like to think of my</span> <span data-start="231.48" data-end="233.1">brain is that basically it's like a</span> <span data-start="233.1" data-end="235.47">cache pretty small cash but fast it's an</span> <span data-start="235.47" data-end="237.54">l1 cache or something that can only keep</span> <span data-start="237.54" data-end="239.94">so much things in my brain and again</span> <span data-start="239.94" data-end="241.44">therefore I need to rely on a lot of</span> <span data-start="241.44" data-end="243.989">assumptions to get things done now</span> <span data-start="243.989" data-end="246.15">unfortunately there's often a big</span> <span data-start="246.15" data-end="247.59">disconnect between assumptions and</span> <span data-start="247.59" data-end="250.29">reality meaning assumptions what I think</span> <span data-start="250.29" data-end="251.94">the program does in reality what the</span> <span data-start="251.94" data-end="254.579">program really does it might be small</span> <span data-start="254.579" data-end="257.4">truth once like misspelling width and</span> <span data-start="257.4" data-end="261.6">height which always seem to be a problem</span> <span data-start="261.6" data-end="263.4">at least when we will try to identify</span> <span data-start="263.4" data-end="265.11">the problem because it's masked by our</span> <span data-start="265.11" data-end="267.3">brains it off by once you know when we</span> <span data-start="267.3" data-end="269.7">loop one too much or 12 little the</span> <span data-start="269.7" data-end="271.05">different corner cases when we're</span> <span data-start="271.05" data-end="272.88">implementing an algorithm or two and we</span> <span data-start="272.88" data-end="274.169">don't cover that we thought that it</span> <span data-start="274.169" data-end="275.31">would be in the general case but it</span> <span data-start="275.31" data-end="277.02">wasn't there's a disconnect there and</span> <span data-start="277.02" data-end="280.919">and in design in general I think the</span> <span data-start="280.919" data-end="282.81">most obvious case on</span> <span data-start="282.81" data-end="284.669">on that there actually is such a</span> <span data-start="284.669" data-end="286.11">disconnect and how is the problem is</span> <span data-start="286.11" data-end="289.53">when we are debugging when we are but we</span> <span data-start="289.53" data-end="291.33">know that there is an issue in our code</span> <span data-start="291.33" data-end="294.84">perhaps for some reason like a core dump</span> <span data-start="294.84" data-end="297.54">or a crash log or whatever it is we know</span> <span data-start="297.54" data-end="298.889">that there is an issue in this function</span> <span data-start="298.889" data-end="300.3">it's a function of 10 lines of code or</span> <span data-start="300.3" data-end="302.49">something and we have taken upon us the</span> <span data-start="302.49" data-end="305.22">task to fix that bug right so we take</span> <span data-start="305.22" data-end="306.96">that up in our edit or we put a full</span> <span data-start="306.96" data-end="309.15">screen on the screen and we just go line</span> <span data-start="309.15" data-end="311.1">by line trying to read it out trying to</span> <span data-start="311.1" data-end="312.3">reason with ourselves what it's tough</span> <span data-start="312.3" data-end="313.889">dust and it should really work right I</span> <span data-start="313.889" data-end="315.419">have no idea what it doesn't work</span> <span data-start="315.419" data-end="317.729">because it should so if this was C and</span> <span data-start="317.729" data-end="319.47">it was in like the early 90s or</span> <span data-start="319.47" data-end="320.37">something that we could blade in the</span> <span data-start="320.37" data-end="322.2">compiler because the compiler was always</span> <span data-start="322.2" data-end="324">wrong you see how to bugs sometimes in</span> <span data-start="324" data-end="325.53">code generations we can all say hey it's</span> <span data-start="325.53" data-end="327.18">a compiler mistake so I guess the</span> <span data-start="327.18" data-end="328.5">analogy for today is that we should</span> <span data-start="328.5" data-end="331.139">blame guys like Eric and the slob on</span> <span data-start="331.139" data-end="332.82">others in the VA team or or whoever</span> <span data-start="332.82" data-end="335.07">right because the vm might be wrong but</span> <span data-start="335.07" data-end="336.6">often it isn't often it's actually our</span> <span data-start="336.6" data-end="339.9">mistakes we are just not able to find</span> <span data-start="339.9" data-end="342.36">the issues in that code because we have</span> <span data-start="342.36" data-end="344.1">already have our assumption of how it</span> <span data-start="344.1" data-end="347.1">works what you can do then is that you</span> <span data-start="347.1" data-end="348.63">can ask a friend or click or whatever it</span> <span data-start="348.63" data-end="351.32">is perhaps a friend and a colleague and</span> <span data-start="351.32" data-end="353.91">ask both of them to come ask them that</span> <span data-start="353.91" data-end="356.669">person to come sit right next to you so</span> <span data-start="356.669" data-end="358.74">you could you could explain the code to</span> <span data-start="358.74" data-end="361.31">him or her if you start doing that and</span> <span data-start="361.31" data-end="363.479">you start it's playing so this is the</span> <span data-start="363.479" data-end="364.919">function it's called blah blah you know</span> <span data-start="364.919" data-end="366.81">first of all I set up my variables here</span> <span data-start="366.81" data-end="368.61">and I have this this in that object a</span> <span data-start="368.61" data-end="370.05">senator at module and I get something</span> <span data-start="370.05" data-end="373.59">back and then adjust and then you pause</span> <span data-start="373.59" data-end="375.93">because that's that's the moment of</span> <span data-start="375.93" data-end="377.94">enlightenment this the silent moment of</span> <span data-start="377.94" data-end="379.71">enlightenment when you realized exactly</span> <span data-start="379.71" data-end="381.539">what issue was and your friend you don't</span> <span data-start="381.539" data-end="382.919">have to do anything because what</span> <span data-start="382.919" data-end="385.039">happened was that you force yourself to</span> <span data-start="385.039" data-end="387.21">kind of step outside of your own</span> <span data-start="387.21" data-end="389.01">assumptions because you knew that your</span> <span data-start="389.01" data-end="390.9">friend didn't have the same context of</span> <span data-start="390.9" data-end="393.24">this of this program like you did so you</span> <span data-start="393.24" data-end="394.65">have to explain it in more detail and</span> <span data-start="394.65" data-end="396.66">you have to go reevaluate those</span> <span data-start="396.66" data-end="398.31">assumptions in your own brain one more</span> <span data-start="398.31" data-end="402">time and that made you fix the bug how</span> <span data-start="402" data-end="403.889">many have you know anyone else but the</span> <span data-start="403.889" data-end="405.96">mean that I had done that sometimes many</span> <span data-start="405.96" data-end="407.76">of you yeah does anyone know the</span> <span data-start="407.76" data-end="411.479">technique it has a name Oh all of you</span> <span data-start="411.479" data-end="413.28">knows it okay pressure should just end</span> <span data-start="413.28" data-end="414.78">this Tokyo you know this already so</span> <span data-start="414.78" data-end="416.46">rabid up computing</span> <span data-start="416.46" data-end="418.139">you have this rubber tag instead so you</span> <span data-start="418.139" data-end="419.13">cannot have your friend and your</span> <span data-start="419.13" data-end="420.87">colleague and your rubber duck or</span> <span data-start="420.87" data-end="422.699">perhaps in the same cut all of them</span> <span data-start="422.699" data-end="424.38">freebie this I don't know you can have</span> <span data-start="424.38" data-end="425.88">them you can just talk to a rubber duck</span> <span data-start="425.88" data-end="427.77">hey Doc I have this issue and you know</span> <span data-start="427.77" data-end="431.19">things will sell themselves okay so</span> <span data-start="431.19" data-end="433.08">that's for disconnect the brain is a</span> <span data-start="433.08" data-end="434.61">beautiful device right the beautiful</span> <span data-start="434.61" data-end="437.669">thing can you read this I mean can you</span> <span data-start="437.669" data-end="439.41">read it and can you see it and can you</span> <span data-start="439.41" data-end="443.699">read it you can't read it can you see</span> <span data-start="443.699" data-end="445.86">that it's you can see this right so we</span> <span data-start="445.86" data-end="447.36">can read it it's according to recent</span> <span data-start="447.36" data-end="448.83">research the human brain is perfectly</span> <span data-start="448.83" data-end="450.599">able to blah blah blah it's a weird</span> <span data-start="450.599" data-end="452.13">thing because our brain is so good at</span> <span data-start="452.13" data-end="455.34">pattern matching and at at fixing errors</span> <span data-start="455.34" data-end="457.5">so the trick here is that you fix the</span> <span data-start="457.5" data-end="459.03">first and last letter in each and every</span> <span data-start="459.03" data-end="460.53">word in the sentence and you can swap</span> <span data-start="460.53" data-end="461.88">the others around you need to keep</span> <span data-start="461.88" data-end="463.56">letters but you can swap them around but</span>
