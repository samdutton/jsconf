typical day to day engineering role</span> <span data-start="939.94" data-end="942.68">so just quickly touching on what this</span> <span data-start="942.68" data-end="946.269">framework means for other functions I</span> <span data-start="946.269" data-end="948.589">really believe that product managers</span> <span data-start="948.589" data-end="952.13">designers dedicated QA in this</span> <span data-start="952.13" data-end="953.99">environment actually have an even</span> <span data-start="953.99" data-end="958.37">greater potential to to be really high</span> <span data-start="958.37" data-end="962.66">leverage added added teammates because</span> <span data-start="962.66" data-end="965.269">you know when you have engineers that</span> <span data-start="965.269" data-end="968.12">can kind of help out think of help think</span> <span data-start="968.12" data-end="971.3">of product needs when you have engineers</span> <span data-start="971.3" data-end="973.64">that can help with UI UX you have</span> <span data-start="973.64" data-end="975.38">engineers that can test their own code</span> <span data-start="975.38" data-end="978.23">in each other's code it makes their jobs</span> <span data-start="978.23" data-end="980.269">more about adding value and business</span> <span data-start="980.269" data-end="982.94">value and so you can probably have one</span> <span data-start="982.94" data-end="987.35">designer scale out to to you know work</span> <span data-start="987.35" data-end="993.78">on multiple product lines for example</span> <span data-start="993.79" data-end="996.14">and then I just have a flannel talk</span> <span data-start="996.14" data-end="997.07">because I've been talking basically</span> <span data-start="997.07" data-end="998.6">about engineers being really cross</span> <span data-start="998.6" data-end="1000.88">functional and I see this kind of</span> <span data-start="1000.88" data-end="1004.829">happening down the road even now where</span> <span data-start="1004.829" data-end="1007.06">where people can have room to be</span> <span data-start="1007.06" data-end="1008.769">cross-functional I think this is</span> <span data-start="1008.769" data-end="1011.89">something that I will continue to be a</span> <span data-start="1011.89" data-end="1015.329">trend I hope it's a trend and</span> <span data-start="1015.329" data-end="1019.36">specifically with people who are not in</span> <span data-start="1019.36"

data-end="1026.35">responsibilities I guess so some</span> <span data-start="1026.35" data-end="1028.419">examples of this are sales people making</span> <span data-start="1028.419" data-end="1030.49">like lead scoring algorithms you can do</span> <span data-start="1030.49" data-end="1031.78">this in Salesforce you can figure out</span> <span data-start="1031.78"
