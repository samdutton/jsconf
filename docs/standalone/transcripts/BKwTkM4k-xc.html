data-start="609.25" data-end="611.32">to talk about some of the design ideas</span> <span data-start="611.32" data-end="612.58">that guided us in building this</span> <span data-start="612.58"

data-end="620.83">decisions we did so first thing to</span> <span data-start="620.83" data-end="623.19">notice that applications are a target</span> <span data-start="623.19" data-end="625.63">unlike frameworks like jQuery which</span> <span data-start="625.63" data-end="628.54">target websites ennio is entirely</span> <span data-start="628.54" data-end="631.9">allocation framework so if you're going</span> <span data-start="631.9" data-end="633.1">to use this you're going to basically be</span> <span data-start="633.1" data-end="634.45">building it to produce rich applications</span> <span data-start="634.45" data-end="637.24">that pull data from databases from web</span> <span data-start="637.24" data-end="639.459">sources and the show it to the user and</span> <span data-start="639.459" data-end="641.62">give it some way to interact email</span> <span data-start="641.62" data-end="643.87">application is kind of our standard you</span> <span data-start="643.87"

do photo viewers to do a web browser</span> <span data-start="651.69" data-end="657.11">but apps are the kind of key target here</span> <span data-start="657.12" data-end="659.41">one of the big things about nu is that</span> <span data-start="659.41" data-end="663.97">we reuse code through components so you</span> <span data-start="663.97" data-end="665.62">know instead of us you know having your</span> <span data-start="665.62" data-end="667.33">index.html filled with here's a bunch of</span> <span data-start="667.33" data-end="668.68">things about my app you actually build</span> <span

data-end="674.86">an example of some of the ideas behind</span> <span data-start="674.86" data-end="679.15">this so I move this mouse we don't have</span> <span data-start="679.15" data-end="684.07">that spinning cursor there so annual</span> <span data-start="684.07" data-end="686.29">provides this kind system a kind is</span> <span data-start="686.29" data-end="687.82">basically our version of the word class</span> <span data-start="687.82" data-end="689.98">we can't use class by itself because</span> <span data-start="689.98" data-end="691.589">that's the reserved word in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="691.589" data-end="694.3">so every kind of a parent kind going all</span> <span data-start="694.3" data-end="696.1">the way back up to any other object</span> <span data-start="696.1" data-end="698.08">which is kind of the root of a whole</span> <span data-start="698.08" data-end="700.61">the key thing that this whole kind</span> <span data-start="700.61" data-end="704">system gives is the ability to subclass</span> <span data-start="704" data-end="706.399">an existing class and easily call the</span> <span data-start="706.399" data-end="708.92">parent or the methods of the parent so</span> <span data-start="708.92" data-end="710.86">in doing this we have this whole</span> <span data-start="710.86" data-end="713.779">inherited method and so the magical</span> <span data-start="713.779" data-end="715.399">inherit is that it will call your</span> <span data-start="715.399"

so when you're creating these</span> <span data-start="728.66" data-end="730.07">objects you have the ability of</span> <span data-start="730.07" data-end="732.529">specifying properties and then

<span data-start="737.33" data-end="739.94">also provides a kind of magical methods</span> <span data-start="739.94" data-end="741.62">for setting getting and then noting when</span> <span data-start="741.62" data-end="744.649">a property is change which works really</span> <span data-start="744.649" data-end="746.18">well especially if you're building some</span> <span data-start="746.18" data-end="750.95">sort of a online code building UI layout</span> <span data-start="750.95" data-end="753.26">type program we want to actually you set</span> <span

data-start="785.899" data-end="788.899">a very complex infrastructure another</span> <span data-start="788.899" data-end="790.459">thing that we provide is this dollar</span> <span

data-end="810.02">o is to support flexible layouts one of</span> <span data-start="810.02" data-end="810.98">the problems we head back in the</span> <span data-start="810.98" data-end="813.2">original

<span data-start="821.18" data-end="824.51">this well we use the Flex box CSS model</span> <span data-start="824.51" data-end="825.98">that's been supported by WebKit for a</span> <span

kind of combines</span> <span data-start="838.339" data-end="840.529">two lettuce produce a flexible layout</span> <span data-start="840.529" data-end="842.06">where if you change the screen

data-start="845.3" data-end="847.819">then all of a sudden the layout kind of</span> <span data-start="847.819" data-end="849.5">happens for you you don't have to do a</span> <span data-start="849.5" data-end="852.47">lot of extra calculation now recently</span> <span data-start="852.47" data-end="854.06">we've discovered there's some issues</span> <span data-start="854.06" data-end="856.22">with flex boxes they tend to work great</span> <span data-start="856.22" data-end="858.41">at the high level of the application but</span> <span data-start="858.41" data-end="860.93">if you have like a

some</span> <span data-start="864.92" data-end="867.019">speed issues but we've been writing code</span> <span data-start="867.019" data-end="868.97">to basically do kind of fixed versions</span>
