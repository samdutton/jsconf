<span data-start="230.169" data-end="233.709">like this one so I digress</span> <span data-start="233.709" data-end="235.72">so anyway in both of these origins</span> <span data-start="235.72"

an</span> <span data-start="271.379" data-end="278.34">it's just a bug in your code right so</span> <span data-start="278.34" data-end="281.729">the famed computer science a computer</span> <span data-start="281.729" data-end="285.78">scientist Edsger Dijkstra once spoke</span> <span data-start="285.78" data-end="287.84">about how he despised the term bug</span> <span data-start="287.84"

data-end="300.9">instance begin with cleaning up our</span> <span data-start="300.9" data-end="303.84">language by no longer calling a bug a</span> <span data-start="303.84" data-end="306.86">bug but by calling it an error and</span> <span data-start="306.86" data-end="309.33">that's much more honest because it</span> <span data-start="309.33" data-end="310.909">squarely puts the blame where it belongs</span> <span data-start="310.909" data-end="313.169">namely with the programmer who made the</span> <span data-start="313.169" data-end="315.84">air the the animistic metaphor of the</span>

data-end="345.36">confusion so back to yes lint so so what</span> <span data-start="345.36" data-end="346.919">is the point of a linter the point of a</span> <span data-start="346.919" data-end="348.63">linter and the point of the eslint is to</span> <span data-start="348.63" data-end="352.919">catch programmer errors so let's let's</span> <span data-start="352.919" data-end="355.139">dive into the the history of linters and</span> <span data-start="355.139" data-end="358.62">j/s really quickly so jslint was the</span> <span data-start="358.62"

data-start="369.479" data-end="372.09">years that's like a hundred years or</span> <span data-start="372.09" data-end="375.509">something so so then then Gia's hints</span> <span data-start="375.509" data-end="378.029">came out in 2010 and that was basically</span> <span data-start="378.029" data-end="379.56">designed to offer a little more</span> <span data-start="379.56" data-end="380.279">configurability</span> <span data-start="380.279" data-end="383.61">and added a few more rules finally we</span> <span data-start="383.61" data-end="385.229">have es lint which came out in 2013 and</span> <span data-start="385.229" data-end="388.59">that offered better es6 support more</span> <span data-start="388.59" data-end="390.779">rules that specifically rules about a</span> <span data-start="390.779" data-end="393.75">code style so that's like punctuation</span> <span data-start="393.75" data-end="395.279">and things like that that don't have</span> <span data-start="395.279" data-end="397.529">anything to do with correctness as well</span> <span data-start="397.529" data-end="399.719">as a flexible plug-in system that let</span> <span data-start="399.719" data-end="400.139">develop</span> <span data-start="400.139" data-end="404.219">make their own style rules so these</span> <span data-start="404.219" data-end="406.889">three categories of things are what what</span> <span data-start="406.889" data-end="410.039">es Lynch x4 so the first is the most</span> <span data-start="410.039" data-end="412.61">important the first is programmer errors</span> <span data-start="412.61" data-end="415.289">so programmer errors are a correctness</span> <span data-start="415.289" data-end="418.83">issue they they happen when the they</span> <span data-start="418.83" data-end="420.419">basically cause the program to do the</span> <span data-start="420.419" data-end="422.219">wrong thing we never want these in our</span> <span data-start="422.219" data-end="424.199">program there's there's they're never</span> <span data-start="424.199" data-end="428.61">okay basically now best practices these</span> <span data-start="428.61" data-end="432.539">are about avoiding confusing code that</span> <span data-start="432.539" data-end="434.43">they're about avoiding patterns that</span> <span data-start="434.43" data-end="438.509">lead to that often lead to errors so</span> <span data-start="438.509" data-end="440.729">it's possible for code to be correct but</span> <span data-start="440.729" data-end="443.52">still be very confusing and and so so</span> <span data-start="443.52" data-end="446.55">when you when you check for best</span> <span data-start="446.55" data-end="447.719">practices what you're doing is you're</span> <span data-start="447.719" data-end="450.449">it's about minimizing the risk and and</span> <span data-start="450.449" data-end="452.759">also helping with clarity so that</span> <span data-start="452.759" data-end="454.439">programmers that come along later can</span> <span data-start="454.439" data-end="457.31">quickly understand what's going on and</span> <span data-start="457.31" data-end="460.499">lastly we have style issues so these are</span> <span data-start="460.499" data-end="462.96">about spacing punctuation how the code</span> <span data-start="462.96" data-end="467.759">looks and you want a team to agree on</span> <span data-start="467.759" data-end="470.819">like tabs or spaces for instance so the</span> <span data-start="470.819" data-end="474.389">code looks consistent and so the the I</span> <span data-start="474.389" data-end="476.37">guess the ultimate goal here is to to</span> <span data-start="476.37" data-end="477.93">make an entire code base look like it</span> <span data-start="477.93" data-end="481.5">was

a single person</span> <span data-start="483.389" data-end="488.52">that's that's easiest and best for for</span> <span data-start="488.52" data-end="491.099">readability and and and you won't you</span> <span data-start="491.099" data-end="492.81">won't get distracted by you know things</span> <span data-start="492.81" data-end="494.669">that look at a place for example this is</span> <span data-start="494.669" data-end="496.589">why we have copy editors and newspapers</span> <span data-start="496.589" data-end="499.05">at least we used to before we went to</span> <span data-start="499.05" data-end="503.039">online news okay so let's talk about the</span> <span data-start="503.039" data-end="504.689">first and most important use of a winter</span> <span data-start="504.689" data-end="507.149">catching programmer errors so you can</span> <span data-start="507.149" data-end="509.279">obviously just like run your program and</span> <span data-start="509.279" data-end="512.519">try to test all the cases at runtime and</span> <span data-start="512.519" data-end="514.56">and you know that's what qada</span> <span data-start="514.56" data-end="516.209">the point of QA is at the point of</span> <span data-start="516.209" data-end="518.479">integration tests and even unit tests</span> <span data-start="518.479" data-end="520.589">but a linter can help us catch these</span> <span data-start="520.589" data-end="523.26">errors statically which means we should</span> <span data-start="523.26" data-end="525">be shortening the feedback loop we don't</span> <span data-start="525" data-end="527.37">need to run our test suite or or</span> <span data-start="527.37" data-end="529.199">actually use our app and make

<span data-start="534.25" data-end="536.77">catch it immediately ideally directly in</span> <span data-start="536.77" data-end="539.05">our editor so let's look at a few</span> <span data-start="539.05" data-end="540.67">examples of the types of errors that can</span> <span data-start="540.67" data-end="544.87">be detected okay so quick quiz do you</span> <span data-start="544.87" data-end="551.68">see the bug in this code raise your hand</span> <span data-start="551.68" data-end="554.61">if you see it okay</span> <span data-start="554.61" data-end="557.32">not very many yeah it's tricky</span> <span data-start="557.32" data-end="558.88">it's it's subtle basically what's going</span> <span data-start="558.88" data-end="560.29">on is the for loop is going in the

data-end="587.65">your users in production so a for loop</span> <span data-start="587.65" data-end="588.82">with the stop condition that can never</span> <span data-start="588.82" data-end="591.97">be

example of</span> <span data-start="595" data-end="596.62">a rule that he has not will enforce for</span> <span data-start="596.62" data-end="600.94">you here's another one this is another</span> <span data-start="600.94" data-end="604.26">useful one so this is this is a</span> <span data-start="604.26" data-end="606.339">assignment that's actually happening</span> <span data-start="606.339" data-end="608.82">inside this conditional so it's actually</span> <span data-start="608.82" data-end="611.08">going to always be a truthy value or</span> <span data-start="611.08" data-end="613.33">actually not comparing the string to the</span> <span data-start="613.33" data-end="615.97">to the property here it's actually a</span> <span data-start="615.97" data-end="617.589">signing manager manager string to the</span> <span data-start="617.589" data-end="619.63">property and then returning the value of</span> <span data-start="619.63" data-end="620.83">that whole expression is the string</span> <span data-start="620.83" data-end="621.82">manager so it's always gonna be true</span> <span data-start="621.82" data-end="624.55">the —  so this is easy mistake to make</span> <span data-start="624.55" data-end="627.7">but it's very easy for a linter to</span> <span data-start="627.7" data-end="630.52">detect so this is another example</span> <span data-start="630.52" data-end="633.19">something that you'll get saved by feeis</span> <span data-start="633.19" data-end="635.68">lint let's do a few more so here's</span> <span data-start="635.68" data-end="638.17">another one um this one here is this is</span> <span data-start="638.17" data-end="642.37">actually this is an example of really</span> <span data-start="642.37" data-end="643.39">something that probably should have just</span> <span data-start="643.39" data-end="645.13">been like a syntax error in the language</span> <span data-start="645.13" data-end="648.25">honestly having having parameters to a</span> <span data-start="648.25" data-end="649.99">function that are named exactly the same</span> <span data-start="649.99" data-end="652.93">like that's so silly that that's all</span> <span data-start="652.93" data-end="655.99">hard but but it is and so what actually</span> <span data-start="655.99" data-end="658.12">happens is the second parameter that</span> <span data-start="658.12" data-end="660.1">will actually take will actually shadow</span> <span data-start="660.1" data-end="662.95">the preceding one and so this this is</span> <span data-start="662.95" data-end="664.649">probably like a typo and</span> <span data-start="664.649" data-end="665.759">practice is probably typos in your</span> <span data-start="665.759" data-end="668.43">codebase or like something that happened</span> <span data-start="668.43" data-end="671.149">by accident while refactoring and so</span> <span data-start="671.149" data-end="673.11">this will just you know yes some will</span> <span data-start="673.11" data-end="676.939">just catch this for you here's one more</span> <span data-start="676.939" data-end="680.04">so this rule enforces comparing type of</span> <span data-start="680.04" data-end="685.079">to valid string literals so type of can</span> <span data-start="685.079" data-end="686.879">only return one of like five or six</span> <span data-start="686.879" data-end="689.339">strings so let's just make sure that</span> <span data-start="689.339" data-end="690.899">every where we're using type of we're</span> <span data-start="690.899" data-end="692.249">comparing it to one of those five or six</span> <span data-start="692.249" data-end="693.749">strings if we compare it to any other</span> <span data-start="693.749" data-end="696.86">string than those five or six then we're</span> <span data-start="696.86" data-end="700.17">it's always gonna be false so it's an</span> <span data-start="700.17" data-end="706.199">error this one's kind of subtle so if</span> <span data-start="706.199" data-end="707.85">you actually have a reg X in your code</span> <span data-start="707.85" data-end="709.92">base that uses the literal the reg X</span> <span data-start="709.92" data-end="711.809">literal syntax that's the one with the</span> <span data-start="711.809" data-end="713.79">slashes where you put your X between the</span> <span data-start="713.79" data-end="716.67">two slashes that one is actually parsed</span> <span data-start="716.67" data-end="719.819">and if you have an invalid reg X that</span> <span data-start="719.819" data-end="721.199">will be caught and it'll be a syntax</span> <span data-start="721.199" data-end="723.72">error but if you have one that's a</span> <span data-start="723.72" data-end="725.129">string and you're doing Arreaga click</span> <span data-start="725.129" data-end="727.35">this then then this is going to be</span> <span data-start="727.35" data-end="729.059">caught at runtime only when this code</span> <span data-start="729.059" data-end="731.79">code path is executed but we can catch</span> <span data-start="731.79" data-end="734.029">this with the winter</span> <span data-start="734.029" data-end="735.959">okay so there's dozens more of these</span> <span data-start="735.959" data-end="738.12">they're all great things to check in</span> <span data-start="738.12" data-end="740.129">your code and you can you can get them</span> <span data-start="740.129" data-end="740.999">all but I'm not going to go over them</span> <span data-start="740.999" data-end="743.55">all obviously okay so let's let's take a</span> <span data-start="743.55" data-end="745.019">break from talking about the examples of</span> <span data-start="745.019" data-end="746.37">things that can be caught and let's talk</span> <span data-start="746.37" data-end="749.429">about how you actually use es lines</span> <span data-start="749.429" data-end="750.839">because you obviously want to use it now</span> <span data-start="750.839" data-end="755.939">right so you make an es on our C file</span> <span data-start="755.939" data-end="757.529">and add it to your code base this is</span> <span data-start="757.529" data-end="760.37">actually the one that standard uses it's</span> <span data-start="760.37" data-end="763.279">over 200 lines long</span> <span data-start="763.279" data-end="766.889">so yes the config files can be really</span> <span data-start="766.889" data-end="769.35">long they're often really long and if</span> <span data-start="769.35" data-end="770.97">you don't want to decide on each of</span> <span data-start="770.97" data-end="773.759">these rules one at a time you can extend</span> <span data-start="773.759" data-end="775.85">what's what's called a shareable config</span> <span data-start="775.85" data-end="778.529">c by extending a shareable config that</span> <span data-start="778.529" data-end="780.6">gets you a bunch of rules that you can</span> <span data-start="780.6" data-end="783.929">inherit by default so in this case we're</span> <span data-start="783.929" data-end="787.879">inheriting from the standard rule set</span> <span data-start="787.879" data-end="790.079">there's a few other alternatives you can</span> <span data-start="790.079" data-end="792.209">look at there's one by Airbnb that's</span> <span data-start="792.209" data-end="793.649">really popular and there's another one</span> <span data-start="793.649" data-end="795.389">by Google that's quite popular as well</span> <span data-start="795.389" data-end="797.309">it doesn't matter which one you choose</span> <span data-start="797.309" data-end="798.27">just pick one</span> <span data-start="798.27" data-end="803.31">and stick with it one thing I'll say</span> <span data-start="803.31" data-end="805.11">though is if you use an ESL into our C</span> <span data-start="805.11" data-end="806.28">file in your codebase</span> <span data-start="806.28" data-end="809.43">beware of rule overrides so one</span> <span data-start="809.43" data-end="811.65">disadvantage to using this file is that</span> <span data-start="811.65" data-end="814.92">anyone can go in and override the rules</span> <span data-start="814.92" data-end="818.31">by just adding a new line to this rules</span> <span data-start="818.31" data-end="822.9">array here and that's where standard</span> <span data-start="822.9" data-end="824.64">comes in so so and this is where</span> <span data-start="824.64" data-end="828.9">standard really shines so it's it's more</span> <span data-start="828.9" data-end="831.09">than a shareable config it's actually an</span> <span data-start="831.09" data-end="833.22">entire command line program that you</span> <span data-start="833.22" data-end="836.01">install and then you run directly and it</span> <span data-start="836.01" data-end="837.42">comes with the more than 200</span> <span data-start="837.42" data-end="840.33">pre-configured you slunt rules but the</span> <span data-start="840.33" data-end="841.86">thing is it bundles them up into a</span> <span data-start="841.86" data-end="844.56">single command that you can just run or</span> <span data-start="844.56" data-end="847.89">that you can add to your test suite so</span> <span data-start="847.89" data-end="850.59">this is how you would use it and I think</span> <span data-start="850.59" data-end="851.94">it's the easiest way to add a linter to</span> <span data-start="851.94" data-end="853.68">your project because there's no need to</span> <span data-start="853.68" data-end="855.75">setup any config files there's no need</span> <span data-start="855.75" data-end="857.16">to decide on which rules you're going to</span> <span data-start="857.16" data-end="860.37">use you just install it and then you run</span> <span data-start="860.37" data-end="861.63">it and then it tells you whether your</span> <span data-start="861.63" data-end="865.26">code passes or not you can also add — -</span> <span data-start="865.26" data-end="867.48">fix and it will try to fix any errors</span> <span data-start="867.48" data-end="869.25">that it sees so for example this error</span> <span data-start="869.25" data-end="871.92">here with the triple equals can be a can</span> <span data-start="871.92" data-end="873.18">be actually fixed automatically in some</span> <span data-start="873.18" data-end="877.98">cases which is really nice so standard</span> <span data-start="877.98" data-end="879.66">has a vibrant community it's downloaded</span> <span data-start="879.66" data-end="881.34">a million times per month and there's</span> <span data-start="881.34" data-end="883.23">editor plug-ins for every major editor</span> <span data-start="883.23" data-end="885.51">and it's also built into the webstorm</span> <span data-start="885.51"

to make this too much of a sales</span> <span data-start="892.17" data-end="896.37">pitch but I will say that oh yeah this</span> <span data-start="896.37" data-end="898.47">is just how to how to add it as a dev</span> <span data-start="898.47" data-end="901.11">dependency you can you can then just add</span> <span data-start="901.11" data-end="904.2">standard to your test script and

data-start="907.34" data-end="910.71">the point is that you should probably be</span> <span data-start="910.71" data-end="912.78">using you know yes lint or standard or</span> <span data-start="912.78" data-end="914.07">something like this in your code and you</span> <span data-start="914.07" data-end="917.07">probably already are but I guess I want</span> <span
