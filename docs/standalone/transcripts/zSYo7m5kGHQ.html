data-start="16.099" data-end="18.47">talking about component libraries and</span> <span data-start="18.47" data-end="20.3">you might say what's the component</span> <span data-start="20.3" data-end="22.849">library which is what everyone at my</span> <span data-start="22.849" data-end="25.25">company said when I said hey let's build</span> <span data-start="25.25" data-end="28.88">a component library so I try to make it</span> <span data-start="28.88" data-end="31.509">easier for them everyone had heard of</span> <span data-start="31.509" data-end="35.78">bootstrap and so at work I started</span> <span data-start="35.78" data-end="39.04">working on something called boot stripe</span> <span data-start="39.04" data-end="43.16">it's pretty good you'll get it it'll</span> <span data-start="43.16" data-end="48.38">come to you uh so i encourage you to</span> <span data-start="48.38" data-end="51.68">build your own component library mainly</span> <span data-start="51.68" data-end="53.48">so you get to make your own something</span> <span data-start="53.48" data-end="57.41">strap j/s comp strap whatever you want</span> <span data-start="57.41" data-end="59.329">to do stripes trap didn't work quite as</span> <span data-start="59.329" data-end="61.7">well as boot stripe so that's what we</span> <span data-start="61.7" data-end="64.54">want with but oh why right one at all</span> <span data-start="64.54" data-end="67.25">you could just build your application</span> <span data-start="67.25" data-end="68.689">and then when you get to a button you</span> <span data-start="68.689" data-end="70.64">style the button and then when you get</span> <span data-start="70.64" data-end="73.63">to a drop-down you style the drop-down</span> <span data-start="73.63" data-end="76.19">just like we've made web applications</span> <span data-start="76.19" data-end="79.549">for a really long time so I've prepared</span> <span data-start="79.549" data-end="82.82">a list of facts that are definitely true</span> <span data-start="82.82" data-end="87.14">about CSS the first CSS fact is that</span> <span data-start="87.14" data-end="89.78">once you write a line of CSS it can</span> <span data-start="89.78" data-end="94.58">never be deleted it sounds like a myth</span> <span data-start="94.58" data-end="96.409">what if you think about your app you're</span> <span data-start="96.409" data-end="98.09">always just a little too scared to</span> <span data-start="98.09" data-end="101.36">remove code and so you just add new</span> <span data-start="101.36" data-end="105.74">classes to go over those ones so i like</span> <span data-start="105.74" data-end="108.76">to call CSS an append only language</span> <span data-start="108.76" data-end="114.83">that's good you get code like this this</span> <span data-start="114.83" data-end="116.45">is my favorite I always see blocks like</span> <span data-start="116.45" data-end="117.71">this that you put this on a div it</span> <span data-start="117.71" data-end="121.159">literally does nothing but you're like</span> <span data-start="121.159" data-end="123.77">well is it overriding the padding is</span> <span data-start="123.77" data-end="126.47">that I'm just gonna leave this here this</span> <span data-start="126.47" data-end="129.2">is fine I think it's not hurting anyone</span> <span data-start="129.2" data-end="134.379">so never remove it yeah so the fact 2is</span> <span data-start="134.379" data-end="137.39">preprocessors are great as long as you</span> <span data-start="137.39" data-end="140.06">know exactly what the output this is my</span> <span data-start="140.06" data-end="144.709">favorite way of looking at nesting very</span> <span data-start="144.709" data-end="148.13">common output for you gzip lovers this</span> <span data-start="148.13" data-end="151.34">is like a your best-case scenario though</span> <span data-start="151.34" data-end="154.4">so that's pretty great CSS fact three is</span> <span data-start="154.4" data-end="157.16">that no two people write CSS in a</span> <span data-start="157.16" data-end="161.39">similar way I feel like I work with some</span> <span data-start="161.39" data-end="163.04">of the smartest people in the universe</span> <span data-start="163.04" data-end="165.65">and this is probably about as best as I</span> <span data-start="165.65" data-end="169.31">could ask for literally every type of</span> <span data-start="169.31" data-end="171.41">casing and then some casings that don't</span> <span data-start="171.41" data-end="176.54">actually exist so yeah I'm sure you</span> <span data-start="176.54" data-end="179.09">recognize the naming schemes from your</span> <span data-start="179.09" data-end="181.78">own code and that's why you're laughing</span> <span data-start="181.78" data-end="185.51">so CSS fact for is you cannot test to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="185.51" data-end="188.93">CSS it doesn't run in a way that you can</span> <span data-start="188.93" data-end="190.91">get stuff out there's not really good</span> <span data-start="190.91" data-end="194.66">joke for this once I'll move to CSS 5 so</span> <span data-start="194.66" data-end="196.43">you can't upgrade to a new version of</span> <span data-start="196.43" data-end="199.45">bootstrap without an animal sacrifice</span> <span data-start="199.45" data-end="202.879">and I decided not to include an image</span> <span data-start="202.879" data-end="207.14">for that one so deleting code and</span> <span data-start="207.14" data-end="210.41">testing actually go hand in hand the</span> <span data-start="210.41" data-end="212.239">easiest way to feel comfortable deleting</span> <span data-start="212.239" data-end="215.18">something is to make sure that you have</span> <span data-start="215.18" data-end="216.23">tests to make sure it doesn't break</span> <span data-start="216.23" data-end="218.54">something whenever you delete it so</span> <span data-start="218.54" data-end="221.15">component libraries are well tested and</span> <span data-start="221.15" data-end="223.909">highly reusable libraries for for UI</span> <span data-start="223.909" data-end="228.53">components they would be ridiculous to</span> <span data-start="228.53" data-end="230.9">test if you did them inside of your</span> <span data-start="230.9" data-end="232.519">application so in a component library</span> <span data-start="232.519" data-end="235.069">you're often testing that when you hover</span> <span data-start="235.069" data-end="237.739">and it's active and the keyboard focuses</span> <span data-start="237.739" data-end="240.5">on and you're looking sideways that the</span> <span data-start="240.5" data-end="243.59">the the thing comes around the edges of</span> <span data-start="243.59" data-end="245.51">the button correctly and if you did that</span> <span data-start="245.51" data-end="247.58">inside your application every time you</span> <span data-start="247.58" data-end="249.34">had a button that would be ridiculous</span> <span data-start="249.34" data-end="252.08">but luckily with a component library you</span> <span data-start="252.08" data-end="254.33">can kind of focus on those nice detailed</span> <span data-start="254.33" data-end="258.47">things and so the reason why this is</span> <span data-start="258.47" data-end="261.109">important is because this is me on a</span> <span data-start="261.109" data-end="263.539">good day that's probably my best outfit</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="263.539" data-end="265.129">I look really sharp I had a recent</span> <span data-start="265.129" data-end="266.99">haircut I'm next to something involving</span> <span data-start="266.99" data-end="269.52">art</span> <span data-start="269.53" data-end="272.12">it looks like everything even matches my</span> <span data-start="272.12" data-end="274.07">clothes are on the right direction it's</span> <span data-start="274.07" data-end="277.01">pretty good day for me the code that i</span> <span data-start="277.01" data-end="278.27">read on this day is going to be</span> <span data-start="278.27" data-end="280.79">well-intentioned i'm clear thinking and</span> <span data-start="280.79" data-end="281.93">i'm going to do things for the right</span> <span data-start="281.93" data-end="287.99">reason this is me on a normal day was</span> <span data-start="287.99" data-end="289.4">about ninety percent of the time</span> <span data-start="289.4" data-end="291.7">ninety-nine percent of the time AV and</span> <span data-start="291.7" data-end="294.23">component libraries are all about making</span> <span data-start="294.23" data-end="296.3">sure that this version of yourself</span> <span data-start="296.3" data-end="300.05">doesn't ruin the app for everybody so</span> <span data-start="300.05" data-end="301.61">use your best days to build up</span> <span data-start="301.61" data-end="303.89">components that you can use mindlessly</span> <span data-start="303.89" data-end="307.49">on your worst days so you can do things</span> <span data-start="307.49" data-end="310.31">like keyboard accessibility I put in a</span> <span data-start="310.31" data-end="313.31">fancy thing Oh responsiveness there you</span> <span data-start="313.31" data-end="317.78">go oh I don't know actually how keynote</span> <span data-start="317.78" data-end="321.17">trans transitions work so forgive me</span> <span data-start="321.17" data-end="323.72">that was sweet focus states it's the</span> <span data-start="323.72" data-end="325.34">only way focus states can be interesting</span> <span data-start="325.34" data-end="329.75">as if they sparkle so active hover focus</span> <span data-start="329.75" data-end="331.07">like I talked about for and that's real</span> <span data-start="331.07" data-end="333.98">we really have styles that if you have</span> <span data-start="333.98" data-end="336.11">been using your keyboard and you're</span> <span data-start="336.11" data-end="338.51">pressing down and your mouse happens to</span> <span data-start="338.51" data-end="340.01">be over something like you can't have</span> <span data-start="340.01" data-end="342.02">some weird stay that's a real estate and</span> <span data-start="342.02" data-end="344.66">you've never considered it before I hope</span> <span data-start="344.66" data-end="348.02">but I hope you do in the future because</span> <span data-start="348.02" data-end="352.19">of this stuff so it turns this this very</span> <span data-start="352.19" data-end="357.04">crappy but well-intentioned Mario clay</span> <span data-start="357.04" data-end="360.02">you know it's fully sculpted like there</span> <span data-start="360.02" data-end="361.43">was no instruction manual there's</span> <span data-start="361.43" data-end="363.65">nothing anyone can do to help you make</span> <span data-start="363.65" data-end="368.75">your perfect fairly flawed Mario and it</span> <span data-start="368.75" data-end="371.27">turns that into this which is you know</span> <span data-start="371.27" data-end="372.65">you have building blocks you have pieces</span> <span data-start="372.65" data-end="374.45">and you have instructions on how to put</span> <span data-start="374.45" data-end="376.76">it all together and so we do the same</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="379.81">thing for boot stripe we have this</span> <span data-start="379.81" data-end="382.01">documentation that looks beautiful on</span> <span data-start="382.01" data-end="384.89">this screen and we have what something</span> <span data-start="384.89" data-end="386.63">is we have how to use it we have</span> <span data-start="386.63" data-end="389.87">examples of it being used and that</span> <span data-start="389.87" data-end="391.82">really helps create consistency for</span> <span data-start="391.82" data-end="393.89">developers on how they integrate things</span> <span data-start="393.89" data-end="396.5">but also helps create consistency for</span> <span data-start="396.5" data-end="398.51">your end users every time that they</span> <span data-start="398.51" data-end="400.94">encounter a button every time they</span> <span data-start="400.94" data-end="402.72">encounter a nav menu</span> <span data-start="402.72" data-end="403.47">we're going to know what's going to work</span> <span data-start="403.47" data-end="409.17">the same way each time bonus everyone</span> <span data-start="409.17" data-end="412.08">has like the admin toolbar back-end</span> <span data-start="412.08" data-end="414.32">thing and it's really great that now</span> <span data-start="414.32" data-end="416.91">whenever we build these stupid crappy</span> <span data-start="416.91" data-end="418.95">internal applications you can just use</span> <span data-start="418.95" data-end="420.57">your thing and it kind of looks like you</span> <span data-start="420.57" data-end="423.87">tried it's just bonus so how can you</span> <span data-start="423.87" data-end="426.63">make a component library or more</span> <span data-start="426.63" data-end="428.7">specifically how can I make a component</span> <span data-start="428.7" data-end="431.88">library and it's going to be any better</span> <span data-start="431.88" data-end="435.03">than just using bootstrap out of the box</span> <span data-start="435.03" data-end="437.16">that's a good question you you probably</span> <span data-start="437.16" data-end="438.78">could use bootstrap for a lot of stuff</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="441.72">but bootstraps core competency is</span> <span data-start="441.72" data-end="444.18">generic pneus it wants to be the</span> <span data-start="444.18" data-end="446.73">baseline it has no styles on buttons and</span> <span data-start="446.73" data-end="450">it's fairly accessible but everything</span> <span data-start="450" data-end="451.35">looks the same and people are pretty</span> <span data-start="451.35" data-end="453.66">tired of bootstrap websites by now if</span> <span data-start="453.66" data-end="456.21">you get in on bootstrap for early enough</span> <span data-start="456.21" data-end="457.74">maybe that'll be cool for like a month</span> <span data-start="457.74" data-end="460.14">or two so first thing you want to do is</span> <span data-start="460.14" data-end="463.65">choose a preprocessor not strictly</span> <span data-start="463.65" data-end="465.51">necessary but really helps if you're</span> <span data-start="465.51" data-end="467.1">parsing CSS you can do a lot of the</span> <span data-start="467.1" data-end="468.15">testing
