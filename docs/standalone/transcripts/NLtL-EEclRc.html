<p><span data-start="115.159" data-end="118.13">Storify and DocuSign early users of</span> <span data-start="118.13" data-end="118.88">nodejs</span> <span data-start="118.88" data-end="122.06">so I know what I'm talking about more or</span> <span data-start="122.06" data-end="122.929">less</span> <span data-start="122.929" data-end="125.24">Capital one it's famous for its Viking</span> <span

data-end="135.71">lot of gifts only two more okay so let's</span> <span data-start="135.71" data-end="138.08">start with basics first of all like why</span> <span data-start="138.08" data-end="140.6">do we even want to use node.js right</span> <span data-start="140.6" data-end="144.23">because we might have people completely</span> <span data-start="144.23" data-end="145.81">new to know the ass</span> <span data-start="145.81" data-end="149.18">so there are typically two categories of</span> <span data-start="149.18" data-end="152.15">systems one is input and output bount</span> <span data-start="152.15" data-end="154.7">and another a cpu-bound so when we're</span> <span data-start="154.7" data-end="157.239">building web applications we're usually</span> <span data-start="157.239" data-end="160.159">working with the input and output bound</span> <span data-start="160.159" data-end="162.89">systems so what is input and output it</span> <span data-start="162.89" data-end="165.26">could be writing to the database as</span> <span data-start="165.26" data-end="169.01">making a request to a server or a third</span> <span data-start="169.01" data-end="172.42">party service or doing something else</span> <span data-start="172.42" data-end="176.269">which is usually takes a lot of time</span> <span data-start="176.269" data-end="180.409">just for the waiting for that process so</span> <span data-start="180.409" data-end="182.09">know just has the thing it's called</span> <span data-start="182.09" data-end="185.54">non-blocking i/o now or non-blocking</span> <span data-start="185.54" data-end="189.879">input and output why this is good so</span> <span data-start="189.879" data-end="192.73">when we're working with nodejs and</span> <span data-start="192.73" data-end="195.65">usually we're building web servers we</span> <span data-start="195.65" data-end="197.959">might have some clients making requests</span> <span data-start="197.959" data-end="201.26">so under the hood of nodejs we have a</span> <span data-start="201.26" data-end="203.959">vent loop which was borrowed from google</span> <span data-start="203.959" data-end="207.17">chrome v8 engine so that event loop is</span> <span data-start="207.17" data-end="209.329">always looking for things to execute and</span> <span data-start="209.329" data-end="212.239">then it delegates the actual jobs the</span> <span data-start="212.239" data-end="215.359">actual processes to some other systems</span> <span data-start="215.359" data-end="218.9">for example a file system or database</span> <span data-start="218.9" data-end="224.359">etc so when the delegation happens event</span> <span data-start="224.359" data-end="227.15">loop also passes the callback which is</span> <span data-start="227.15" data-end="229.609">typically some JavaScript or node.js</span> <span data-start="229.609" data-end="232.549">code and when the system is done it's</span> <span data-start="232.549" data-end="234.62">over it's finished that callback is</span> <span data-start="234.62" data-end="237.29">executed and usually that go back has</span> <span data-start="237.29" data-end="239.9">the code to send back the data to the</span> <span data-start="239.9" data-end="241.819">client if we're talking about web</span> <span data-start="241.819" data-end="245.03">servers so how many of your Java</span> <span data-start="245.03" data-end="249.349">developers or started with Java okay so</span> <span data-start="249.349" data-end="251.93">even if you're not hardcore Java</span> <span data-start="251.93" data-end="253.669">developer you kind of guess what is</span> <span data-start="253.669" data-end="256.459">happening here there is a sleep method</span> <span data-start="256.459" data-end="260.51">and the key here probably this is the</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="262.28">most important piece in like the whole</span> <span data-start="262.28" data-end="265.07">presentation the key here is that Java</span> <span data-start="265.07" data-end="268.97">process will be put into so to say sleep</span> <span data-start="268.97" data-end="272.419">so nothing will be executed until that</span> <span data-start="272.419" data-end="275.24">one second passes so 1,000 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="275.24" data-end="278.78">or one second blocks the entire process</span> <span data-start="278.78" data-end="282.94">game contrat that with this node.js code</span> <span data-start="282.94" data-end="286.1">where we're scheduling the process in</span> <span data-start="286.1" data-end="288.59">the future by using a callback so that</span> <span data-start="288.59" data-end="290.57">function is sort of a set timeout it's</span> <span data-start="290.57" data-end="293.36">not executed right away it will be</span> <span data-start="293.36" data-end="296.54">executed in the future so from step one</span> <span data-start="296.54" data-end="299.18">we skip right to the step two then one</span> <span data-start="299.18" data-end="302.06">second passes and we would see step</span> <span data-start="302.06" data-end="305">three so why this is good because we</span> <span data-start="305" data-end="307.669">could execute more code while the</span> <span data-start="307.669" data-end="310.34">waiting is happening so the waiting is</span> <span data-start="310.34" data-end="311.51">not actually sleeping</span> <span data-start="311.51" data-end="314.33">it's just scheduling in the future so we</span> <span data-start="314.33" data-end="316.37">would see step one step two then we</span> <span data-start="316.37" data-end="318.62">would see step four and then we would</span> <span data-start="318.62" data-end="321.8">see after 1000 milliseconds step three</span> <span data-start="321.8" data-end="323.9">and step five so this is probably the</span> <span data-start="323.9" data-end="326.96">most important piece from this whole</span> <span data-start="326.96" data-end="330.38">presentation not just allows you to</span> <span data-start="330.38" data-end="334.69">write faster applications typically</span> <span data-start="334.69" data-end="337.52">because we're utilizing that idle</span> <span data-start="337.52" data-end="340.91">waiting time so let's talk about web</span> <span data-start="340.91" data-end="343.13">servers a little bit so this is how we</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="345.83">would write a web server schematically</span> <span data-start="345.83" data-end="349.4">of course just a diagram using some of</span> <span data-start="349.4" data-end="352.34">those blocking i/o systems like Python</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="352.34" data-end="356.539">Ruby Java etc each subsequent request</span> <span data-start="356.539" data-end="358.94">would be blocked by the previous request</span> <span data-start="358.94" data-end="361.28">so you have the queue and they have to</span> <span data-start="361.28" data-end="364.46">wait in that queue I always like to give</span> <span data-start="364.46" data-end="366.38">this a knowledge of a coffee shop you go</span> <span data-start="366.38" data-end="368.8">to coffee shop and you order your drink</span> <span data-start="368.8" data-end="372.08">he or she the barista the cashier at the</span> <span data-start="372.08" data-end="374.33">register they would take your order they</span> <span data-start="374.33" data-end="376.16">would take your money and then they</span> <span data-start="376.16" data-end="379.27">would turn around and make you drink and</span> <span data-start="379.27" data-end="382.19">usually that leads to long lines people</span> <span data-start="382.19" data-end="385.55">are waiting in line because each person</span> <span data-start="385.55" data-end="388.28">before you has to order the drink and</span> <span data-start="388.28" data-end="390.26">wait for that drink right so you have</span> <span data-start="390.26" data-end="393.26">unhappy customers the line is blocked</span> <span data-start="393.26" data-end="395.78">your typical blocking input and output</span> <span data-start="395.78" data-end="401.09">system now let's take a look how things</span> <span data-start="401.09" data-end="403.76">are in no js' so we have event loop</span> <span data-start="403.76" data-end="406.4">again and event loop delegates the</span> <span data-start="406.4" data-end="409.789">processes to others underlying systems</span> <span data-start="409.789" data-end="412.529">so event loop is almost never</span> <span data-start="412.529" data-end="414.959">locked it's almost never blocked and</span> <span data-start="414.959" data-end="417.749">that's a good thing and it's also a</span> <span data-start="417.749" data-end="419.609">single-threaded we will talk about it in</span> <span data-start="419.609" data-end="422.459">the next slide but basically going back</span> <span data-start="422.459" data-end="424.739">to our coffee shop analogies this is how</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="424.739" data-end="427.799">Starbucks works and maybe Dunkin Donuts</span> <span data-start="427.799" data-end="431.359">which I've heard people like in Iceland</span> <span data-start="431.359" data-end="434.039">so people are happier they're sitting at</span> <span data-start="434.039" data-end="436.709">the tables because it's asynchronous we</span> <span data-start="436.709" data-end="438.869">have this non-blocking in input and</span> <span data-start="438.869" data-end="441.119">output system implemented so you go</span> <span data-start="441.119" data-end="443.639">order your drink they write down your</span> <span data-start="443.639" data-end="446.459">name and or maybe they give you number</span> <span data-start="446.459" data-end="448.589">and then you go back to your table and</span> <span data-start="448.589" data-end="452.219">you continue working on your JavaScript</span> <span data-start="452.219" data-end="454.739">application and they call you you go</span> <span data-start="454.739" data-end="456.839">back and get your drink right so people</span> <span data-start="456.839" data-end="459.479">are happy we don't have a line and also</span> <span data-start="459.479" data-end="462.719">this process tends to be a better at</span> <span data-start="462.719" data-end="464.879">scaling because the only way you can</span> <span data-start="464.879" data-end="467.129">actually scale the blocking system by</span> <span data-start="467.129" data-end="468.839">increasing the number of threads or</span> <span data-start="468.839" data-end="470.879">increasing the number of registers the</span> <span data-start="470.879" data-end="473.549">cash registers that will increase the</span> <span data-start="473.549" data-end="476.099">number of lines but in this example you</span> <span data-start="476.099" data-end="479.599">can increase the number of workers so</span> <span data-start="479.599" data-end="482.549">multi-threading it's not necessarily a</span> <span data-start="482.549" data-end="485.849">great thing sometimes it can blow up in</span> <span data-start="485.849" data-end="487.619">your face especially if you don't know</span> <span data-start="487.619" data-end="490.049">how to use it so it comes with</span> <span data-start="490.049" data-end="492.599">complexity and it was born out of the</span> <span data-start="492.599" data-end="495.119">necessity how you would scale a blocking</span> <span data-start="495.119" data-end="499.079">system right so the blocking system they</span> <span data-start="499.079" data-end="501.269">have to be multi-threaded in nodejs</span> <span data-start="501.269" data-end="503.879">it's a single threaded system so it</span> <span data-start="503.879" data-end="505.649">eliminates complexities such as</span> <span data-start="505.649" data-end="507.979">synchronizing the data between threads</span> <span data-start="507.979" data-end="511.949">deadlocks racing conditions etc but it's</span> <span data-start="511.949" data-end="514.169">still possible to write blocking code in</span> <span data-start="514.169" data-end="518.129">ogs so by just the knowing that no js'</span> <span data-start="518.129" data-end="521.339">is have the non blocking i/o it's still</span> <span data-start="521.339" data-end="522.959">not going to prevent developers from</span> <span data-start="522.959" data-end="526.259">writing blocking code let's take a look</span> <span data-start="526.259" data-end="529.17">at this example and you can run there is</span> <span data-start="529.17" data-end="531.99">a file blocking j/s so you can just go</span> <span data-start="531.99" data-end="533.85">into your terminal and execute that file</span> <span data-start="533.85" data-end="538.379">once you get my source code and I get</span> <span data-start="538.379" data-end="540.959">anywhere from 100 milliseconds to 1,000</span> <span data-start="540.959" data-end="544.35">milliseconds obviously most of the times</span> <span data-start="544.35" data-end="546.57">we don't get the blocking code</span> <span data-start="546.57" data-end="549.03">just obvious which is like a for-loop</span> <span data-start="549.03" data-end="552.3">this blocking code is buried inside of</span> <span data-start="552.3" data-end="555.44">the module I know that module that</span> <span data-start="555.44" data-end="559.98">that's how so the way to know that it's</span> <span data-start="559.98" data-end="561.81">a synchronous basically you need either</span> <span data-start="561.81" data-end="564.15">to read the documentation or read the</span> <span data-start="564.15" data-end="568.47">source code in this case FS the naming</span> <span data-start="568.47" data-end="569.55">convention</span> <span data-start="569.55" data-end="571.92">it has the word sink in it so we know</span> <span data-start="571.92" data-end="573.57">that it's a synchronous module by</span> <span data-start="573.57" data-end="576.42">looking at it another dead giveaway</span> <span data-start="576.42" data-end="578.01">signer that the content will be</span> <span data-start="578.01" data-end="580.23">available right there on the next line</span> <span data-start="580.23" data-end="583.23">so I can assign var and then the result</span> <span data-start="583.23" data-end="586.08">of read file sync and I can cancel log</span> <span data-start="586.08" data-end="589.05">that so we will go from top to bottom</span> <span data-start="589.05" data-end="592.8">just as in any other traditional</span> <span data-start="592.8" data-end="595.35">programming language in a synchronous</span> <span data-start="595.35" data-end="597.3">language so it's very easy to reason</span> <span data-start="597.3" data-end="599.82">about but this would not be very</span> <span data-start="599.82" data-end="602.34">efficient code this is much more</span> <span data-start="602.34" data-end="605.55">efficient code it's also in node.js but</span> <span data-start="605.55" data-end="609.57">now we're using a function which is read</span> <span data-start="609.57" data-end="612.45">file not read file sync and with this</span> <span data-start="612.45" data-end="615.42">file we're using callbacks so the trick</span> <span data-start="615.42" data-end="617.25">here is that the data would not be</span> <span data-start="617.25"
