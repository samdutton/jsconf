<p><span data-start="74.4" data-end="82.5">James Caan I put out this site html5</span> <span data-start="82.5" data-end="84.53">readiness and the main idea here is that</span> <span data-start="84.53" data-end="87.21">we're not dealing with waiting for html5</span> <span data-start="87.21" data-end="89.22">to be ready we're waiting for features</span> <span data-start="89.22" data-end="90.84">with inside html5 to be ready all these</span> <span data-start="90.84" data-end="93.119">features are implemented incrementally</span> <span data-start="93.119" data-end="96.329">across browsers so think of it that way</span> <span data-start="96.329" data-end="99.03">instead of you know what are the big</span> <span data-start="99.03" data-end="102.06">things so for instance like at font-face</span> <span data-start="102.06" data-end="107.31">in css3 has had support in ie6 578</span> <span data-start="107.31" data-end="110.82">everything something like drag-and-drop</span> <span

data-end="120.899">that doesn't really have great support</span> <span data-start="120.899" data-end="126.78">yet so yeah but if we take a look at all</span> <span data-start="126.78" data-end="129.929">of all of the html5 features kind of</span> <span data-start="129.929" data-end="133.79">what how can we break these up so I</span> <span data-start="133.79" data-end="135.93">think we can break them up like this so</span> <span data-start="135.93" data-end="138.48">here we have dependable features and</span> <span data-start="138.48" data-end="139.53">these are the things that

data-end="416.85">there's not going to be support so it's</span> <span data-start="416.85" data-end="419.76">pretty pretty damn beautiful how this</span> <span data-start="419.76" data-end="422.46">works right so video for everyone back</span> <span data-start="422.46" data-end="423.78">rock came and kind of popularized this</span> <span data-start="423.78" data-end="426.63">technique we have the video tag the</span> <span data-start="426.63" data-end="427.89">source attribute is calling out are</span> <span data-start="427.89" data-end="429.3">three

now fixed but</span> <span data-start="435.48" data-end="438.33">keep it first for now and then anyways</span> <span data-start="438.33" data-end="441.27">we we throw a flash object in there any</span> <span data-start="441.27" data-end="442.98">non supporting browser kind of ignores</span> <span data-start="442.98" data-end="445.32">the video tags or source tags and then</span> <span data-start="445.32" data-end="448.65">just dives right for that i will point</span> <span data-start="448.65" data-end="452.16">out of course though if let's say that</span> <span data-start="452.16" data-end="458.39">you like you only want to serve mp4 s if</span> <span data-start="458.39" data-end="460.89">you do this technique and you only</span> <span data-start="460.89" data-end="463.26">include the mp4 firefox for instance</span> <span data-start="463.26" data-end="465.74">which doesn't support that codec will</span> <span data-start="465.74" data-end="468.03">try and use the video tag it won't be</span> <span data-start="468.03" data-end="469.53">like Oh use the video tag but then I</span> <span data-start="469.53" data-end="470.97">can't use that code XO then I'll fall</span> <span data-start="470.97" data-end="473.46">back to the flash doesn't do that so you</span> <span data-start="473.46" data-end="475.02">actually have to use JavaScript and use</span> <span data-start="475.02" data-end="477.24">the can play type method to see can I</span> <span data-start="477.24" data-end="479.66">use this codec in this browser if not</span> <span data-start="479.66" data-end="481.25">then I'll just switch everything in for</span> <span data-start="481.25" data-end="484.07">the flash object but in general and this</span> <span data-start="484.07" data-end="486.23">sort of technique you get a get a good</span> <span data-start="486.23" data-end="494.21">amount of coverage yeah okay canvas</span> <span data-start="494.21" data-end="497.42">we've had X canvas from Eric Cartman's</span> <span data-start="497.42" data-end="499.31">in Google for a long time bringing</span> <span data-start="499.31"

<span data-start="523.76" data-end="525.92">was fun so I like kind of tweaked it and</span> <span data-start="525.92" data-end="527.48">you can adjust the resolution make a</span> <span

data-end="1434.7">pulled together all the different</span> <span data-start="1434.7" data-end="1436.35">scripts that people have done to kind of</span> <span data-start="1436.35" data-end="1440.76">do this thing and so we have a big happy</span> <span data-start="1440.76" data-end="1443.25">list of all the we're gonna calm</span> <span data-start="1443.25" data-end="1445.53">polyfills I think Remy

data-end="1493.53">added a lot of things where we don't</span> <span data-start="1493.53" data-end="1495.99">really have support for the progress and</span> <span data-start="1495.99" data-end="1498.24">meter elements no one's really made a</span> <span data-start="1498.24" data-end="1500.91">script that kind of give support to</span> <span data-start="1500.91" data-end="1503.91">older browsers for those but I'd love to</span> <span data-start="1503.91" data-end="1507.63">get your help and kind of filling in</span> <span data-start="1507.63"

data-start="1536.15" data-end="1539.12">just do a test so modernizer indexdb</span> <span data-start="1539.12" data-end="1541.19">this is going to return either true or</span> <span
