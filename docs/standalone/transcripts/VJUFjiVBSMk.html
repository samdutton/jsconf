<p><span data-start="80.96" data-end="84.14">Oh awesome okay all right which part</span> <span data-start="84.14" data-end="86.87">should I say again I'm just kidding so</span> <span data-start="86.87" data-end="88.55">these are a research collaboration</span> <span data-start="88.55" data-end="90.53">platform where we allow people to upload</span> <span data-start="90.53" data-end="92.69">data or share here back make</span> <span data-start="92.69" data-end="94.25">visualizations and v3 and stuff like</span> <span data-start="94.25" data-end="96.59">that so you can kind of see how a data</span> <span data-start="96.59" data-end="98.39">evolved from the beginning so goes from</span> <span data-start="98.39" data-end="100.7">raw data set to being prepared to being</span> <span data-start="100.7" data-end="102.23">analyzed to being visualized and then</span> <span data-start="102.23" data-end="103.909">share back what you found and the whole</span> <span data-start="103.909" data-end="105.95">idea was are people gonna get the same</span> <span data-start="105.95" data-end="107.78">results if they use one of the same</span> <span data-start="107.78" data-end="109.76">analysis platforms they use the same</span> <span data-start="109.76" data-end="111.95">methods and what's gonna be the</span> <span data-start="111.95" data-end="115.159">difference at the end right and so the</span> <span data-start="115.159" data-end="116.87">whole reason we kind of started was the</span> <span data-start="116.87" data-end="118.67">whole research process now was</span> <span data-start="118.67" data-end="119.84">completely messed up</span> <span data-start="119.84" data-end="122.11">all right especially because it's very</span> <span data-start="122.11" data-end="124.72">old-school I'd say for us a little bit</span> <span data-start="124.72" data-end="127.97">so you you do your analysis young you do</span> <span data-start="127.97" data-end="130.31">you view your data collection you</span> <span data-start="130.31" data-end="131.9">analyze it whatever from a network</span> <span data-start="131.9" data-end="133.67">analyzer or whatever it is and I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="133.67" data-end="136.01">be really physics specific here just cuz</span> <span data-start="136.01" data-end="137.39">that's what I know</span> <span data-start="137.39" data-end="139.25">you do that and then you analyze li</span> <span data-start="139.25" data-end="140.72">visualize them and you send it to your</span> <span data-start="140.72" data-end="142.58">advising professor or whoever it is your</span> <span data-start="142.58" data-end="144.71">team their an email and you upload it to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="144.71" data-end="147.35">Dropbox and then at the end you finally</span> <span data-start="147.35" data-end="148.94">share it then in the middle you've</span> <span data-start="148.94" data-end="151.19">completely lost a lot of things all the</span> <span data-start="151.19" data-end="152.63">context you know how you went from point</span> <span data-start="152.63" data-end="155.54">A to point B what methods you use unless</span> <span data-start="155.54" data-end="157.04">you specifically specify that and</span> <span data-start="157.04" data-end="159.41">whatever you're sending right and so we</span> <span data-start="159.41" data-end="160.97">said okay let's make this very simple</span> <span data-start="160.97" data-end="163.7">you upload your data through either API</span> <span data-start="163.7" data-end="165.86">or interface and then you you</span> <span data-start="165.86" data-end="167.209">collaborate the site where you're gonna</span> <span data-start="167.209" data-end="168.95">add a lighter and why not and then you</span> <span data-start="168.95" data-end="172.07">analyze it using whatever it is showing</span> <span data-start="172.07" data-end="173.42">all the steps that you're taking and</span> <span data-start="173.42" data-end="176">then finally share it and if somebody</span> <span data-start="176" data-end="177.68">else sees that if somebody comes in the</span> <span data-start="177.68" data-end="178.79">middle of the research project they can</span> <span data-start="178.79" data-end="180.35">see exactly where you left off where</span> <span data-start="180.35" data-end="182.36">you've done to get to that step right so</span> <span data-start="182.36" data-end="185.48">you wanted everything to be in line all</span> <span data-start="185.48" data-end="188.33">right enough about that and then at the</span> <span data-start="188.33" data-end="190.58">end for us was if somebody used the</span> <span data-start="190.58" data-end="191.93">statement let's say for example somebody</span> <span data-start="191.93" data-end="193.91">use temperature data from NASA to you</span> <span data-start="193.91" data-end="195.53">know work on global warming especially</span> <span data-start="195.53" data-end="196.52">wanted the projects were working on</span> <span data-start="196.52" data-end="198.83">somebody else uses it for economics and</span> <span data-start="198.83" data-end="200.209">somebody else use it for healthcare</span> <span data-start="200.209" data-end="201.95">somebody else use it for whatever we</span> <span data-start="201.95" data-end="203.36">wanted to see how these different topics</span> <span data-start="203.36" data-end="205.07">related to each other it's really</span> <span data-start="205.07" data-end="206.6">interesting you can see some topics are</span> <span data-start="206.6" data-end="209.18">closer than you think even if you did</span> <span data-start="209.18" data-end="210.89">not see look at the data right economics</span> <span data-start="210.89" data-end="212.299">might be really close to physics or do</span> <span data-start="212.299" data-end="216.019">whatever if you guys go to here you can</span> <span data-start="216.019" data-end="217.88">guys can see all the data you don't have</span> <span data-start="217.88" data-end="220.97">to sign up you just get that okay so d3</span> <span data-start="220.97" data-end="223.459">the reason we started with d3 was people</span> <span data-start="223.459" data-end="226.1">who when people were uploading data they</span> <span data-start="226.1" data-end="227.69">were leaving the platform a lot of the</span> <span data-start="227.69" data-end="229.579">times just to analyze this data and then</span> <span data-start="229.579" data-end="230.989">they would come back and it was lose a</span> <span data-start="230.989" data-end="233.239">lot of stuff in between so he said ok</span> <span data-start="233.239" data-end="235.28">what would it take to let people analyze</span> <span data-start="235.28" data-end="237.769">data on our platform obviously the</span> <span data-start="237.769" data-end="239.54">obvious answer first was Jupiter right</span> <span data-start="239.54" data-end="240.95">you could have notebooks Python in art</span> <span data-start="240.95" data-end="243.38">but we said ok how about we use Java</span> <span data-start="243.38" data-end="245.12">scripts that can kind of give us a kick</span> <span data-start="245.12" data-end="246.41">and everybody knows JavaScript that's</span> <span data-start="246.41" data-end="248.42">really you know out there and d3 is</span> <span data-start="248.42" data-end="250.79">really awesome so we said ok let's do</span> <span data-start="250.79" data-end="254">that let's work on JavaScript but the</span> <span data-start="254" data-end="259.21">problem right</span> <span data-start="259.22" data-end="263.15">the problem was a lot of these d3 and</span> <span data-start="263.15" data-end="265.01">announces that were being made were kind</span> <span data-start="265.01" data-end="266.6">of one-off right people would make them</span> <span data-start="266.6" data-end="268.79">right hundred lines of code if you</span> <span data-start="268.79" data-end="270.17">wanted to use that same thing for your</span> <span data-start="270.17" data-end="271.79">own analysis it would not work right</span> <span data-start="271.79" data-end="274.58">it's very very project specific so we</span> <span data-start="274.58" data-end="276.17">said how about we obstruct it a little</span> <span data-start="276.17" data-end="277.73">bit and let people use each other's code</span> <span data-start="277.73" data-end="281.54">right and there was this wonderful thing</span> <span data-start="281.54" data-end="284.15">right we create our own programming</span> <span data-start="284.15" data-end="285.83">language and we say okay we're gonna let</span> <span data-start="285.83" data-end="287.5">people abstract</span> <span data-start="287.5" data-end="290.21">d3 modules and then we're gonna let</span> <span data-start="290.21" data-end="291.62">other people call those modules and</span> <span data-start="291.62" data-end="292.79">match it with whatever data they're</span> <span data-start="292.79" data-end="295.67">doing right so he said people will be</span> <span data-start="295.67" data-end="297.32">able to write you know point plot</span> <span data-start="297.32" data-end="298.7">function and then you will get somebody</span> <span data-start="298.7" data-end="300.59">else's data on the platform and then you</span> <span data-start="300.59" data-end="302.33">can plot that in real time while you're</span> <span data-start="302.33" data-end="304.19">on the platform so our whole thing was</span> <span data-start="304.19" data-end="305.72">people should not be leaving our</span> <span data-start="305.72" data-end="309.07">platform to do whatever they were doing</span> <span data-start="309.07" data-end="311.18">so this is kind of what looked like he</span> <span data-start="311.18" data-end="312.71">would this is a kind of a mix we have</span> <span data-start="312.71" data-end="313.7">structured it a little bit in the</span> <span data-start="313.7" data-end="315.11">beginning as well it's kind of a mix of</span> <span data-start="315.11" data-end="318.32">raw JavaScript and d3 so people would</span> <span data-start="318.32" data-end="320.54">make this this module they would write</span> <span data-start="320.54" data-end="322.67">it on the on our platform using d3 which</span> <span data-start="322.67" data-end="324.29">is already included as a library and</span> <span data-start="324.29" data-end="326.72">then you can even test it as a test file</span> <span data-start="326.72" data-end="329.42">here and then somebody would call that</span> <span data-start="329.42" data-end="332.12">function from our from our platform</span> <span data-start="332.12" data-end="334.54">right you know zoom in here a little bit</span> <span data-start="334.54" data-end="337.55">for the code so our code is very very</span> <span data-start="337.55" data-end="339.08">very simple I would even call a</span> <span data-start="339.08" data-end="340.4">programming language is more kind of</span> <span data-start="340.4" data-end="341.99">like these commands you would send to</span> <span data-start="341.99" data-end="344.45">get back these outputs so you would say</span> <span data-start="344.45" data-end="346.64">okay I want I want to visualize this</span> <span data-start="346.64" data-end="349.58">data set and here is this and I want to</span> <span data-start="349.58" data-end="351.77">use this d3 code specific code if you</span> <span data-start="351.77" data-end="355.82">see there the line plot the that you</span> <span data-start="355.82" data-end="358.88">mean the the line plot function I would</span> <span data-start="358.88" data-end="360.35">say okay my user name and then the line</span> <span data-start="360.35" data-end="362.3">plot function and then that would plot</span> <span data-start="362.3" data-end="365.66">me whatever this is right this is just a</span> <span data-start="365.66" data-end="368.51">random numbers being visualized so we</span> <span data-start="368.51" data-end="369.77">got a little bit more complex people</span> <span data-start="369.77" data-end="371.66">were building these modules and then you</span> <span data-start="371.66" data-end="374">would call them and then the biggest</span> <span data-start="374" data-end="375.5">problem came people had to learn how to</span> <span data-start="375.5" data-end="378.08">write a new language and people had had</span> <span data-start="378.08" data-end="380.39">to know how to make d3 modules and so</span> <span data-start="380.39" data-end="383.42">this was a complete failure right people</span> <span data-start="383.42" data-end="384.8">were not making this need to not want to</span> <span data-start="384.8" data-end="387.05">learn a new language there was they said</span> <span data-start="387.05" data-end="388.34">okay why not use our why not use</span> <span data-start="388.34" data-end="388.95">mathematic</span> <span data-start="388.95" data-end="391.14">why not using that lab we just wanted</span> <span data-start="391.14" data-end="395.79">people to stay but they would and so</span> <span data-start="395.79" data-end="397.86">what what we did now was we said okay</span> <span data-start="397.86" data-end="399.45">that did not work so how can we still</span> <span data-start="399.45" data-end="402.48">let people use JavaScript and still be</span> <span data-start="402.48" data-end="405.12">able to plot data on our platform all</span> <span data-start="405.12" data-end="409.41">right and so we went more into into</span> <span data-start="409.41" data-end="411.18">templates instead of using our own</span> <span data-start="411.18" data-end="412.77">language so let's say for example you</span> <span data-start="412.77" data-end="415.11">take this raw data set this is like this</span> <span data-start="415.11" data-end="418.73">is a temperature data we got from NASA</span> <span data-start="418.73" data-end="422.07">here's the expanded view and then we</span> <span data-start="422.07" data-end="423.69">said okay even if it's horrible let's</span> <span data-start="423.69" data-end="425.84">just let people write lines of code to</span> <span data-start="425.84" data-end="428.42">analyze this data set so here's that</span> <span data-start="428.42" data-end="430.98">just to plot this function this this</span> <span data-start="430.98" data-end="433.44">data all right that's just one month you</span> <span data-start="433.44" data-end="435.12">would have to write all of that just to</span> <span data-start="435.12" data-end="437.16">do one thing if we did it in our own</span> <span data-start="437.16" data-end="438.48">programming language all of that would</span> <span data-start="438.48" data-end="439.83">be extracted for you only thing you to</span> <span data-start="439.83" data-end="441.18">do is just give it that pointer that a</span> <span data-start="441.18" data-end="442.56">file and then you just plot it</span> <span data-start="442.56" data-end="444.51">automatically right but that didn't work</span> <span data-start="444.51" data-end="446.55">still people did not want to learn in</span> <span data-start="446.55" data-end="451.77">language here's another one here's a</span> <span data-start="451.77" data-end="454.17">he's another templated function here</span> <span data-start="454.17" data-end="456.57">this is plotting each month of the same</span> <span data-start="456.57" data-end="458.82">data set and this is kind of where we</span> <span data-start="458.82" data-end="460.05">want to go at the end of the day is</span> <span data-start="460.05" data-end="461.76">people are not leaving the platform that</span> <span data-start="461.76" data-end="463.23">you're just doing it in real time on the</span> <span data-start="463.23" data-end="464.25">platform right there right without</span> <span data-start="464.25" data-end="465.63">having to leave anything and then you're</span> <span data-start="465.63" data-end="466.89">still at the same time showing people</span> <span data-start="466.89" data-end="467.64">how you did it</span> <span data-start="467.64" data-end="469.47">people can see you see your source code</span> <span data-start="469.47" data-end="471">they can see what data point you use you</span> <span data-start="471" data-end="473.07">can see how you analyze that because a</span> <span data-start="473.07" data-end="474.75">lot of the times when you're doing</span> <span data-start="474.75" data-end="477.54">especially computational stuff you want</span> <span data-start="477.54" data-end="479.13">to see under the hood of that</span> <span data-start="479.13" data-end="481.26">mathematical function all right what is</span> <span data-start="481.26" data-end="483">that actually doing does that differ</span> <span data-start="483" data-end="484.56">from platform to platform right</span> <span data-start="484.56" data-end="485.88">especially when you get to higher</span> <span data-start="485.88" data-end="487.59">numbers if you want to get more accurate</span> <span data-start="487.59" data-end="489.72">to what extent is that approximating and</span> <span data-start="489.72" data-end="492.24">stuff like that to it so our our whole</span> <span data-start="492.24" data-end="495.15">vision is can people because people can</span> <span data-start="495.15" data-end="496.35">see more and more of the code they can</span> <span data-start="496.35" data-end="497.52">see under the hood they can see under</span> <span data-start="497.52" data-end="499.56">the hood of the functions would it be</span> <span data-start="499.56" data-end="500.88">better for the whole community right it</span> <span data-start="500.88" data-end="502.47">will be better if you can see for how I</span> <span data-start="502.47" data-end="505.98">got from point A to point B and there's</span> <span data-start="505.98" data-end="507.45">a lot there's a huge culture of just</span> <span data-start="507.45" data-end="509.04">showing the end results and not showing</span> <span data-start="509.04" data-end="511.26">what you've done before so we kind of</span> <span data-start="511.26" data-end="512.52">wanted to get rid of that it's a huge</span> <span data-start="512.52" data-end="514.14">huge problem and we're not gonna be able</span> <span data-start="514.14" data-end="516.21">to fix anytime soon but we think this is</span> <span data-start="516.21" data-end="519.839">a good start</span> <span data-start="519.849" data-end="521.9">here's another one and so when you save</span> <span data-start="521.9" data-end="523.82">these files you can see you can see</span> <span data-start="523.82" data-end="525.05">exactly how somebody did it and they're</span> <span data-start="525.05" data-end="526.43">saved just like any other file you can</span> <span data-start="526.43" data-end="528.26">download this file just like any other</span> <span data-start="528.26" data-end="535.22">file you would in a platform and so</span> <span data-start="535.22" data-end="537.55">here's another one so a few weeks ago</span> <span data-start="537.55" data-end="540.41">somebody was a few weeks a few months</span> <span data-start="540.41" data-end="542.72">ago actually somebody uploaded where</span> <span data-start="542.72" data-end="544.97">every meteorite has hit in the world</span> <span data-start="544.97" data-end="548.18">since like the 1700s we got that data we</span> <span data-start="548.18" data-end="550.58">plotted it using d3 and this is kind of</span> <span data-start="550.58" data-end="552.65">what we want happening on a bigger scale</span> <span data-start="552.65" data-end="554.78">right I upload some things everybody</span> <span data-start="554.78" data-end="556.16">else goes on the platform to analyze</span> <span data-start="556.16" data-end="557.57">something and then we would get back</span> <span data-start="557.57" data-end="559.4">results can we match this with something</span> <span data-start="559.4" data-end="563.36">else and can we predict stuff can we can</span> <span data-start="563.36" data-end="564.53">we see that how this has affected</span> <span data-start="564.53" data-end="566.39">something else right this is kind of the</span> <span data-start="566.39" data-end="567.97">bigger picture of our of our whole thing</span> <span data-start="567.97" data-end="571.07">but again I kept saying like we want to</span> <span data-start="571.07" data-end="572.51">go back to JavaScript that's just cuz</span> <span data-start="572.51" data-end="574.07">everybody knows it and it's more</span> <span data-start="574.07" data-end="576.38">comfortable to write in I think at least</span> <span data-start="576.38" data-end="578.36">we will be supporting Jupiter just</span> <span data-start="578.36" data-end="580.01">because it's a really high demand right</span> <span data-start="580.01" data-end="583.31">now for us and our as well and be</span> <span data-start="583.31" data-end="584.78">writing SDKs for all these other</span> <span data-start="584.78" data-end="587.18">languages but there's another example of</span> <span data-start="587.18" data-end="589.49">using d3 and all this is open source</span> <span data-start="589.49" data-end="591.08">open and open source you guys can go</span> <span data-start="591.08" data-end="593.78">check it out so next we'll be</span> <span data-start="593.78" data-end="596.9">integrating mass J is probably one of</span> <span data-start="596.9" data-end="600.53">the craters here mats JSON d3 so we want</span> <span data-start="600.53" data-end="601.88">to not only just visualize because</span> <span data-start="601.88" data-end="603.95">visualizations are just literally the</span> <span data-start="603.95" data-end="605.96">end of what you do in a research process</span> <span data-start="605.96" data-end="608.03">you have to do all the computation all</span> <span data-start="608.03" data-end="610.01">the analysis all the cleaning so we kind</span> <span data-start="610.01" data-end="611.39">of want to integrate that expand it a</span> <span data-start="611.39" data-end="613.61">little bit and see if we can do a lot of</span> <span data-start="613.61" data-end="615.44">the computational stuff also before we</span> <span data-start="615.44" data-end="621.29">get to the visualizations</span> <span data-start="621.3" data-end="623.88">that's it and here's my contact</span> <span data-start="623.88" data-end="626.22">information if you guys want I'll open</span> <span data-start="626.22" data-end="627.45">up for questions in a little bit and</span> <span data-start="627.45" data-end="630.12">talk a little bit more but so far is</span> <span data-start="630.12" data-end="643.41">there any questions no animation yeah I</span> <span data-start="643.41" data-end="646.23">mean do you know if we support it yeah I</span> <span data-start="646.23" data-end="647.76">mean anything you write so actually</span> <span data-start="647.76" data-end="650.58">didn't show up as PDF what anything</span> <span data-start="650.58" data-end="651.96">you're right here will be displayed if</span> <span data-start="651.96" data-end="653.55">it's animation or whatever it is</span> <span data-start="653.55" data-end="654.87">yeah we'll display everything at some</span> <span data-start="654.87" data-end="655.92">point we're gonna have to start checking</span> <span data-start="655.92" data-end="658.47">what kind of code it is just cuz it's a</span> <span data-start="658.47" data-end="660.27">little disruptive sometimes what yeah</span> <span data-start="660.27" data-end="662.28">anything is supported as long as your</span> <span data-start="662.28" data-end="669.35">browser handles it yeah oh</span> <span data-start="669.36" data-end="687.71">the signup URL</span> <span data-start="687.72" data-end="697.66">there's any question yeah interesting</span> <span data-start="697.66" data-end="702.49">so whenever we release a data set the</span> <span data-start="702.49" data-end="703.69">most common thing we see is just people</span> <span data-start="703.69" data-end="705.49">analyzing a data differently using</span> <span data-start="705.49" data-end="707.5">different platforms so we usually see</span> <span

<p><span data-start="709.33" data-end="711.64">Python usually they look like the same</span> <span data-start="711.64" data-end="712.15">results</span> <span data-start="712.15" data-end="715.14">so just people using different platforms</span> <span data-start="715.14" data-end="717.4">there's also animations and stuff like</span> <span data-start="717.4" data-end="720.04">that we've just kicked this off about</span> <span data-start="720.04" data-end="723.31">three two months ago so we haven't seen</span> <span data-start="723.31" data-end="726.16">that much but it's pretty good we all</span> <span data-start="726.16" data-end="727.96">like we haven't pushed out a lot of data</span> <span data-start="727.96" data-end="729.88">a lot of the data we have is so we have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="729.88" data-end="732.55">Olympics data all the data from NASA</span> <span data-start="732.55" data-end="734.86">city of Cincinnati Ohio and stuff like</span> <span data-start="734.86" data-end="738">that we haven't we haven't come here yet</span> <span data-start="738" data-end="758.68">we will most all of the ten secrets to</span> <span data-start="758.68" data-end="760.99">writing perfect code that I'm gonna tell</span> <span data-start="760.99" data-end="762.94">you tonight have previously been covered</span> <span data-start="762.94" data-end="768.78">@j SLA so here we go number one practice</span> <span data-start="768.78" data-end="772.21">practice practice practice just like</span> <span data-start="772.21" data-end="773.8">everything else in life that's</span> <span data-start="773.8" data-end="776.5">challenging and rewarding you need to</span> <span data-start="776.5" data-end="779.08">practice so you can practice with online</span> <span data-start="779.08" data-end="781.69">tools like node school or you can attend</span> <span data-start="781.69" data-end="783.67">to the upcoming node school or you can</span> <span data-start="783.67" data-end="785.83">do things like hacker ring you can also</span> </p>
