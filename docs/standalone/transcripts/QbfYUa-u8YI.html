data-end="1373.21">some programmed hardware is still a</span> <span data-start="1373.21" data-end="1377.68">robot but to me the coolest robots are</span> <span data-start="1377.68" data-end="1379.36">ones that make interesting decisions by</span> <span data-start="1379.36" data-end="1381.58">themselves given certain types of input</span> </p>
