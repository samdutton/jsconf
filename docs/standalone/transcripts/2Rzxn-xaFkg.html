data-end="330.37">calculated models because ampersand is</span> <span data-start="330.37" data-end="332.98">really modular each piece is made of</span> <span data-start="332.98" data-end="335.59">something else like a only ampersand</span> <span data-start="335.59" data-end="338.14">state and others on the router our state</span> <span data-start="338.14" data-end="341.2">level modules so here models are just</span> <span data-start="341.2" data-end="343.09">mix of ampersand state and ampersand</span> <span data-start="343.09" data-end="347.02">sink

on</span> <span data-start="352.83" data-end="355.3">collections there are a few few types of</span> <span data-start="355.3" data-end="356.89">collections we're in Backman forget we</span> <span data-start="356.89" data-end="359.2">had only one you know we had a few of</span> <span data-start="359.2" data-end="362.05">them first one is simple ampersand</span> <span data-start="362.05" data-end="365.05">collection it does nothing only stores</span> <span data-start="365.05" data-end="367.12">your models you know you know in one</span> <span data-start="367.12" data-end="370.9">group and only it also has a fuse</span> <span data-start="370.9" data-end="373.9">fefe other things like state as you said</span> <span data-start="373.9" data-end="375.79">because understand safety space for</span> <span data-start="375.79" data-end="377.89">everything so you can listen for changes</span> <span data-start="377.89" data-end="380.56">of everything on everything it's just up</span> <span data-start="380.56" data-end="382.54">to you and it also contains some</span> <span data-start="382.54" data-end="386.68">es5 metals like reduce filter map and so</span> <span data-start="386.68" data-end="391.21">on because ampersand is only a 9 higher</span> <span data-start="391.21" data-end="394.9">so you can use all s 5 metals so your</span> <span data-start="394.9" data-end="397.479">honor you go about this and other than</span> <span data-start="397.479" data-end="399.76">this ampersand collection only those</span> <span data-start="399.76" data-end="401.61">only some doesn't have anything</span> <span data-start="401.61" data-end="405.4">ampersand collection is made of amber</span> <span data-start="405.4" data-end="406.75">some collection is a collection sorry</span> <span data-start="406.75" data-end="408.789">ampersand collection itself and there is</span> <span data-start="408.789" data-end="411.4">a mixin which I will talk about with</span> <span data-start="411.4" data-end="415.15">underscore metals and you can use sub</span> <span data-start="415.15" data-end="418.81">collection for is it can create sub</span> <span data-start="418.81" data-end="421.51">collections of of previous collection</span> <span data-start="421.51" data-end="424.57">that will be automatically updated based</span> <span data-start="424.57" data-end="427.99">on your own your filters for example</span> <span data-start="427.99" data-end="431.05">here we have a base collection and on a</span> <span data-start="431.05" data-end="433.06">sub collection would favorite widgets</span> <span data-start="433.06" data-end="435.9">will see only data that contains</span> <span data-start="435.9" data-end="439.14">awesome true and comparator which is</span> <span data-start="439.14" data-end="442.24">just a way of sorting things you can add</span> <span data-start="442.24" data-end="445.349">filters remove filters choose whether to</span> <span data-start="445.349" data-end="449.169">you can also for example say that ok I</span> <span data-start="449.169" data-end="452.05">want the only models that have awesome</span> <span data-start="452.05" data-end="455.5">true but I want to listen for some other</span> <span data-start="455.5" data-end="457.539">properties and if this properties change</span> <span data-start="457.539" data-end="460.45">also update my sub collection and check</span> <span data-start="460.45" data-end="462.4">whether there's something here or or</span> <span data-start="462.4" data-end="465.64">maybe we should remove something animal</span> <span data-start="465.64" data-end="467.349">last one is impersonal Earth collection</span> <span data-start="467.349" data-end="471.01">which is a huge mixing of ampersand</span> <span data-start="471.01" data-end="473.229">collection and personalized mixing which</span> <span data-start="473.229" data-end="476.789">is which are just methods for</span> <span data-start="476.789" data-end="479.229">persisting here your data on server and</span> <span data-start="479.229" data-end="481.51">working with the API and the underscore</span> <span data-start="481.51" data-end="484">mixing switch gives you all the</span> <span data-start="484" data-end="488.62">abilities of underscore itself if used</span> <span data-start="488.62" data-end="490.75">there plenty of use there is not only</span> <span data-start="490.75" data-end="494.14">one like people are you see so ampersand</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="494.14" data-end="497.71">V is mix of ampersand state Dom bindings</span> <span data-start="497.71" data-end="499.479">and collection view collection is used</span> <span data-start="499.479" data-end="502.78">here only because we wanted to let</span> <span data-start="502.78" data-end="504.55">people render collections which is</span> <span data-start="504.55" data-end="507.01">really like a common come on task</span> <span data-start="507.01" data-end="509.44">without any of any other radishes and</span> <span data-start="509.44" data-end="513.87">the bindings are the way that you can</span> <span data-start="513.87" data-end="516.849">tell view which data from your model</span> <span data-start="516.849" data-end="519.61">should be should be used this is could</span> <span data-start="519.61" data-end="522.43">be compared to on go our bindings to a</span> <span data-start="522.43" data-end="525.31">data binding but I will explain why not</span> <span data-start="525.31" data-end="527.2">basically because it's not it's not the</span> <span data-start="527.2" data-end="530.62">way I think what worried me okay so here</span> <span data-start="530.62" data-end="532.57">is basically you give its template which</span> <span data-start="532.57" data-end="534.84">is string and it can only have</span> <span data-start="534.84" data-end="537.03">one root so one root element for for</span> <span data-start="537.03" data-end="539.46">template you can use either stringer</span> <span data-start="539.46" data-end="542.34">function but you don't have to recompile</span> <span data-start="542.34" data-end="544.98">your functions your templates or place</span> <span data-start="544.98" data-end="547.94">data in it and so on I think there are</span> <span data-start="547.94" data-end="550.95">data hooks which will be used for for</span> <span data-start="550.95" data-end="552.89">data bindings I will talk about and</span> <span data-start="552.89" data-end="555.15">include listen for example for events</span> <span data-start="555.15" data-end="558.27">and some additional thing for this view</span> <span data-start="558.27" data-end="562.92">is that can you can register a sub views</span> <span data-start="562.92" data-end="566.85">before which was a pretty calm coming</span> <span data-start="566.85" data-end="568.53">think you want if you do in for example</span> <span data-start="568.53" data-end="571.32">backbone but won't able to and</span> <span data-start="571.32" data-end="574.56">collection view is iterative wire to</span> <span data-start="574.56" data-end="576.96">create single view inside the inside the</span> <span

data-end="588.45">something like you can create a region</span> <span data-start="588.45" data-end="591.15">it's it's normal culture from mario net</span> <span data-start="591.15" data-end="593.7">exactly you can create a region which</span> <span data-start="593.7" data-end="595.53">you can use to swap views inside many</span> <span data-start="595.53" data-end="597.78">for example you can have a button with</span> <span data-start="597.78" data-end="600.36">tabs or something like this and you can</span> <span data-start="600.36" data-end="602.37">say that after I click this button let's</span> <span data-start="602.37" data-end="604.74">switch this view and place new things</span> <span data-start="604.74" data-end="607.19">inside and it will automatically</span>

data-start="613.52" data-end="616.41">it's made of ampersand you as base plus</span> <span data-start="616.41" data-end="619.2">it has just a few simple ways a few</span> <span data-start="619.2" data-end="623.94">simple functions in can specify here how</span> <span data-start="623.94" data-end="626.25">to how to hide this view how to show</span> <span data-start="626.25"

data-end="651.66">really hard and the way we try to solve</span> <span data-start="651.66" data-end="654.74">this is you can create a huge contains</span> <span data-start="654.74" data-end="658.68">all the inputs it's it doesn't really</span> <span data-start="658.68" data-end="660.36">care what inputs you'll place in there</span> <span data-start="660.36" data-end="664.64">but

over to the</span> <span data-start="670.42" data-end="672.79">server you can reach the call button and</span> <span data-start="672.79" data-end="673.449">all this stuff</span> <span data-start="673.449" data-end="677.11">it also check whether to show error</span> <span data-start="677.11" data-end="680.11">messages for you just just just like</span> <span data-start="680.11" data-end="681.97">that you don't have to specify anything</span> <span data-start="681.97" data-end="686.98">and there are a few few inputs that you</span> <span data-start="686.98"

can just add new weights of other</span> <span data-start="719.559" data-end="721.72">package for example select view which</span> <span data-start="721.72" data-end="723.91">will create select for

<span data-start="729.309" data-end="731.98">they will all just play together it's up</span> <span data-start="731.98" data-end="735.189">to you which one you choose and we are</span> <span data-start="735.189" data-end="737.589">now on view bindings this what to talk</span> <span data-start="737.589" data-end="742.269">about because this thing that it's hard</span> <span data-start="742.269" data-end="742.87">to get it right</span> <span data-start="742.87" data-end="748.959">don't — uh usually well there is a of</span> <span data-start="748.959" data-end="750.519">course that there is rocked right now</span> <span data-start="750.519" data-end="754.389">which only change the things that the</span> <span data-start="754.389" data-end="756.25">change itself it doesn't render a whole</span> <span data-start="756.25" data-end="760.12">view but what we just suffer alone is we</span> <span data-start="760.12"

data-end="777.339">and someone pointed out that this kind</span> <span data-start="777.339" data-end="780.189">of exhibition because there are various</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="780.189" data-end="782.98">Aria roles which are used as a role and</span> <span data-start="782.98" data-end="786.009">if you keep to use those roles you'll</span> <span

<span data-start="803.48" data-end="806.09">rel attribute name attribute classes is</span> <span data-start="806.09" data-end="809.06">like few a few weeks long but in the end</span> <span data-start="809.06" data-end="812.9">we came we finished with a data hook so</span> <span data-start="812.9" data-end="816.38">it's it's a way how we use this in HTML</span> <span data-start="816.38" data-end="820.94">and we have a few few bindings I think</span> <span data-start="820.94" data-end="825.35">is you can tell which things from model</span> <span data-start="825.35" data-end="828.17">to use and in which place interview</span> <span data-start="828.17" data-end="833.33">itself so text binding is using a text</span> <span data-start="833.33" data-end="835.55">from from the model itself to be placed</span> <span data-start="835.55" data-end="838.99">in the view class is using a class in</span> <span data-start="838.99" data-end="844.55">attribute attribute is

data-end="922.49">because we can use object defined</span> <span data-start="922.49" data-end="925.61">property which is from its es5 not es6</span> <span data-start="925.61" data-end="929.42">and we
