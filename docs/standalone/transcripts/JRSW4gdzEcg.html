<p><span data-start="36" data-end="40.98">Chrome extensions and so for those</span> <span data-start="40.98" data-end="43.92">things I recently discovered this</span> <span data-start="43.92" data-end="49.66">library that is not the right clicker</span> <span data-start="49.67" data-end="53.19">it's called pro bot and it's a library</span> <span data-start="53.19" data-end="55.77">for github to write these github</span> <span data-start="55.77" data-end="59.16">applications and pro bot does this by</span> <span data-start="59.16" data-end="61.59">leveraging web hooks and the k-dub api</span> <span data-start="61.59" data-end="64.799">to give you kind of the power to extend</span> <span data-start="64.799" data-end="67.939">github in a in a pretty simple way and</span> <span data-start="67.939" data-end="70.08">most instances of pro bots are</span> <span data-start="70.08" data-end="72.299">responding to events so something</span> <span data-start="72.299" data-end="74.46">happens on github Probot gets a ping</span> <span data-start="74.46" data-end="77.49">through a web hook and it might like</span> <span data-start="77.49" data-end="78.84">analyze like what should I do in this</span> <span data-start="78.84" data-end="80.85">situation and it will maybe fire off</span> <span data-start="80.85" data-end="83.189">some events of its own and we can</span> <span data-start="83.189" data-end="84.84">actually take I have a little trivial</span> <span data-start="84.84" data-end="87.39">example and let's say if we want to</span> <span data-start="87.39" data-end="89.4">respond to every issue that's opened in</span> <span data-start="89.4" data-end="92.159">a repository and like let's just like</span> <span data-start="92.159" data-end="93.36">say hello just give them a little</span> <span data-start="93.36" data-end="96.75">welcoming message all right we're gonna</span> <span data-start="96.75" data-end="98.46">build it right now so we have this</span> <span data-start="98.46" data-end="100.909">module and it just takes in robot as</span> <span data-start="100.909" data-end="105.18">argument or a parameter and so we can</span> <span data-start="105.18" data-end="109.049">attach event listeners on the robot and</span> <span data-start="109.049" data-end="110.36">there's a list on the github</span> <span

data-end="123.32">it and so with this context we can</span> <span data-start="123.32" data-end="125.759">create a comment this is kind of</span> <span data-start="125.759" data-end="127.29">confusing I didn't really understand</span> <span data-start="127.29" data-end="128.7">this at first but this is essentially</span> <span data-start="128.7" data-end="131.54">just gives you like an object back that</span> <span data-start="131.54" data-end="133.67">operates in the context of the</span> <span data-start="133.67" data-end="135.8">issue and we just give it the body</span> <span

data-start="142.04" data-end="144.11">it's pretty it's fairly simple we just</span> <span data-start="144.11" data-end="150.25">say create this comment and that's it</span> <span data-start="150.25" data-end="152.81">it's pretty easy like we can run this</span> <span data-start="152.81" data-end="154.88">and every time somebody opens up an</span> <span data-start="154.88" data-end="157.07">issue
