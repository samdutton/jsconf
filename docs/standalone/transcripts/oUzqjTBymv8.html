9001</span> <span data-start="1011.56" data-end="1014.95">what this allows here we go is for you</span> <span data-start="1014.95" data-end="1017.23">to post arbitrary HTTP requests such as</span> <span data-start="1017.23" data-end="1021.04">a JSON RPC so you have this endpoint</span> <span data-start="1021.04" data-end="1022.959">that's not WebSocket based and not</span> <span

data-start="1091.35" data-end="1094.46">scale yes what was the second question</span> <span data-start="1094.46" data-end="1099.12">what is the web the protocol so it</span> <span data-start="1099.12"

data-end="1109.559">the current protocol is denote protocol</span> <span data-start="1109.559" data-end="1114.919">so if we go to sub stack denote protocol</span> <span data-start="1114.919" data-end="1118.679">so it's just a on it's a JSON RPC so if</span> <span data-start="1118.679" data-end="1120.48">you're familiar with Dino Dino tis a way</span> <span data-start="1120.48"
