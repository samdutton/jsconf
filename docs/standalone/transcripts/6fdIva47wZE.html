want</span> <span data-start="80.77" data-end="84.49">it so grab you later and so today we are</span> <span data-start="84.49" data-end="86.979">going to go through the basic SG stuff a</span> <span data-start="86.979" data-end="89.89">very very quick one then some animation</span> <span data-start="89.89" data-end="92.14">methods to see how we can enemy refugees</span> <span data-start="92.14" data-end="94.179">then we are going to go into more</span> <span data-start="94.179" data-end="97.06">complex one and then we're going to see</span> <span data-start="97.06" data-end="100.149">some cool real-world effects very</span> <span data-start="100.149" data-end="103.899">quickly let's go into the basics so why</span> <span data-start="103.899" data-end="107.109">svgs I believe in using SDGs because it</span> <span data-start="107.109" data-end="109.119">has good use good browser support</span> <span data-start="109.119" data-end="111.789">basically any browser support svcs right</span> <span data-start="111.789" data-end="114.819">now it's star level it's highly soluble</span> <span data-start="114.819" data-end="117.28">and do a lot of things with it and the</span> <span data-start="117.28" data-end="119.319">best of the best of all is scalable</span> <span data-start="119.319" data-end="121.659">meaning you can build animations for the</span> <span data-start="121.659" data-end="123.7">mobile for the desktop and beyond it's</span> <span data-start="123.7" data-end="127.84">up to you going to the basics there are</span> <span data-start="127.84" data-end="130.869">multiple ways of using SVG's for example</span> <span data-start="130.869" data-end="134.59">using it as an image tag or a CSS</span> <span data-start="134.59" data-end="137.98">background-image like this or an object</span> <span data-start="137.98" data-end="140.769">tag which i don't see many people using</span> <span data-start="140.769" data-end="144.16">it and inline SVG</span> <span data-start="144.16" data-end="148.24">and well multiple methods we're not</span> <span data-start="148.24" data-end="149.95">going to cover so much from the basics</span> <span data-start="149.95" data-end="152.74">in this talk right now so we're going to</span> <span data-start="152.74" data-end="155.35">just use inline SVG's because it's the</span> <span data-start="155.35" data-end="158.2">one that supports everything just to</span> <span data-start="158.2" data-end="161.8">make our lives easier so animations</span> <span data-start="161.8" data-end="166.15">methods they are basic skate 3 CSS sm IL</span> <span data-start="166.15" data-end="167.62">which stands for synchronized multimedia</span> <span

data-end="178.84">emissions are pretty good CSS is IE 9</span> <span data-start="178.84" data-end="180.82">plus so as long as you can use CSS</span> <span data-start="180.82" data-end="184.3">transitions animations you're fine SM al</span> <span data-start="184.3" data-end="186.04">if you are going to support IE 0 or</span> <span data-start="186.04" data-end="189.21">prime mini you well you can use it and</span> <span data-start="189.21" data-end="191.47">javascript has the best support so far</span> <span data-start="191.47" data-end="194.26">it goes way back to even I use six if</span> <span data-start="194.26" data-end="198.22">you use some like some good libraries so</span> <span data-start="198.22" data-end="200.13">the first part is hilarious talk about</span> <span data-start="200.13" data-end="203.05">translation meaning like moving disease</span> <span data-start="203.05" data-end="205.72">from left to right and rotation you see</span> <span

data-start="212.29" data-end="215.08">the SVG we are going to use this is the</span> <span data-start="215.08" data-end="220.42">square that we have cool so if i run</span> <span data-start="220.42" data-end="224.14">this you see a square hopefully yeah ask</span> <span data-start="224.14" data-end="229.6">away okay animating with CSS first of</span> <span data-start="229.6" data-end="232.39">all you want to use CSS when your</span> <span data-start="232.39" data-end="234.01">animations are simple we do have a lot</span> <span data-start="234.01" data-end="236.02">of different weird timing

to</span> <span data-start="240.1" data-end="242.709">any properties that only CSS can animate</span> <span data-start="242.709" data-end="245.14">which is most of them except for the</span> <span

data-end="254.83">target the SVG element that works very</span> <span data-start="254.83" data-end="257.02">very much like the same as HTML div</span> <span data-start="257.02" data-end="258.82">elements so we are not going to go into</span> <span data-start="258.82" data-end="261.58">that the other one is to target the</span> <span data-start="261.58" data-end="264.37">elements within the SDG itself there's</span> <span data-start="264.37" data-end="265.75">slightly more complex when it comes to</span> <span data-start="265.75"

data-end="1177.79">it the correct way around with to set</span> <span data-start="1177.79" data-end="1180.49">the stroke dash offset says so it</span> <span data-start="1180.49"

data-end="1244.6">thing is that you can start your path</span> <span data-start="1244.6" data-end="1246.97">anywhere and if you animate it however</span> <span data-start="1246.97" data-end="1249.28">you like so if i take if you take a look</span> <span data-start="1249.28" data-end="1251.59">here i started a path from the middle</span> <span data-start="1251.59" data-end="1254.71">and then roast it up and that is not</span> <span data-start="1254.71" data-end="1257.35">very doable with library site vapors</span> <span data-start="1257.35" data-end="1260.1">unless you really hack your way through</span> <span data-start="1260.1" data-end="1264.37">alright that's for a line drawing so</span> <span data-start="1264.37"

data-end="1272.56">well um this is well i got from co drops</span> <span data-start="1272.56" data-end="1274">so it's pretty cool if you don't know</span> <span data-start="1274"

data-end="1286.39">thing is that need to have a starting</span> <span data-start="1286.39" data-end="1289.21">path and the path when you click on it</span> <span data-start="1289.21" data-end="1292.09">so like the ending path the main thing</span> <span data-start="1292.09" data-end="1294.58">here is that the path the number of</span> <span data-start="1294.58" data-end="1297.28">points in the past must match all the</span> <span data-start="1297.28" data-end="1299.83">way I mean by that so if you know some</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1299.83" data-end="1302.08">SDGs you'll know that m starts for</span> <span data-start="1302.08" data-end="1304.21">stands for movie tall which is the start</span> <span

data-end="1310.84">just look at the alphabet so you know</span> <span data-start="1310.84" data-end="1312.88">how many points they are this s and</span> <span data-start="1312.88" data-end="1316.3">that's s so that's like 44 points here</span> <span data-start="1316.3" data-end="1321.82">yes MC s 1 s s and that's another s</span> <span data-start="1321.82" data-end="1324.04">somewhere here so that's four points in</span> <span data-start="1324.04" data-end="1329.26">both methods then there are two ways to</span> <span data-start="1329.26" data-end="1332.32">do this you can use G sets move SVG</span> <span data-start="1332.32" data-end="1335.56">plugin which is paid once again or you</span> <span data-start="1335.56" data-end="1336.61">can use snap</span> <span data-start="1336.61" data-end="1339.73">ji ji ji said natively doesn't allow you</span> <span data-start="1339.73" data-end="1343.42">to work with past very well oh yeah</span> <span data-start="1343.42" data-end="1344.77">there's one more way to do this and</span> <span data-start="1344.77" data-end="1347.08">that's the ISA meal but when your past</span> <span data-start="1347.08" data-end="1351.4">messes up you'll be so let's do how</span> <span data-start="1351.4" data-end="1353.62">it works right now with the morph SVG</span> <span data-start="1353.62" data-end="1358.75">plugin this is pit so right now we're</span> <span data-start="1358.75" data-end="1360.78">doing here is that we have a stat path</span> <span data-start="1360.78" data-end="1364.179">which is the circular one and the end</span> <span data-start="1364.179" data-end="1367.39">path which is the the oval one we're</span> <span data-start="1367.39" data-end="1369.73">going to set visibility to hidden so we</span> <span data-start="1369.73" data-end="1374.41">don't see the over one then we're going</span> <span data-start="1374.41" data-end="1383.44">to click on the more the button we're</span> <span data-start="1383.44" data-end="1387.1">going to set the start to the end so the</span> <span data-start="1387.1" data-end="1388.929">cool thing about morph SVG is that you</span> <span data-start="1388.929" data-end="1393.28">can set it to the IV of the path that</span> <span data-start="1393.28" data-end="1397.809">you want it to moth into so let me just</span> <span data-start="1397.809" data-end="1403.059">remove this and take a look so I do a</span> <span data-start="1403.059" data-end="1406.57">run now it will move in there and stay</span> <span data-start="1406.57" data-end="1408.61">it right there without any problems just</span> <span data-start="1408.61" data-end="1410.95">the coolest part about the morph SVG</span> <span data-start="1410.95" data-end="1414.61">plugin then now if I want to bring it</span> <span data-start="1414.61" data-end="1418.809">back then we just have to set a delay or</span> <span data-start="1418.809" data-end="1421.39">if you use time there are other methods</span> <span data-start="1421.39" data-end="1423.73">but this one is simple we can just set a</span> <span data-start="1423.73" data-end="1426.19">delay so and it bounces back after that</span> <span data-start="1426.19" data-end="1430.96">so something like this quite simple with</span> <span data-start="1430.96" data-end="1434.38">both SVG but of course some of us are</span> <span data-start="1434.38" data-end="1437.679">calling our misers like myself included</span> <span data-start="1437.679" data-end="1440.38">oh wait let me just talk about this like</span> <span data-start="1440.38" data-end="1443.14">remember I was saying that all the</span> <span data-start="1443.14" data-end="1446.23">challenges with morphing part shapes is</span> <span data-start="1446.23" data-end="1447.7">that you have to have the same number of</span> <span data-start="1447.7" data-end="1450.1">paths I'm sorry the similar points on</span> <span data-start="1450.1" data-end="1452.53">the path well the good thing about more</span> <span data-start="1452.53" data-end="1454.36">of SVG is that you can forget about that</span> <span data-start="1454.36" data-end="1456.07">and this is the only library where you</span> <span data-start="1456.07" data-end="1459.37">can do so like soco to elephant and</span> <span data-start="1459.37" data-end="1463">rhino to star and back into an elephant</span> <span data-start="1463" data-end="1466.929">and to a circle again this is there's a</span> <span data-start="1466.929" data-end="1468.94">lot of complex path especially with the</span> <span data-start="1468.94" data-end="1469.97">rhino and elephant</span> <span data-start="1469.97" data-end="1471.83">but it's simple when it comes to the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1471.83" data-end="1474.17">SoCo and the star well if you are</span> <span data-start="1474.17" data-end="1476.66">working with SVG if you are creating an</span> <span data-start="1476.66" data-end="1479.06">SVG yourself this is going to be hell a</span> <span data-start="1479.06" data-end="1481.31">lot of work but if you used rice which</span> <span data-start="1481.31" data-end="1483.05">she doesn't worry about it and they will</span> <span data-start="1483.05" data-end="1485.15">animate for you automatically so this is</span> <span data-start="1485.15" data-end="1489.62">pretty cool anyway for the if you don't</span> <span data-start="1489.62" data-end="1492.38">pay money like me so you can use snap</span> <span data-start="1492.38" data-end="1496.55">lcg which is following this link here 00</span> <span data-start="1496.55" data-end="1498.26">i have a link up there so you can click</span> <span data-start="1498.26" data-end="1501.35">on it if you want to so in this case we</span> <span data-start="1501.35" data-end="1502.93">are going to do it slightly differently</span> <span data-start="1502.93" data-end="1506.6">we're just going to have a path that is</span> <span data-start="1506.6" data-end="1509.63">the initial shape so I'm just going to</span> <span data-start="1509.63" data-end="1511.37">replace everything and remove everything</span> <span data-start="1511.37" data-end="1516.74">here all right we have to circle once</span> <span data-start="1516.74" data-end="1521.15">again then just make it simple we're</span> <span data-start="1521.15" data-end="1522.92">going to say we're going to specify the</span> <span data-start="1522.92" data-end="1525.08">start and end pop and JavaScript you can</span> <span data-start="1525.08" data-end="1527.78">make it nicer by setting it on an</span> <span data-start="1527.78" data-end="1530.95">attribute of the element if you want to</span> <span data-start="1530.95" data-end="1534.62">so we're going to initialize nap and</span> <span data-start="1534.62" data-end="1537.92">then select the path which is kind of</span> <span data-start="1537.92" data-end="1540.53">what it requires then the start and end</span> <span data-start="1540.53" data-end="1545">path night when we click on the button</span> <span data-start="1545" data-end="1547.25">for the first time we have to make the</span> <span data-start="1547.25" data-end="1550.49">oval shape so this is done by using the</span> <span data-start="1550.49" data-end="1553.97">enemy method the mena here is the easing</span> <span data-start="1553.97" data-end="1559.19">function provided by step SVG traveling</span> <span data-start="1559.19" data-end="1565.19">oh my god so the using function here is</span> <span data-start="1565.19" data-end="1567.59">provided by Nina it's kinda like ji</span> <span data-start="1567.59" data-end="1571.13">sub's easing function with us I think</span> <span data-start="1571.13" data-end="1573.8">it's not as powerful but you can't use G</span> <span data-start="1573.8" data-end="1579.02">set with as standby so he just like this</span> <span data-start="1579.02" data-end="1584.21">right now so you can do that then once</span> <span data-start="1584.21" data-end="1587.72">it's completed we can pass on a next</span> <span data-start="1587.72" data-end="1589.31">parameter which is the on complete</span> <span data-start="1589.31" data-end="1592.25">function and then we animate it back to</span> <span data-start="1592.25" data-end="1595.01">the start path so this is how we can do</span> <span data-start="1595.01" data-end="1600.899">it so I'm just going to copy it a reflex</span> <span data-start="1600.899" data-end="1606.34">okay cool now if you take a look at this</span> <span data-start="1606.34" data-end="1610.33">once again it goes by own again so the</span> <span data-start="1610.33" data-end="1613.33">the thing about stem SVG is that you</span> <span data-start="1613.33" data-end="1614.919">might think that stem SVG doesn't play</span> <span data-start="1614.919" data-end="1617.62">very well with she said that's kind of</span> <span data-start="1617.62" data-end="1620.74">true you can also call it this key self</span> <span data-start="1620.74" data-end="1622.72">has this whole thing that you can use</span> <span data-start="1622.72" data-end="1626.47">the call snap SVG animation method but</span> <span data-start="1626.47" data-end="1628.75">it's going to go one way so you can do</span> <span data-start="1628.75" data-end="1630.73">complex animations regarding that so</span> <span data-start="1630.73" data-end="1632.23">just be aware of it if you want to</span> <span data-start="1632.23" data-end="1636.46">combine the two of them then just a</span> <span data-start="1636.46" data-end="1639.07">quick summary the more thing</span> <span data-start="1639.07" data-end="1640.96">your past must has the same number of</span> <span data-start="1640.96" data-end="1643.419">points for the initial and ending path</span> <span data-start="1643.419" data-end="1647.59">unless you are using more SVG and yeah</span> <span data-start="1647.59" data-end="1655.789">with that come to the end of the talk I</span> <span data-start="1655.799" data-end="1659.169">noticed you used a lot of default</span> <span data-start="1659.169" data-end="1661.75">timings like easing out and so on is</span> <span data-start="1661.75" data-end="1663.429">that something you'd normally do or</span> <span data-start="1663.429" data-end="1665.919">would usually customize them well I</span> <span data-start="1665.919" data-end="1668.649">normally do use the default easing</span> <span data-start="1668.649" data-end="1671.769">functions because I find that it's more</span> <span

data-start="1677.59" data-end="1679.36">of the easing functions are they are</span> <span data-start="1679.36" data-end="1681.49">really pretty good so the more important</span> <span data-start="1681.49" data-end="1683.2">things is to set the delays of the</span> <span data-start="1683.2" data-end="1684.58">animation and the timings of the</span> <span data-start="1684.58"
