<p><span data-start="49.67" data-end="52.129">JavaScript parser is actually it's not</span> <span data-start="52.129" data-end="53.929">that easy to do I guess at least at</span> <span data-start="53.929" data-end="55.789">first it seemed like really difficult</span> <span data-start="55.789" data-end="58.55">but it was fun I really learned a lot</span> <span data-start="58.55" data-end="61.94">and it gave me a foundation for the tool</span> <span data-start="61.94" data-end="64.55">that i built and it's really a challenge</span> <span data-start="64.55" data-end="66.5">you know i i'd like to solve puzzles and</span> <span data-start="66.5" data-end="70.25">this was a huge one the big problem here</span> <span data-start="70.25" data-end="71.929">is regular expressions at least for me</span> <span data-start="71.929" data-end="75.97">it was when do you know when to parse a</span> <span data-start="75.97" data-end="78.34">division opposed to a regular expression</span> <span data-start="78.34" data-end="80.81">it's not it wasn't that obvious for me</span> <span data-start="80.81" data-end="82.79">it turned out later it was quite easy</span> <span data-start="82.79" data-end="87.079">but this is the main problem what do you</span> <span data-start="87.079" data-end="94.56">see here is this valid</span> <span data-start="94.56" data-end="97.03">another number that's correct it's a</span> <span data-start="97.03" data-end="99.1">it's a regular expression / regular</span> <span data-start="99.1" data-end="106.12">expression right so my first result was</span> <span data-start="106.12" data-end="108.4">a sea of G portrayed uses the grammar</span> <span data-start="108.4" data-end="112.57">it's best specified in specification it</span> <span data-start="112.57" data-end="114.73">uses that as a source so I didn't have</span> <span data-start="114.73" data-end="117.22">to bother myself with defining whether</span> <span data-start="117.22" data-end="118.69">whether I was parsing a regular</span> <span data-start="118.69" data-end="120.25">expression or not and so I kind of</span> <span data-start="120.25" data-end="123.46">cheated that way for myself it put out a</span> <span data-start="123.46" data-end="124.75">concrete parse tree which was really</span> <span data-start="124.75" data-end="127.57">cool and it's really it gives you a good</span> <span data-start="127.57" data-end="130.09">insight into the language but it was</span> <span data-start="130.09" data-end="133.66">slow it's really slow i did jquery at 46</span> <span data-start="133.66" data-end="137.89">k in about 24 seconds that's not usable</span> <span data-start="137.89" data-end="139.959">i mean it's it's cool as a you know as a</span> <span data-start="139.959" data-end="144.74">learning tool but it's useless as a</span> <span data-start="144.75" data-end="149.41">let's see the new resolution kind of</span> <span data-start="149.41" data-end="152.38">screw things up but this is like the</span> <span data-start="152.38" data-end="154.3">result that the concrete par-3 did is a</span> <span data-start="154.3" data-end="157.3">treatable so it will give you every step</span> <span data-start="157.3" data-end="161.38">that the specification would would you</span> <span data-start="161.38" data-end="163.51">know would would do if you would build</span> <span data-start="163.51" data-end="166.06">up the tree according to it but it's</span> <span data-start="166.06" data-end="167.29">used with you you don't need all that</span> <span data-start="167.29" data-end="169.33">information I mean it has for more</span> <span data-start="169.33" data-end="171.55">information i actually need so the tool</span> <span data-start="171.55" data-end="173.08">in the end is it's a nice learning</span> <span data-start="173.08" data-end="174.37">school if you want to know more about</span> <span data-start="174.37" data-end="176.62">specification but it's not useful as a</span> <span data-start="176.62" data-end="182.38">foundation to do anything at all so then</span> <span data-start="182.38" data-end="184.33">a colleague at my at my previous company</span> <span data-start="184.33" data-end="186.61">said that help told me that parsing is a</span> <span data-start="186.61" data-end="189.13">salt problem it's not actually solved</span> <span data-start="189.13" data-end="191.05">but for intentions and purposes this</span> <span data-start="191.05" data-end="193.239">purpose it was solved it you could do it</span> <span data-start="193.239" data-end="197.2">in linear time which means it must be</span> <span data-start="197.2" data-end="199.84">going much faster than my 24-second for</span> <span data-start="199.84" data-end="203.38">jquery so then at some point i changed</span> <span data-start="203.38" data-end="205.989">and i started from scratch and i wrote a</span> <span data-start="205.989" data-end="208.15">handwritten parser which just means i go</span> <span data-start="208.15" data-end="209.709">literally a character by character i</span> <span data-start="209.709" data-end="213.07">created tokenizer to build a you know to</span> <span data-start="213.07" data-end="216.61">find my my tokens my identifiers my plus</span> <span data-start="216.61" data-end="219.82">my minus whatever that's only one week</span> <span data-start="219.82" data-end="221.35">of course that was one week after i</span> <span data-start="221.35" data-end="222.55">build the other parts which took me</span> <span data-start="222.55" data-end="225.37">about a month or two but the new parts</span> <span data-start="225.37" data-end="227.02">took me about a week it doesn't use a</span> <span data-start="227.02" data-end="227.44">grammar</span> <span data-start="227.44" data-end="229.98">read all so it's it has the problem of</span> <span data-start="229.98" data-end="233.38">of doing extra it accepts it over it's</span> <span data-start="233.38" data-end="236.05">over accepting so I have a lot of more</span> <span data-start="236.05" data-end="241.45">education to catch soda partially became</span> <span data-start="241.45" data-end="244.21">the foundation for well you know its</span> <span data-start="244.21" data-end="247.78">foundation for several tools and the</span> <span data-start="247.78" data-end="249.04">tool that's the tool I'm coming two</span> <span data-start="249.04" data-end="250.24">percent right now I'm going to show you</span> <span data-start="250.24" data-end="252.52">it does what's index highlighting is I</span> <span data-start="252.52" data-end="255.67">guess pretty basic everybody has that</span> <span data-start="255.67" data-end="258.64">written nowadays it does a sort of form</span> <span data-start="258.64" data-end="260.709">of editing I you know I only did a tip</span> <span data-start="260.709" data-end="262.27">of the iceberg on in terms of editing I</span> <span data-start="262.27" data-end="264.09">you know there's code mirror there's a</span> <span data-start="264.09" data-end="267.07">cloud nine whatever they do much more</span> <span data-start="267.07" data-end="269.02">than that I only did the simple basic</span> <span data-start="269.02" data-end="270.88">stuff that I needed to work with the</span> <span data-start="270.88" data-end="273.34">application there's ferry will look up</span> <span data-start="273.34" data-end="275.83">jslint kind of messages error warnings</span> <span data-start="275.83" data-end="279.22">and what type checking it's in the</span> <span data-start="279.22" data-end="282.4">browser and like I said it's yeah that's</span> <span data-start="282.4" data-end="285.3">not so easy to do because you don't have</span> <span data-start="285.3" data-end="287.62">assumed the things that should be simple</span> <span data-start="287.62" data-end="290.14">you know stuff like carrots when does a</span> <span data-start="290.14" data-end="291.43">carrot move you'll have to pull</span> <span data-start="291.43" data-end="293.71">throughout every time it's really</span> <span data-start="293.71" data-end="295.63">annoying and well I didn't want to</span> <span data-start="295.63" data-end="299.23">bother without myself so the layout of</span> <span data-start="299.23" data-end="302.05">the application is the top is a text</span> <span data-start="302.05" data-end="304.6">area which is invisible that allows me</span> <span data-start="304.6" data-end="306.64">to you know get the copy paste for free</span> <span data-start="306.64" data-end="308.47">undo whatever I don't sleep all of it</span> <span data-start="308.47" data-end="311.37">with that I know there are also</span> <span data-start="311.37" data-end="313.75">implementations that use text areas that</span> <span data-start="313.75" data-end="315.46">are off screen and so they have to do</span> <span data-start="315.46" data-end="319.03">the pasting copy basing themselves so</span> <span data-start="319.03" data-end="320.62">the bottom is then the content layer</span> <span data-start="320.62" data-end="321.58">which actually has the syntax</span> <span data-start="321.58" data-end="322.93">highlighting it's actually what you see</span> <span data-start="322.93" data-end="325.87">and in between is a carrot layer which</span> <span data-start="325.87" data-end="327.55">simulates where the carrot would be</span> <span data-start="327.55" data-end="330.85">otherwise you'll go crazy because well I</span> <span data-start="330.85" data-end="332.2">i discovered that it's really annoying</span> <span data-start="332.2" data-end="334.51">not to have a carrot you have no no</span> <span data-start="334.51" data-end="337.27">orientation whatsoever and then below</span> <span data-start="337.27" data-end="339.669">that is a marker which you will well</span> <span data-start="339.669" data-end="343.81">will we become a parent yeah want to</span> <span data-start="343.81" data-end="347.26">help myself here another annoying part</span> <span data-start="347.26" data-end="349.93">which is not that apparent at first is</span> <span data-start="349.93" data-end="353.64">orientation of the carrot it's really</span> <span data-start="353.64" data-end="357.19">difficult to find your location your</span> <span data-start="357.19" data-end="360.19">location in terms of an editor because</span> <span data-start="360.19" data-end="360.95">you have</span> <span data-start="360.95" data-end="363.17">and these tabs they're usually you know</span> <span data-start="363.17" data-end="365.93">eight spaces or four spaces whatever but</span> <span data-start="365.93" data-end="367.37">in the browser they're always eight</span> <span data-start="367.37" data-end="369.29">spaces except it's not really the case</span> <span data-start="369.29" data-end="371.06">because if you start with a space the</span> <span data-start="371.06" data-end="372.65">remainder of the tab becomes seven</span> <span data-start="372.65" data-end="375.59">spaces and that's I don't know I had a</span> <span data-start="375.59" data-end="377.81">hard time dealing with that on top of</span> <span data-start="377.81" data-end="379.49">that you know browsers do wrapping they</span> <span data-start="379.49" data-end="381.98">do styling they do whatever if you do a</span> <span data-start="381.98" data-end="385.39">fun both found in Firefox your entire</span> <span data-start="385.39" data-end="388.4">the entire text Scrolls down like half a</span> <span data-start="388.4" data-end="390.59">pixel there's all kinds of these things</span> <span data-start="390.59" data-end="393.23">you have to take account that was really</span> <span data-start="393.23" data-end="394.43">annoying and it wasn't you know it</span> <span data-start="394.43" data-end="396.65">wasn't really part of my my application</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.65" data-end="398.54">I just wanted to create an editor but</span> <span data-start="398.54" data-end="401.33">the problem is you need to sync the text</span> <span data-start="401.33" data-end="403.25">editor on top of what you're seeing the</span> <span data-start="403.25" data-end="405.83">text that you're actually working on so</span> <span data-start="405.83" data-end="407.48">that needs to be perfect in perfect sync</span> <span data-start="407.48" data-end="411.92">and so these little nuances you know</span> <span data-start="411.92" data-end="414.61">they became apparent the code is a</span> <span data-start="414.61" data-end="417.89">various levels of insight it shows you</span> <span data-start="417.89" data-end="419.6">where you're missing you semicolons</span> <span data-start="419.6" data-end="421.82">which is something I'm not seeing in</span> <span data-start="421.82" data-end="424.16">most editors you know it some will give</span> <span data-start="424.16" data-end="425.81">you a warning like on the left hand side</span> <span data-start="425.81" data-end="427.67">but they're not explicitly telling you</span> <span data-start="427.67" data-end="431.06">where you're missing some ice when or</span> <span data-start="431.06" data-end="433.7">when or how you have used variables if</span> <span data-start="433.7" data-end="435.53">you duplicate them have you not use them</span> <span data-start="435.53" data-end="438.37">at all implicit global stuff like that</span> <span data-start="438.37" data-end="442.1">typing is that what it's it's it's an</span> <span data-start="442.1" data-end="444.44">implementation right now I have a better</span> <span data-start="444.44" data-end="447.05">idea on how to do it for next iteration</span> <span data-start="447.05" data-end="452.09">and and highlighting well I'll show you</span> <span data-start="452.09" data-end="456.47">in a few seconds it also does types of</span> <span data-start="456.47" data-end="458.33">properties so it will resolve every</span> <span data-start="458.33" data-end="460.64">whenever you have a variable and you use</span> <span data-start="460.64" data-end="462.92">a certain type of property on it it will</span> <span data-start="462.92" data-end="464.87">show you a list of properties and it has</span> <span data-start="464.87" data-end="467.06">resolved at some point so we will try to</span> <span data-start="467.06" data-end="469.67">match that it's not perfect and it</span> <span data-start="469.67" data-end="471.35">obviously has bugs and it's easy well I</span> <span data-start="471.35" data-end="475.49">can easily take that out properties have</span> <span data-start="475.49" data-end="478.25">types too so it does actually infer the</span> <span data-start="478.25" data-end="481.67">type of a property if it can it's I know</span> <span data-start="481.67" data-end="485.24">it's doing all kind of stuff out let's</span> <span data-start="485.24" data-end="490.13">see ya there are there's a few tools in</span> <span data-start="490.13" data-end="492.23">there like a mini far beautify it shows</span> <span data-start="492.23" data-end="493.82">you the entire forest or if you would</span> <span data-start="493.82" data-end="494.63">want to</span> <span data-start="494.63" data-end="497.3">and there's a problem navigator which is</span> <span data-start="497.3" data-end="501.44">a small menu so let me just get to the</span> <span data-start="501.44" data-end="505.91">meat of things this is basically the</span> <span data-start="505.91" data-end="514.729">tool which is crap alright so here you</span> <span data-start="514.729" data-end="518.599">see what's actually happening and that's</span> <span data-start="518.599" data-end="526.55">why I open unity so here you see an</span> <span data-start="526.55" data-end="529.72">variable you you get the D you</span> <span data-start="529.72" data-end="532.49">on top of it which goes on a marker</span> <span data-start="532.49" data-end="535.04">layer here's a variable that's been</span> <span data-start="535.04" data-end="538.91">double defined the error up is the ETH</span> <span data-start="538.91" data-end="540.41">lend her a message that you should</span> <span data-start="540.41" data-end="544.08">always declare your variables on top</span> <span data-start="544.09" data-end="546.38">that's the years of prior usage so</span> <span data-start="546.38" data-end="547.4">you're using it before you're actually</span> <span data-start="547.4" data-end="548.99">defining it so you get a warning for</span> <span data-start="548.99" data-end="556.01">that and a shadow is no problem and</span> <span data-start="556.01" data-end="557.42">you'll see that it actually doesn't</span> <span data-start="557.42" data-end="558.92">recognize them as being the same</span> <span data-start="558.92" data-end="564.23">variable scope look up def depth it will</span> <span data-start="564.23" data-end="566.75">tell you if you're using like a high</span> <span data-start="566.75" data-end="571.55">scope so it gets you two three four etc</span> <span data-start="571.55" data-end="574.07">up to 9 app 10 point you have a bigger</span> <span data-start="574.07" data-end="578.81">problem in I think so there's a tracking</span> <span data-start="578.81" data-end="581.12">object it will track every variable by a</span> <span data-start="581.12" data-end="584.99">generic a little globe global object and</span> <span data-start="584.99" data-end="587.36">so every time when your carrot is over</span> <span data-start="587.36" data-end="588.62">it it will highlight all the other</span> <span data-start="588.62" data-end="591.62">instances I guess not that fancy but</span> <span data-start="591.62" data-end="594.49">here's your demonstration of typing so</span> <span data-start="594.49" data-end="596.93">whenever you assign like a number or a</span> <span data-start="596.93" data-end="598.79">string it will know for sure for certain</span> <span data-start="598.79" data-end="600.59">that at that point it is in fact that's</span> <span data-start="600.59" data-end="602.63">that type I mean it must be there is no</span> <span data-start="602.63" data-end="607.25">other choice so it can infer that of</span> <span data-start="607.25" data-end="608.96">course I mean using the same variable</span> <span data-start="608.96" data-end="610.97">over so it will tell you all the types</span> <span data-start="610.97" data-end="614.45">that it encountered but at this point in</span> <span data-start="614.45" data-end="616.52">the code it must be this type there is</span> <span data-start="616.52" data-end="622.46">no other way it also does complex well</span> <span data-start="622.46" data-end="624.279">or complex</span> <span data-start="624.279" data-end="629.079">as expressions and 4 plus is a rather</span> <span data-start="629.079" data-end="631.149">complex one because it can either be a</span> <span data-start="631.149" data-end="634.629">string concatenation or a edition which</span> <span data-start="634.629" data-end="642.61">is a problem by itself let's see there</span> <span data-start="642.61" data-end="645.49">is a it does properties in properties so</span> <span data-start="645.49" data-end="650.559">you know this property has also is an</span> <span data-start="650.559" data-end="652.449">object because you're trying to use the</span> <span data-start="652.449" data-end="655.3">data on it so it's very likely to be an</span> <span data-start="655.3" data-end="657.91">object of some kind and it has the</span> <span data-start="657.91" data-end="662.529">property of object which is I guess a</span> <span data-start="662.529" data-end="666.37">silly name but let's see a pro raised</span> <span data-start="666.37" data-end="668.439">skype fusing because it's it can either</span> <span data-start="668.439" data-end="670.149">be an object or an array and it doesn't</span> <span data-start="670.149" data-end="672.37">handle that very well it will lock the</span> <span data-start="672.37" data-end="674.04">array part but it will also do the</span> <span data-start="674.04" data-end="676.259">object part because you're using the dot</span> <span data-start="676.259" data-end="681.1">here it will do constructors in a well</span> <span data-start="681.1" data-end="683.47">somewhat limited level it will if you're</span> <span data-start="683.47" data-end="686.649">using new or if you using prototype it</span> <span data-start="686.649" data-end="688.779">will show you that you're using a</span> <span data-start="688.779" data-end="690.509">constructor so it will try to do that</span> <span data-start="690.509" data-end="692.47">but that's actually what I'm working on</span> <span data-start="692.47" data-end="694.47">right now this is not that perfect yet</span> <span data-start="694.47" data-end="700.649">same thing here it's a constructor yay</span> <span data-start="700.649" data-end="705.25">it does some dead code will show you the</span> <span data-start="705.25" data-end="709.18">as call n bones sign if you dead code it</span> <span data-start="709.18" data-end="710.439">twice to determine whether you're</span> <span data-start="710.439" data-end="712.269">throwing or breaking or returning or</span> <span data-start="712.269" data-end="714.279">continuing anywhere and if you are then</span> <span data-start="714.279" data-end="715.839">the remaining code must be dead code so</span> <span data-start="715.839" data-end="718.3">it's really simple one it doesn't do</span> <span data-start="718.3" data-end="719.98">through or false yet so you know if</span> <span data-start="719.98" data-end="722.05">you're using your through literal and it</span> <span data-start="722.05" data-end="723.759">doesn't know that the remaining code</span> <span data-start="723.759" data-end="725.29">only of the other branch might be false</span> <span data-start="725.29" data-end="728.47">might not never be used so this would be</span> <span data-start="728.47" data-end="733.329">15 it wouldn't detect the fact that this</span> <span data-start="733.329" data-end="736.98">never get reached</span> <span data-start="736.99" data-end="739.28">it also handles labels which is actually</span> <span data-start="739.28" data-end="741.38">quite difficult i never knew that labels</span> <span data-start="741.38" data-end="744.08">were dead complex but you can you can</span> <span data-start="744.08" data-end="747.8">break through basically anything if as</span> <span data-start="747.8" data-end="749.42">long as you use a label you can just</span> <span data-start="749.42" data-end="751.85">break back to any statement i didn't</span> <span data-start="751.85" data-end="753.26">know that it so that that became quite</span> <span data-start="753.26" data-end="757.61">complex here's some jslint warnings i</span> <span data-start="757.61" data-end="760.28">basically copied pretty much any of them</span> <span data-start="760.28" data-end="763.01">any way i could find anyways some are</span> <span data-start="763.01" data-end="764.33">really hard to decipher because all i</span> <span data-start="764.33" data-end="767.63">had was the warning messages here you</span> <span data-start="767.63" data-end="769.7">see some errors so these are the errors</span> <span data-start="769.7" data-end="771.56">of the parser actually took and we'll</span> <span data-start="771.56" data-end="772.85">show you clearly that those who are</span> <span data-start="772.85" data-end="774.89">errors that simply can can't be parsed</span> <span data-start="774.89" data-end="778.37">by the parser and assignment to a call</span> <span data-start="778.37" data-end="781.99">for instance is obviously illegal oh</span> <span data-start="781.99" data-end="791.63">sorry I can't do right thank you so it's</span> <span data-start="791.63" data-end="797.56">basically that's that's what it is and</span> <span data-start="797.56" data-end="800.69">then over here you have a navigator is</span> <span data-start="800.69" data-end="807.53">that readable so on the right hand side</span> <span data-start="807.53" data-end="809.03">you see how many times is a certain</span> <span data-start="809.03" data-end="810.56">error or a certain type of error</span> <span data-start="810.56" data-end="812.57">occurred on the left side you can</span> <span data-start="812.57" data-end="814.27">navigate through and on top you'll see</span> <span data-start="814.27" data-end="816.68">what kind of error there might have been</span> <span data-start="816.68" data-end="820.16">there the blue circle is an indicator of</span> <span data-start="820.16" data-end="822.53">where you currently are trying to look</span> <span data-start="822.53" data-end="826.76">at so I'm try I try to make the four</span> <span data-start="826.76" data-end="830.09">errors as as you know as a semantic as</span> <span data-start="830.09" data-end="832.52">possible so no generic you're missing</span> <span data-start="832.52" data-end="834.83">this or that I whenever I see an error</span> <span data-start="834.83" data-end="838.55">and I can refine it I try to which is</span> <span data-start="838.55" data-end="840.53">it's not always that easy but you know</span> <span data-start="840.53" data-end="842.93">sometimes it really just is and djs</span> <span data-start="842.93" data-end="844.82">linds errors are just kind of cryptic</span> <span data-start="844.82" data-end="848.03">but usually it's it's kind of clear</span> <span data-start="848.03" data-end="853.1">what's what the problem might be there's</span> <span data-start="853.1" data-end="854.9">a min of fire which is really a basic</span> <span data-start="854.9" data-end="857.69">one it does does variable reduction but</span> <span data-start="857.69" data-end="860.44">not beyond that it doesn't reformat or</span> <span data-start="860.44" data-end="864.29">it doesn't reduce code when it can so it</span> <span data-start="864.29" data-end="866.33">doesn't use new expressions your code</span> <span data-start="866.33" data-end="867.68">range the same</span> <span data-start="867.68" data-end="869.21">is there it has a beautifier which</span> <span data-start="869.21" data-end="871.01">apparently it doesn't like this code so</span> <span data-start="871.01" data-end="880.69">of course a live demo as always I know</span> <span data-start="880.69" data-end="884.75">something like that you can toggle</span> <span data-start="884.75" data-end="889.64">certain certain problems or warnings or</span> <span data-start="889.64" data-end="892.07">whatever which was a been working on</span> <span data-start="892.07" data-end="894.11">that so it's not complete yet but I do</span> <span data-start="894.11" data-end="897.17">mean to make it you know as complete as</span> <span data-start="897.17" data-end="900.62">possible and you can see the parse tree</span> <span data-start="900.62" data-end="902.69">if you would want to but it's a big you</span> <span data-start="902.69" data-end="906.89">know just a big plane parse tree so</span> <span data-start="906.89" data-end="909.38">that's basically it um you can find the</span> <span data-start="909.38" data-end="914.75">tool as you and jay has a calm and you</span> <span data-start="914.75" data-end="916.79">it's actually bookmarklet and you can</span> <span data-start="916.79" data-end="918.8">drag it into your browser and then turn</span> <span data-start="918.8" data-end="920.47">basically any text area in a website</span> </p>
