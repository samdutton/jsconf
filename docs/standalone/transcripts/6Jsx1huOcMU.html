<p><span data-start="40.11" data-end="43.2">API than you know solving any other</span> <span data-start="43.2" data-end="49.379">issues so chapter 2.0 I basically giving</span> <span data-start="49.379" data-end="50.85">this talk because i was told me recently</span> <span data-start="50.85" data-end="54.449">that Rafael is stagnating no nothing no</span> <span data-start="54.449" data-end="57">development happening and I was so upset</span> <span data-start="57" data-end="58.559">about this because they're huge</span> <span data-start="58.559" data-end="60.78">development happening for last year just</span> <span data-start="60.78" data-end="63.6">happening on the 2.0 branch and it's</span> <span data-start="63.6" data-end="65.299">also looked like a small improvement is</span> <span data-start="65.299" data-end="68.25">most of the time it happens and then it</span> <span data-start="68.25" data-end="70.5">grows grows grows and I can't stop to</span> <span data-start="70.5" data-end="72.659">improving it so I going really release</span> <span data-start="72.659" data-end="75.21">it because I can't really hold it</span> <span data-start="75.21" data-end="79.29">anymore so what's new in 2.0 the first</span> <span data-start="79.29" data-end="85.07">of all the BML the Microsoft drawing</span> <span data-start="85.07" data-end="87.99">rubbish</span> <span data-start="87.99" data-end="92.7">it was completely rewritten from scratch</span> <span data-start="92.7" data-end="96">so I just take everything that was in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="96" data-end="98.97">Raphael destroyed away the problem was</span> <span data-start="98.97" data-end="101.399">that as many developers when I was</span> <span data-start="101.399" data-end="103.909">creating Raphael I look at the msdn and</span> <span data-start="103.909" data-end="107.159">to look at the other other libraries</span> <span data-start="107.159" data-end="109.289">like daughter like X can you ask how</span> <span data-start="109.289" data-end="112.5">they use a vml and obviously follow the</span> <span data-start="112.5" data-end="116.13">same path that was a big mistake they</span> <span data-start="116.13" data-end="119.009">all wrong they all did it wrong so I did</span> <span data-start="119.009" data-end="124.56">it better now so that's like an example</span> <span data-start="124.56" data-end="126.36">of a difference in BML which I was</span> <span data-start="126.36" data-end="128.58">trying to solve it called sub-pixel</span> <span data-start="128.58" data-end="130.41">rendering that you see there two squares</span> <span data-start="130.41" data-end="134.13">and the square on the right the square</span> <span data-start="134.13" data-end="136.38">on the left is this quadrille and SVG</span> <span data-start="136.38" data-end="138.66">the square on the rights of how the same</span> <span data-start="138.66" data-end="141.69">square will look on vml you probably</span> <span data-start="141.69" data-end="144.36">can't see the difference from this so</span> <span data-start="144.36" data-end="148.38">let's zoom it up so that happens because</span> <span data-start="148.38" data-end="151.41">when you specify when you when you</span> <span data-start="151.41" data-end="154.56">specify the coordinates and as integers</span> <span data-start="154.56" data-end="159.63">and when you use a you know SVG and use</span> <span data-start="159.63" data-end="163.29">one pixel stroke it actually doesn't fit</span> <span data-start="163.29" data-end="165.78">in the pixel grid and happens to be on</span> <span data-start="165.78" data-end="167.94">the edge of two pixels and get blurred</span> <span data-start="167.94" data-end="171.81">across these two pixels and we could</span> <span data-start="171.81" data-end="173.489">have a long discussion is good or bad</span> <span data-start="173.489" data-end="176.459">thing but this is how it is and in envy</span> <span data-start="176.459" data-end="179.22">ml you CSS to position elements and you</span> <span data-start="179.22" data-end="181.47">obviously use integer numbers for that</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="183.269">and that's why it's always nice and</span> <span data-start="183.269" data-end="185.88">crisp but it's not the same it's not</span> <span data-start="185.88" data-end="188.7">consistent and sometimes this difference</span> <span data-start="188.7" data-end="191.4">is really really annoying so it fixed</span> <span data-start="191.4" data-end="196.38">now in Rafael 2.0 it's pixel to pixel</span> <span data-start="196.38" data-end="199.98">exactly the same in BML and SVG because</span> <span data-start="199.98" data-end="203.22">it was rewritten again the</span> <span data-start="203.22" data-end="205.26">transformations it's not the important</span> <span data-start="205.26" data-end="209.579">part of a pretty much any drawing</span> <span data-start="209.579" data-end="212.459">process so the transformations which</span> <span data-start="212.459" data-end="213.75">originally didn't pay much attention</span> <span data-start="213.75" data-end="216.23">when it when it created the Rafah</span> <span data-start="216.23" data-end="218.69">and then I paid more attention to it and</span> <span data-start="218.69" data-end="221.239">then I decide to completely change it</span> <span data-start="221.239" data-end="224.989">the whole API or the transformations the</span> <span data-start="224.989" data-end="227.09">reason why I did it is because it's</span> <span data-start="227.09" data-end="229.31">something which is you use most of the</span> <span data-start="229.31" data-end="233.13">time if you're really doing stuff and</span> <span data-start="233.14" data-end="236.299">something which is very important so</span> <span data-start="236.299" data-end="238.4">what the transformations basically it's</span> <span data-start="238.4" data-end="241.519">like I can rotate and draw a rectangle</span> <span data-start="241.519" data-end="243.14">then I could rotate it around some point</span> <span data-start="243.14" data-end="246.17">and then I should be able to rotate it</span> <span data-start="246.17" data-end="247.67">around other point that was impossible</span> <span data-start="247.67" data-end="249.98">in Rafael before if you want to rotate</span> <span data-start="249.98" data-end="252.59">around another point you will reset the</span> <span data-start="252.59" data-end="254.9">previous transformation so now you could</span> <span data-start="254.9" data-end="257.389">rotate another around another point the</span> <span data-start="257.389" data-end="260.209">problem is a transformation then when</span> <span data-start="260.209" data-end="261.829">you apply multiple transformation they</span> <span data-start="261.829" data-end="264.41">all relative to previous one so if now I</span> <span data-start="264.41" data-end="266.18">want to say okay now translate</span> <span data-start="266.18" data-end="268.789">horizontally 100 pixels you will see</span> <span data-start="268.789" data-end="271.039">this picture because the whole</span> <span data-start="271.039" data-end="272.419">coordinate system is transformed</span> <span data-start="272.419" data-end="275.93">transformed as well which is may be</span> <span data-start="275.93" data-end="279.08">correct but not really useful so in</span> <span data-start="279.08" data-end="281.599">decide to introduce relative and</span> <span data-start="281.599" data-end="283.88">absolute transformations in Rafael so</span> <span data-start="283.88" data-end="285.77">now you could say transform relatively</span> <span data-start="285.77" data-end="287.57">and then you will see this or you could</span> <span data-start="287.57" data-end="288.95">say transform absolutely and then you</span> <span data-start="288.95" data-end="294.95">could see that I think it's important in</span> <span data-start="294.95" data-end="296.57">transformation to specify the Holy</span> <span data-start="296.57" data-end="298.61">origin of transformation especially when</span> <span data-start="298.61" data-end="301.01">you're talking about rotation scale for</span> <span data-start="301.01" data-end="303.05">example in SVG venue when you rotate you</span> <span data-start="303.05" data-end="304.729">specify the point around which your take</span> <span data-start="304.729" data-end="307.099">when you scale you don't specify the</span> <span data-start="307.099" data-end="308.75">point around which you scale because it</span> <span data-start="308.75" data-end="310.94">doesn't really sound like make sense so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.94" data-end="313.16">I'll show you if you want to scale this</span> <span data-start="313.16" data-end="315.95">reactor from around zero zero point look</span> <span data-start="315.95" data-end="318.53">like this that's how it by default does</span> <span data-start="318.53" data-end="321.349">it not really useful most of the time</span> <span data-start="321.349" data-end="323.21">you want to scale somewhere around the</span> <span data-start="323.21" data-end="325.31">middle of this of the square now maybe</span> <span data-start="325.31" data-end="327.95">maybe here maybe there you should</span> <span data-start="327.95" data-end="330.169">specify the point of scale it's actually</span> <span data-start="330.169" data-end="333.139">existing or in rockville 1.5 and i just</span> <span data-start="333.139" data-end="336.44">want to emphasize it a little bit so</span> <span data-start="336.44" data-end="338.479">original sort of API will be like that</span> <span data-start="338.479" data-end="340.94">right she rotates about some point then</span> <span data-start="340.94" data-end="341.569">you rotate</span> <span data-start="341.569" data-end="342.919">on another point then you translate</span> <span data-start="342.919" data-end="346.749">around town point and that sounds good</span> <span data-start="346.749" data-end="351.11">no doesn't sound good at all hey the</span> <span data-start="351.11" data-end="353.029">problem with that approach is that later</span> <span data-start="353.029" data-end="355.459">on you can't really okay you use your</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.459" data-end="358.099">Tate used cave you rotate it on site now</span> <span data-start="358.099" data-end="359.689">you want to get the transformation of</span> <span data-start="359.689" data-end="361.999">the element how you going to do this are</span> <span data-start="361.999" data-end="363.589">you going to animate the transformation</span> <span data-start="363.589" data-end="365.779">a felony this approach of this API</span> <span data-start="365.779" data-end="368.24">doesn't really work well this which you</span> <span data-start="368.24" data-end="369.589">provide a different approach it has a</span> <span data-start="369.589" data-end="371.449">transform a tribute which contains a</span> <span data-start="371.449" data-end="375.05">string which contains the comment i like</span> <span data-start="375.05" data-end="377.089">idea of one attribute which keeps all</span> <span data-start="377.089" data-end="380.689">the data but the format's of this not</span> <span data-start="380.689" data-end="383.27">really good i look at the canvas API</span> <span data-start="383.27" data-end="386.089">don't want to talk about can see the SVG</span> <span data-start="386.089" data-end="387.86">is a little bit better but it's still</span> <span data-start="387.86" data-end="390.709">not good enough so i was thinking about</span> <span data-start="390.709" data-end="393.86">this and I will decided it sounds it's</span> <span data-start="393.86" data-end="395.3">the problem sounds familiar there is</span> <span data-start="395.3" data-end="400.999">already in SVG the API for linked</span> <span data-start="400.999" data-end="403.429">comments with the parameters it's called</span> <span data-start="403.429" data-end="406.339">a SVG path when you create SVG path you</span> <span data-start="406.339" data-end="408.199">have a comment and you have parameters</span> <span data-start="408.199" data-end="410.119">you move to this point draw a line to</span> <span data-start="410.119" data-end="412.069">this point it draw a cubic vizier to</span> <span data-start="412.069" data-end="414.08">this point you draw something else and i</span> <span data-start="414.08" data-end="415.789">decide that it would be in spirit of s</span> <span data-start="415.789" data-end="417.169">with you to fold the same pattern for</span> <span data-start="417.169" data-end="419.24">transformation and that's this API</span> <span data-start="419.24" data-end="425.449">appears so you give a string in string</span> <span data-start="425.449" data-end="427.189">each letter represents a comment and</span> <span data-start="427.189" data-end="429.889">numbers represent the values you pass to</span> <span data-start="429.889" data-end="431.689">the comment so for example the first</span> <span data-start="431.689" data-end="434.529">line grid like rotate 30 degree around</span> <span data-start="434.529" data-end="438.169">100-120 then rotate minus 45 degree</span> <span data-start="438.169" data-end="443.329">around 6210 then you could when you ask</span> <span data-start="443.329" data-end="444.949">for transformation give you a string so</span> <span data-start="444.949" data-end="446.479">you could ask this element what is your</span> <span data-start="446.479" data-end="448.459">transformation grab this transformation</span> <span data-start="448.459" data-end="450.979">applied to another element and when you</span> <span data-start="450.979" data-end="452.599">get it you get it as an array of commons</span> <span data-start="452.599" data-end="454.069">you could easily parse it goes through</span> <span data-start="454.069" data-end="455.689">the comments remove some commons at new</span> <span data-start="455.689" data-end="458.18">ones you can also spin you specify you</span> <span data-start="458.18" data-end="460.999">could also use the ellipses and in this</span> <span data-start="460.999" data-end="462.469">case energies would be replaced with the</span> <span data-start="462.469" data-end="464.719">current transformation of fun element in</span> <span data-start="464.719" data-end="466.639">this case they say like scale twice and</span> <span data-start="466.639" data-end="468.079">then apply whatever current</span> <span data-start="468.079" data-end="470.689">transformation is and on the last third</span> <span data-start="470.689" data-end="473.12">line i say okay whatever it is now</span> <span data-start="473.12" data-end="474.449">transformation then scale</span> <span data-start="474.449" data-end="477.749">you twice around 100 hundred position</span> <span data-start="477.749" data-end="479.849">and boot absolutely so the law case</span> <span data-start="479.849" data-end="482.809">letter means relative transformation</span> <span data-start="482.809" data-end="485.61">uppercase mean scale you could rotate</span> <span data-start="485.61" data-end="487.11">you could translate you could scale and</span> <span data-start="487.11" data-end="489.779">first time in Rafael you could do matrix</span> <span data-start="489.779" data-end="491.729">transformation so just like pretty much</span> <span data-start="491.729" data-end="498.21">any transformation animation the</span> <span data-start="498.21" data-end="500.849">animation in Rafael is actually pretty</span> <span data-start="500.849" data-end="503.909">good and the API is pretty nice and</span> <span data-start="503.909" data-end="508.699">nobody was complaining except me so I</span> <span data-start="508.699" data-end="513.089">don't I look at other api's of animation</span> <span data-start="513.089" data-end="516.8">and I don't like any of them because</span> <span data-start="516.8" data-end="520.459">they don't give you flexibility and</span> <span data-start="520.459" data-end="524.219">sorry let's just look at what I've did</span> <span data-start="524.219" data-end="526.139">so let this is a small example of the</span> <span data-start="526.139" data-end="529.62">animation this is a sort of pac-man like</span> <span data-start="529.62" data-end="532.199">animation so I click on this circle it</span> <span data-start="532.199" data-end="536.639">moves on that's pretty simple right</span> <span data-start="536.639" data-end="538.709">let's see this code how it's actually</span> <span data-start="538.709" data-end="546.36">done not here yeah right so we include</span> <span data-start="546.36" data-end="550.589">the Raphael and then we create them here</span> <span data-start="550.589" data-end="553.47">we create the Raphael colder FL</span> <span data-start="553.47" data-end="557.459">functionally create the surface and then</span> <span data-start="557.459" data-end="559.47">the raffle function now have a fourth</span> <span data-start="559.47" data-end="561.72">parameter which function call back so it</span> <span data-start="561.72" data-end="563.67">will create surfaces on Dom ready then</span> <span data-start="563.67" data-end="566.43">call the callback and the surface will</span> <span data-start="566.43" data-end="568.889">be called call back in the context of</span> <span data-start="568.889" data-end="571.5">the surface the surface become this now</span> <span data-start="571.5" data-end="575.579">this CAC AIT's a new Elias for custom</span> <span data-start="575.579" data-end="577.889">attributes so the custom attributes</span> <span data-start="577.889" data-end="579.779">exist before just I want to again</span> <span data-start="579.779"

bit ago so the</span> <span data-start="686.129" data-end="689.649">this the animation usually represents</span> <span data-start="689.649" data-end="691.87">like you you click the click the button</span> <span data-start="691.87" data-end="693.97">you start the animation and while it's</span> <span data-start="693.97" data-end="696.069">going you have no idea what's going on</span> <span

data-end="702.04">animations finished but you if you want</span> <span data-start="702.04" data-end="703.72">really to know the status of animation</span> <span data-start="703.72" data-end="705.37">any point of the time you don't you</span> <span data-start="705.37" data-end="708.309">don't really have a tools to get it so</span> <span data-start="708.309" data-end="711.1">in Rafael too i introduced a new feature</span> <span data-start="711.1" data-end="712.809">so you could actually give their status</span> <span data-start="712.809" data-end="714.61">of animation and you could change the</span> <span data-start="714.61" data-end="716.8">status of animation that give you</span> <span data-start="716.8" data-end="719.17">ability to totally control any

<span data-start="725.379" data-end="727.42">the point where it stops and so on and</span> <span data-start="727.42" data-end="737.73">so far I think it's awesome</span> <span data-start="737.74" data-end="740.41">well doesn't doesn't look like this you</span> <span data-start="740.41" data-end="743.7">lost your phone so they all they all</span> <span data-start="743.7" data-end="746.5">were all apic rocks you still could</span> <span data-start="746.5" data-end="747.85">create animation like that so you</span> <span data-start="747.85" data-end="750.43">animate to the new attributes during</span> <span data-start="750.43" data-end="753.16">this time is in Quebec but behind the</span> <span data-start="753.16" data-end="755.77">scene to create the animation object but</span> <span data-start="755.77" data-end="756.79">you could do it yourself you could</span> <span data-start="756.79" data-end="759.22">create animation object and then you</span> <span data-start="759.22" data-end="761.41">could animate element just like that it</span> <span data-start="761.41" data-end="763.54">was the object the good thing about it</span> <span data-start="763.54" data-end="764.92">then later you could say what's your</span> <span data-start="764.92" data-end="768.07">status and the element which I ok I'm in</span> <span data-start="768.07" data-end="770.2">three animations right now the first</span> <span data-start="770.2" data-end="771.91">animation am in the beginning the second</span> <span data-start="771.91" data-end="773.26">animation I'm in the middle in the last</span> <span data-start="773.26" data-end="775.27">animations I'm about to finish and this</span> <span data-start="775.27" data-end="776.83">is animations now okay I'll grab the</span> <span data-start="776.83" data-end="778.63">second animation apply to this element</span> <span data-start="778.63" data-end="780.04">because I wanted him to move like that</span> <span data-start="780.04" data-end="784.18">and so on so the API is like that there</span> <span data-start="784.18" data-end="786.37">is a method status and by default</span> <span data-start="786.37" data-end="787.84">settings which only array of all these</span> <span data-start="787.84" data-end="790.63">animations and their statuses if you</span> <span data-start="790.63" data-end="792.19">pass the animation object it reaching</span> <span data-start="792.19" data-end="794.74">the number from 0 to 1 depending where</span> <span data-start="794.74" data-end="798.04">the animation is but if you it also set</span> <span data-start="798.04" data-end="801.36">us so if you pass the number and the</span> <span data-start="801.36" data-end="804.43">animation then it will change the status</span> <span data-start="804.43" data-end="806.77">of this current animation jumps to the</span> <span data-start="806.77" data-end="808.63">position you specify forward to backward</span> <span data-start="808.63" data-end="810.43">depending on the current status you</span> <span data-start="810.43" data-end="812.41">could pause and resume you could stop</span> <span data-start="812.41" data-end="814.84">said time is basically a shortcut for</span> <span data-start="814.84" data-end="817.39">status but you use milliseconds from the</span> <span data-start="817.39" data-end="819.67">beginning of the animation for example</span> <span data-start="819.67" data-end="821.77">if you want to sing Chris keep better</span> <span data-start="821.77" data-end="824.19">parade milliseconds and percentage and</span> <span data-start="824.19" data-end="826.78">the animation has method delay and</span> <span data-start="826.78" data-end="829.54">repeats delay means it started up right</span> <span data-start="829.54" data-end="831.49">now but after some given period of</span> <span data-start="831.49" data-end="833.53">milliseconds and repeat basically it</span> <span data-start="833.53" data-end="835.72">will go to the end then roll back to the</span> <span data-start="835.72" data-end="838.24">beginning and go again and let's as many</span> <span data-start="838.24" data-end="839.83">times in specify if you want infinite</span> <span data-start="839.83" data-end="848.53">loop you pass infinity ok events I'm</span> <span data-start="848.53" data-end="850.27">generally big fan of event driven</span> <span data-start="850.27" data-end="852.46">development and event-driven</span> <span data-start="852.46" data-end="854.62">architecture so I was thinking that</span> <span data-start="854.62" data-end="856.27">events is something the draw file is</span> <span data-start="856.27" data-end="859.93">missing so not so long ago i wrote the</span> <span data-start="859.93" data-end="862.63">library called EGS which is basically</span> <span data-start="862.63" data-end="865.15">event managing custom event managing</span> <span data-start="865.15" data-end="867.67">thing and somebody asked me yesterday</span> <span data-start="867.67" data-end="869.12">why I don't use some</span> <span data-start="869.12" data-end="872.24">some existing libraries for events well</span> <span data-start="872.24" data-end="873.8">basically because when I wrote it they</span> <span data-start="873.8" data-end="878.029">didn't exist yet so you could use</span> <span data-start="878.029" data-end="879.56">recovery for that so I'm not promoting</span> <span data-start="879.56" data-end="881.33">this library I mean you don't you don't</span> <span data-start="881.33" data-end="882.74">have to use it but Raphael have it</span> <span data-start="882.74" data-end="888.56">inside so how it works it work Raphael</span> <span data-start="888.56" data-end="890.839">always firing the events in the eve</span> <span data-start="890.839" data-end="892.76">space so you could always listen to</span> <span data-start="892.76" data-end="895.91">events and lots of internal features are</span> <span data-start="895.91" data-end="898.58">bounded on events but you can do it like</span> <span data-start="898.58" data-end="901.19">that so you could say okay Eve on an</span> <span data-start="901.19" data-end="903.71">animation do some function that means on</span> <span data-start="903.71" data-end="906.89">any animation event animation related</span> <span data-start="906.89" data-end="908.96">event in the Raphael it will call this</span> <span data-start="908.96" data-end="910.58">function so if you start animation stop</span> <span data-start="910.58" data-end="913.13">animation animation frame or you could</span> <span data-start="913.13" data-end="914.72">say on each animation start call me</span> <span data-start="914.72" data-end="917.06">function some animation started or each</span> <span data-start="917.06" data-end="919.91">animation start the idea of element for</span> <span data-start="919.91" data-end="921.38">this particular element called the</span> <span data-start="921.38" data-end="924.92">function all a niche animation related</span> <span data-start="924.92" data-end="926.66">event for this particular element of</span> <span data-start="926.66" data-end="929.36">this function all you get the point</span> <span data-start="929.36" data-end="937.13">again hope so this is a another thing I</span> <span data-start="937.13" data-end="941.75">had let's say you want to draw the the</span> <span data-start="941.75" data-end="943.97">polyline this is actually how your</span> <span data-start="943.97" data-end="945.65">approach to draw a line like that it's</span> <span data-start="945.65" data-end="948.47">very easy to do it in SVG or in Raphael</span> <span data-start="948.47" data-end="950.87">for that sake and the problem that it's</span> <span data-start="950.87" data-end="954.41">not always what you want sometimes it's</span> <span data-start="954.41" data-end="955.88">quite easy but it's sometimes you want</span> <span data-start="955.88" data-end="958.16">to cure and the only thing you know it's</span> <span data-start="958.16" data-end="960.41">points which curve is going through and</span> <span data-start="960.41" data-end="961.97">you don't really want to create its</span> <span data-start="961.97" data-end="963.95">pubic began thinking how they should go</span> <span data-start="963.95" data-end="967.04">so basically you need to draw the spline</span> <span data-start="967.04" data-end="969.29">so I had new Commons in Rafael so now</span> <span data-start="969.29" data-end="971.36">it's easier said you could create the</span> <span data-start="971.36" data-end="974.9">curve which without much trouble the</span> <span data-start="974.9" data-end="976.07">only difference that instead of</span> <span data-start="976.07" data-end="979.25">specifying the common l-proline
