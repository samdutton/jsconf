<p><span data-start="17.24" data-end="19.49">my name is Tommy scratch I work for a</span> <span data-start="19.49" data-end="21.02">company called joint which you may be</span> <span data-start="21.02" data-end="24.71">heard of we do stuff with node which</span> <span data-start="24.71" data-end="28.97">you've also may be heard of and yeah i'm</span> <span data-start="28.97" data-end="30.65">writing this book i don't recommend</span> <span data-start="30.65" data-end="33.949">writing a book it's a stupid idea if</span> <span data-start="33.949" data-end="35.21">anybody ever tells you to write a book</span> <span data-start="35.21" data-end="37.4">you know just ignore them or hurt them</span> <span data-start="37.4" data-end="40.64">or both but this is this is the book i'm</span> <span data-start="40.64" data-end="42.23">writing in case wondering that's a</span> <span data-start="42.23" data-end="45.17">common tree true cuz alrighty clearly</span> <span data-start="45.17" data-end="50.479">let me pick my animal you know so I the</span> <span data-start="50.479" data-end="52.61">talk is multi Ted node architectures but</span> <span data-start="52.61" data-end="54.68">you know I wanted to kind of recap some</span> <span data-start="54.68" data-end="57.5">stuff I think the the people at Jay's</span> <span data-start="57.5" data-end="58.879">convoy always really smart but I think</span> <span data-start="58.879" data-end="60.53">often kind of looking at the core</span> <span data-start="60.53" data-end="61.61">principles of what we're trying to</span> <span data-start="61.61" data-end="65.449">achieve really helps so you know one of</span> <span data-start="65.449" data-end="66.47">the things that we want to do when we</span> <span data-start="66.47" data-end="68.78">write servers is minimize the client</span> <span data-start="68.78" data-end="69.89">response time and this is actually like</span> <span data-start="69.89" data-end="71.99">a big draw of why people use node right</span> <span data-start="71.99" data-end="73.67">is we want really fast service because</span> <span data-start="73.67" data-end="76.43">you know sometimes people just can't</span> <span data-start="76.43" data-end="79.61">wait to do stuff and you know that that</span> <span data-start="79.61" data-end="81.5">can be an issue in case we running I</span> <span data-start="81.5" data-end="84.109">also used to work for Yahoo so that's</span> <span data-start="84.109" data-end="91.85">the Yahoo that's a yahoo bathroom so the</span> <span data-start="91.85" data-end="93.77">goal number two is well sure we won't</span> <span data-start="93.77" data-end="96.049">really fast response times but you know</span> <span data-start="96.049" data-end="97.85">heck I only have so many servers you</span> <span data-start="97.85" data-end="100.46">know I mean I guess we could buy like a</span> <span data-start="100.46" data-end="102.079">server for every user that we have and</span> <span data-start="102.079" data-end="103.729">then all of their response times would</span> <span data-start="103.729" data-end="106.189">be really fast but nobody can obviously</span> <span data-start="106.189" data-end="107.24">nobody can afford to do that that's</span> <span data-start="107.24" data-end="109.64">stupid so it's you know we have we have</span> <span data-start="109.64" data-end="111.319">these two conflicting goals it's like</span> <span data-start="111.319" data-end="113.649">how do we how do we balance these things</span> <span data-start="113.649" data-end="116.719">because obviously you know at some point</span> <span data-start="116.719" data-end="118.729">we hit the capacity of our servers and</span> <span data-start="118.729" data-end="120.139">sometimes you know even if you're</span> <span data-start="120.139" data-end="122.45">planning capacity there's there's there</span> <span data-start="122.45" data-end="124.67">are issues there so I like to think of</span> <span data-start="124.67" data-end="127.34">this in in kind of the critical path</span> <span data-start="127.34" data-end="128.72">like one of the things I think people</span> <span data-start="128.72" data-end="130.55">people think of like these really</span> <span data-start="130.55" data-end="132.56">generalize models are computing and what</span> <span data-start="132.56" data-end="135.2">it comes down to for me is we have a</span> <span data-start="135.2" data-end="137.36">critical path this is what an Internet</span> <span data-start="137.36" data-end="139.1">application looks like a modern Internet</span> <span data-start="139.1" data-end="142.16">application looks like this you have</span> <span data-start="142.16" data-end="144.26">this big red blob of like network</span> <span data-start="144.26" data-end="146.09">latency at the front and this is</span> <span data-start="146.09" data-end="147.62">obviously this is really simplified but</span> <span data-start="147.62" data-end="149.78">you know the the talking back and</span> <span data-start="149.78" data-end="151.28">with a web client of the internet is</span> <span data-start="151.28" data-end="153.26">really slow compared to the actual</span> <span data-start="153.26" data-end="155.03">amount of computation it takes to render</span> <span data-start="155.03" data-end="158.12">a web page talking to the database it's</span> <span data-start="158.12" data-end="160.459">really slow compared to the actual time</span> <span data-start="160.459" data-end="161.93">it takes to do a query in general not</span> <span data-start="161.93" data-end="164.75">all queries but in general this is this</span> <span data-start="164.75" data-end="166.55">is generally true if you mean think</span> <span data-start="166.55" data-end="168.95">about Google if every time you typed in</span> <span data-start="168.95" data-end="170.81">a search query Google went out and</span> <span data-start="170.81" data-end="173.5">spidered the entire internet compiled</span> <span data-start="173.5" data-end="176.48">you know a search index and then gave</span> <span data-start="176.48" data-end="177.47">you back your result would be like a</span> <span data-start="177.47" data-end="180.05">month the point is that we take all the</span> <span data-start="180.05" data-end="182.66">computation as far away from the user as</span> <span data-start="182.66" data-end="184.55">possible so when the user is actually</span> <span data-start="184.55" data-end="186.17">interacting with the website the web</span> <span data-start="186.17" data-end="188.33">application whatever system it is that</span> <span data-start="188.33" data-end="192.23">we're doing the the maximum the biggest</span> <span data-start="192.23" data-end="194.39">pieces of this time is some kind of</span> <span data-start="194.39" data-end="196.88">rooting some kind of network transfer</span> <span data-start="196.88" data-end="199">and the actual amount of computation is</span> <span data-start="199" data-end="201.86">as small as possible and these are the</span> <span data-start="201.86" data-end="205.069">models of applications we build now so</span> <span data-start="205.069" data-end="206.51">the traditional way that we do this is</span> <span data-start="206.51" data-end="208.91">we pre allocate resources to the client</span> <span data-start="208.91" data-end="210.35">for the for the entire duration of the</span> <span data-start="210.35" data-end="212.18">request we go here you go here's a bunch</span> <span data-start="212.18" data-end="214.459">of resources and that gives you</span> <span data-start="214.459" data-end="216.23">efficiency within each individual</span> <span data-start="216.23" data-end="218.269">connection you give a bunch of resources</span> <span data-start="218.269" data-end="221.87">away and you get you know you get a lot</span> <span data-start="221.87" data-end="224.09">of efficiency it's like his here's a big</span> <span data-start="224.09" data-end="226.91">size of resources and that means that</span> <span data-start="226.91" data-end="228.709">the response time for this individual</span> <span data-start="228.709" data-end="230.51">connection is going to be really fast</span> <span data-start="230.51" data-end="231.98">because they've already given them all</span> <span data-start="231.98" data-end="234.32">the resources that they need to do this</span> <span data-start="234.32" data-end="236.03">so as soon as anything happens I'm</span> <span data-start="236.03" data-end="238.4">instantly ready to go so they kind of</span> <span data-start="238.4" data-end="240.44">makes sense you know I think of it like</span> <span data-start="240.44" data-end="243.23">this you know if the the you know if the</span> <span data-start="243.23" data-end="245.75">pie is my server I have like a certain</span> <span data-start="245.75" data-end="247.459">amount of resources it's just dedicated</span> <span data-start="247.459" data-end="249.62">to running you know whether it's node or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="249.62" data-end="252.799">Apache or you know tom cat or whatever</span> <span data-start="252.799" data-end="254.6">and then every request you start to</span> <span data-start="254.6" data-end="256.7">share out the pie and you give each one</span> <span data-start="256.7" data-end="260.57">of these two requests and you know</span> <span data-start="260.57" data-end="262.94">that's great but we basically heavily</span> <span data-start="262.94" data-end="265.01">waste memory in order to serve the</span> <span data-start="265.01" data-end="268.34">fastest most optimal requests and when</span> <span data-start="268.34" data-end="270.46">you run out of you know memory the</span> <span data-start="270.46" data-end="272.66">Soviets overwhelmed and that's you know</span> <span data-start="272.66" data-end="274.49">that's kind of bad it's like fighting</span> <span data-start="274.49" data-end="276.71">off lobsters with a stick I guess to</span> <span data-start="276.71" data-end="278.89">stretch your metaphor I don't know um</span> <span data-start="278.89" data-end="281.21">actually I tried this talk somewhere</span> <span data-start="281.21" data-end="282.919">else and somebody had called me and said</span> <span data-start="282.919" data-end="283.61">those aren't lobs</span> <span data-start="283.61" data-end="288.289">those are crabs you know it's kind of</span> <span data-start="288.289" data-end="289.46">weird I mean to be honest I don't know</span> <span data-start="289.46" data-end="290.689">this gentleman well enough to know if</span> <span data-start="290.689" data-end="294.259">those are crabs or not that was awful</span> <span data-start="294.259" data-end="297.59">wasn't it but seriously I mean I think</span> <span data-start="297.59" data-end="299.509">the it's it's it's it's a model that</span> <span data-start="299.509" data-end="301.189">kind of it makes sense in principle but</span> <span data-start="301.189" data-end="302.629">we have these real-world constraints we</span> <span data-start="302.629" data-end="304.31">can't have as many services we want and</span> <span data-start="304.31" data-end="306.129">this is where the event loop comes in so</span> <span data-start="306.129" data-end="309.56">if you don't pre allocate memory what</span> <span data-start="309.56" data-end="312.05">happens we create a placeholder for so</span> <span data-start="312.05" data-end="313.61">test so this is kind of I mean this is</span> <span data-start="313.61" data-end="315.62">still kind of node 101 stuff but we have</span> <span data-start="315.62" data-end="317.479">all these placeholders and then we have</span> <span data-start="317.479" data-end="319.009">this shade work resource like now I have</span> <span data-start="319.009" data-end="321.259">some work to do I'm going to do it the</span> <span data-start="321.259" data-end="322.699">servers going to use memory in order to</span> <span data-start="322.699" data-end="324.949">deal with this one specific task we have</span> <span data-start="324.949" data-end="327.469">the first-in first-out model so we have</span> <span data-start="327.469" data-end="329.599">a bunch of events you can see that for</span> <span data-start="329.599" data-end="331.879">each individual event whether it's like</span> <span data-start="331.879" data-end="334.61">an event created by the node application</span> <span data-start="334.61" data-end="337.37">or from the OS it goes in and it comes</span> <span data-start="337.37" data-end="340.039">up but you know that makes the server</span> <span data-start="340.039" data-end="341.479">more efficient but it then creates this</span> <span data-start="341.479" data-end="343.36">thing well we can't block the event loop</span> <span data-start="343.36" data-end="346.189">so people start to you no wonder well</span> <span data-start="346.189" data-end="348.77">i'm using this model how do i actually</span> <span data-start="348.77" data-end="350.81">make the most of my service what are the</span> <span data-start="350.81" data-end="354.319">architectures that really helped me so</span> <span data-start="354.319" data-end="357.889">if i do big work in the event loop then</span> <span data-start="357.889" data-end="360.68">we can only serve after that after that</span> <span data-start="360.68" data-end="363.11">request is finished so you know this is</span> <span data-start="363.11" data-end="364.19">kind of this is like a different</span> <span data-start="364.19" data-end="365.659">programming model people like what I get</span> <span data-start="365.659" data-end="367.61">the other thing you know I just have</span> <span data-start="367.61" data-end="370.19">like one thread per user and I don't</span> <span data-start="370.19" data-end="371.509">have to think about it but now I'm in</span> <span data-start="371.509" data-end="374.21">the shared memory you know I'm sharing</span> <span data-start="374.21" data-end="375.83">all of this stuff how do i how do I do</span> <span data-start="375.83" data-end="377.21">that I have to worry about these big</span> <span data-start="377.21" data-end="379.789">tasks so blocking the event loop is just</span> <span data-start="379.789" data-end="383.02">bad nobody wants to do that you know um</span> <span data-start="383.02" data-end="384.86">don't worry we're going to run out of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="384.86" data-end="387.979">I'm never that bad metaphor soon but</span> <span data-start="387.979" data-end="389.509">nobody wants to block the event loop so</span> <span data-start="389.509" data-end="390.56">it's like how do I do that how do i</span> <span data-start="390.56" data-end="392.24">create an architecture with node that</span> <span data-start="392.24" data-end="394.189">makes it work efficiently so this is the</span> <span data-start="394.189" data-end="396.05">obvious architecture and everybody uses</span> <span data-start="396.05" data-end="398.479">this in you know it's not rocket science</span> <span data-start="398.479" data-end="400.909">but it is a tiered architecture I have</span> <span data-start="400.909" data-end="403.43">my client and then I have some kind of</span> <span data-start="403.43" data-end="404.93">like node front end and then I have</span> <span data-start="404.93" data-end="407.12">database and this is I mean this is like</span> <span data-start="407.12" data-end="409.43">a really simple architecture but it's</span> <span data-start="409.43" data-end="411.74">it's clearly multi-tiered the database</span> <span data-start="411.74" data-end="414.139">is doing stuff that isn't in the main</span> <span data-start="414.139" data-end="415.969">node process we're not blocking we're</span> <span data-start="415.969" data-end="416.99">using eight</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.99" data-end="419.84">Kronus I oh and this this already is a</span> <span data-start="419.84" data-end="421.88">multi-tiered architecture you're pushing</span> <span data-start="421.88" data-end="424.07">the database work out so it's not</span> <span data-start="424.07" data-end="426.2">blocking the rest of the node process</span> <span data-start="426.2" data-end="428.15">right i mean we could just you know we</span> <span data-start="428.15" data-end="430.67">could have all of that together what</span> <span data-start="430.67" data-end="431.84">about something like this this is</span> <span data-start="431.84" data-end="433.13">something that I think a lot of people</span> <span data-start="433.13" data-end="435.47">were starting to play with will you know</span> <span data-start="435.47" data-end="439.55">if big things are no too bad how about I</span> <span data-start="439.55" data-end="441.11">do something like this so I want to do</span> <span data-start="441.11" data-end="443.42">clients maybe I want to use Jess domin</span> <span data-start="443.42" data-end="445.13">order to render all of my results people</span> <span data-start="445.13" data-end="447.5">people really like the idea of doing</span> <span data-start="447.5" data-end="449.87">stuff with jess Tom and that's cool I</span> <span data-start="449.87" data-end="452.18">think that's really interesting but it's</span> <span data-start="452.18" data-end="454.01">like well what if you know if if all of</span> <span data-start="454.01" data-end="456.38">the j estan stuff is really big I should</span> <span data-start="456.38" data-end="458.03">move that like a separate thing outside</span> <span data-start="458.03" data-end="460.88">of my main node process right and then</span> <span data-start="460.88" data-end="461.99">you end up with an architecture like</span> <span data-start="461.99" data-end="465.41">this well why would you do that one of</span> <span data-start="465.41" data-end="466.7">the things people want more paralyzation</span> <span data-start="466.7" data-end="468.82">like I'm spreading out my load I'm</span> <span data-start="468.82" data-end="471.71">creating more task synchronization but</span> <span data-start="471.71" data-end="474.47">if we look back at this diagram when</span> <span data-start="474.47" data-end="476">you're using something like Jess DOM and</span> <span data-start="476" data-end="478.4">you're just increasing the size of these</span> <span data-start="478.4" data-end="480.38">computational units you're just</span> <span data-start="480.38" data-end="482.81">increasing the size the critical path is</span> <span
