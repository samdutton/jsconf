is</span> <span data-start="188.3" data-end="191.87">interesting and obviously again you have</span> <span data-start="191.87" data-end="194.96">the instance and thanks to this house</span> <span

data-end="213.41">object exam + that's the library I</span> <span data-start="213.41" data-end="217.31">alluded to at the beginning javascript</span> <span data-start="217.31" data-end="220.61">has several kinds of object factories</span> <span data-start="220.61" data-end="224.48">two examples are you can produce an</span> <span data-start="224.48" data-end="227.63">instance via a function and those</span> <span data-start="227.63" data-end="229.82">functions are there's other</span> <span data-start="229.82" data-end="231.5">possibilities those functions are</span> <span data-start="231.5" data-end="234.95">usually the Constructors other than that</span> <span data-start="234.95" data-end="240.2">you have objects and you can use those</span> <span data-start="240.2" data-end="243.41">and object create to produce an instance</span> <span data-start="243.41" data-end="248.03">- but then the question arises how do we</span> <span data-start="248.03" data-end="251.06">call all of that what's the the common</span> <span data-start="251.06" data-end="253.31">word for what's going on what's what's a</span> <span data-start="253.31" data-end="255.86">good word for object Factory and Alan</span> <span data-start="255.86" data-end="259.82">where sprach one of the tc39 people he</span> <span data-start="259.82" data-end="262.79">suggested the term exemplar and if you</span> <span data-start="262.79" data-end="264.98">use that term then you can call</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="267.47">constructors function exemplars and</span> <span data-start="267.47" data-end="270.08">whatever is going on here you can call</span> <span data-start="270.08" data-end="276.89">that object exemplars so let's look at</span> <span data-start="276.89" data-end="280.63">two examples this is the almost</span> <span data-start="280.63" data-end="283.11">canonical example of a person</span> <span data-start="283.11" data-end="285.85">you have the constructor function and</span> <span data-start="285.85" data-end="289.93">you have the prototype and to create an</span> <span data-start="289.93" data-end="294.13">instance let's call the instance Joe and</span> <span data-start="294.13" data-end="298.15">this is kind of wrong name so should be</span> <span data-start="298.15" data-end="299.74">called Joe but doesn't matter</span> <span data-start="299.74" data-end="303.73">inconsistent data if you create an</span> <span data-start="303.73" data-end="307.09">instance then you use the new operator</span> <span data-start="307.09" data-end="309.97">and that's like the standard way of</span> <span data-start="309.97" data-end="312.58">doing it but you can also create the</span> <span data-start="312.58" data-end="317.41">exact same instance by just using an</span> <span data-start="317.41" data-end="319.72">object if you use object.create you</span> <span data-start="319.72" data-end="323.23">create a fresh object whose prototype is</span> <span data-start="323.23" data-end="325.39">person dot prototype then you have Joe</span> <span data-start="325.39" data-end="329.92">who sometimes crossdressers and then to</span> <span data-start="329.92" data-end="333.34">instance to instantiate to to fill that</span> <span data-start="333.34" data-end="338.11">with data you invoke the constructor but</span> <span data-start="338.11" data-end="343.18">you do so as a method and then what you</span> <span data-start="343.18" data-end="347.26">end up with you have like the instance</span> <span data-start="347.26" data-end="349.72">show you end up with is exactly the same</span> <span data-start="349.72" data-end="352.33">as if you had created it by a new new</span> <span data-start="352.33" data-end="360.22">person and then let's further examine</span> <span data-start="360.22" data-end="363.04">function exemplars and there you have</span> <span data-start="363.04" data-end="366.19">two main entities you have the</span> <span data-start="366.19" data-end="368.97">constructor and you have its prototype</span> <span data-start="368.97" data-end="373.08">what do those entities do the</span> <span data-start="373.08" data-end="375.7">constructor is there for instantiation</span> <span data-start="375.7" data-end="378.88">and the prototype is there for</span> <span data-start="378.88" data-end="382.72">everything else so here are a few</span> <span data-start="382.72" data-end="384.7">examples if you make an instance of</span> <span data-start="384.7" data-end="387.94">check internally what you actually do is</span> <span data-start="387.94" data-end="391.03">if you if we want to see is X and</span> <span data-start="391.03" data-end="393.25">instance of see what you actually do is</span> <span data-start="393.25" data-end="397">you check whether C dot prototype is in</span> <span data-start="397" data-end="401.23">the prototype chain of X so there it's</span> <span data-start="401.23" data-end="403.72">just the prototype that matters here</span> <span data-start="403.72" data-end="406.48">again if you if you subtype if you</span> <span data-start="406.48" data-end="408.49">create a sub constructor if you extend</span> <span data-start="408.49" data-end="412.24">an existing constructor also what you</span> <span data-start="412.24" data-end="416.23">mostly connect is the sub prototype with</span> <span data-start="416.23" data-end="416.47">the</span> <span data-start="416.47" data-end="420.57">super prototype if you do a super call</span> <span data-start="420.57" data-end="423.34">obviously you need to refer to the super</span> <span data-start="423.34" data-end="425.56">method via the prototype so it's again</span> <span data-start="425.56" data-end="429.55">the prototype and if you use generic</span> <span data-start="429.55" data-end="433.42">methods it's the same principle so what</span> <span data-start="433.42" data-end="435.88">you have is prototype is used all the</span> <span data-start="435.88" data-end="441.76">time the constructor only once but then</span> <span data-start="441.76" data-end="445.39">you have to ask the question what do we</span> <span data-start="445.39" data-end="447.22">need to construct us for why wouldn't</span> <span data-start="447.22" data-end="451.63">things be neater if we only worked with</span> <span data-start="451.63" data-end="454.72">the the prototypes and then we'd always</span> <span data-start="454.72" data-end="457.9">have in we wouldn't have this relatively</span> <span data-start="457.9" data-end="459.25">complicated wiring</span> <span data-start="459.25" data-end="462.75">we'd only have a single very nice</span> <span data-start="462.75" data-end="470.5">prototype chain and this is what such an</span> <span data-start="470.5" data-end="472.99">approach would look if you created a</span> <span data-start="472.99" data-end="476.26">noun and here everything is proper here</span> <span data-start="476.26" data-end="479.71">you have Jane whose name is Jane and who</span> <span data-start="479.71" data-end="483.1">has a title and that instance is an</span> <span data-start="483.1" data-end="485.86">instance of its prototype of the</span> <span data-start="485.86" data-end="488.47">employee and that prototype is a sub</span> <span data-start="488.47" data-end="493.86">prototype of person and that object is</span> <span data-start="493.86" data-end="499.03">again a prototype ee of the library</span> <span data-start="499.03" data-end="504.88">object that contains kind of the it's</span> <span data-start="504.88" data-end="507.43">kind of the metal object protocol up</span> <span data-start="507.43" data-end="510.01">there so this is the library</span> <span data-start="510.01" data-end="512.26">functionality and it is in and the neat</span> <span data-start="512.26" data-end="515.44">thing is that that is inherited these</span> <span data-start="515.44" data-end="519.25">are extend and new methods that you</span> <span data-start="519.25" data-end="523.03">should be able to invoke on a type on an</span> <span data-start="523.03" data-end="528.87">object exemplar extend says if I have an</span> <span data-start="528.87" data-end="532.839">existing object exemplar such as person</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="532.839" data-end="536.92">I want to extend it and new says I have</span> <span data-start="536.92" data-end="539.14">an object exemplar such as say employee</span> <span data-start="539.14" data-end="541.98">and I want to create an instance from it</span> <span data-start="541.98" data-end="547.06">or of it so this kind of inheritance is</span> <span data-start="547.06" data-end="549.76">neat because the whole library sits up</span> <span data-start="549.76" data-end="551.73">here</span> <span data-start="551.73" data-end="554.02">so this is what it looks like in code</span> <span data-start="554.02" data-end="557.86">you see that person is created by</span> <span data-start="557.86" data-end="561.88">extending proto and it it's basically it</span> <span data-start="561.88" data-end="567.76">is the prototype and then you it has a</span> <span data-start="567.76" data-end="570.19">constructor that sets up the instance it</span> <span data-start="570.19" data-end="573.04">has a method and then you create the</span> <span data-start="573.04" data-end="576.45">employee by extending person again</span> <span data-start="576.45" data-end="579.16">prototype there's some weird stuff down</span> <span data-start="579.16" data-end="582.66">here that we're gonna look at later and</span> <span data-start="582.66" data-end="586.75">so that's it and I think that looks a</span> <span data-start="586.75" data-end="590.29">lot nicer than the snippet we've seen at</span> <span data-start="590.29" data-end="593.02">the beginning and it's easier to picture</span> <span data-start="593.02" data-end="596.79">in your head — it's easier to visualize</span> <span data-start="596.79" data-end="600.73">so this is how you use it and when it</span> <span data-start="600.73" data-end="603.73">comes to creating an instance we're a</span> <span data-start="603.73" data-end="608.589">bit tiny bit different we just call</span> <span data-start="608.589" data-end="611.23">employee dot new we're whereas with</span> <span data-start="611.23" data-end="614.62">function exemplars you would use the new</span> <span data-start="614.62" data-end="619.02">operator and if we want to check whether</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="619.02" data-end="624.579">Jane is an instance of employee what we</span> <span data-start="624.579" data-end="627.82">do is we just check is employee in the</span> <span data-start="627.82" data-end="632.2">prototype chain of Jane so really nice</span> <span data-start="632.2" data-end="634.57">and and if you if you visualized this</span> <span data-start="634.57" data-end="639.67">kind of the chain then just to find out</span> <span data-start="639.67" data-end="642.52">is the object exemplar in the processor</span> <span data-start="642.52" data-end="645.94">time chain that works very nicely I</span> <span data-start="645.94" data-end="648.88">think afterwards after you've created</span> <span data-start="648.88" data-end="652.06">the instance everything is the same you</span> <span data-start="652.06" data-end="655.839">have a the same old instance of you can</span> <span data-start="655.839" data-end="658.69">invoke methods on it so there nothing</span> <span data-start="658.69" data-end="663.55">much changes how many lines of code do</span> <span data-start="663.55" data-end="666.79">you think that is like raise your hands</span> <span data-start="666.79" data-end="671.2">above 50 more than 50 lines of code less</span> <span data-start="671.2" data-end="676.3">raise your hands less so it's</span> <span data-start="676.3" data-end="680.14">the thing is that's everything so</span> <span data-start="680.14" data-end="683.14">slightly cheated down here because if</span> <span data-start="683.14" data-end="687.25">used proto here which we're gonna look</span> <span data-start="687.25" data-end="691.029">at later but it's it's basically already</span> <span data-start="691.029" data-end="693.79">there you don't need a lot of code and</span> <span data-start="693.79" data-end="695.92">this whole idea of prototype chains</span> <span data-start="695.92" data-end="698.86">that's very that's like an incredibly</span> <span data-start="698.86" data-end="705.13">elegant core of JavaScript so let's look</span> <span data-start="705.13" data-end="708.7">at Eggman script six next echo script</span> <span data-start="708.7" data-end="712.779">six we'll have classes but those are</span> <span data-start="712.779" data-end="715.779">classes by name only and I really like</span> <span data-start="715.779" data-end="718.12">the the Brendan Eich video explaining</span> <span data-start="718.12" data-end="721.99">the design of it the so what they're</span> <span data-start="721.99" data-end="725.77">actually are is syntactic sugar for a</span> <span data-start="725.77" data-end="727.57">constructor syntactic sugar for a</span> <span data-start="727.57" data-end="730.06">function so in echo script six you're</span> <span data-start="730.06" data-end="732.88">going to write class and some stuff</span> <span data-start="732.88" data-end="736.24">behind it after it but what you get back</span> <span data-start="736.24" data-end="738.64">is a function so it's only syntactic</span> <span data-start="738.64" data-end="742.63">sugar but the benefits are quite</span> <span data-start="742.63" data-end="746.13">impressive because you get ease of use</span> <span data-start="746.13" data-end="748.589">especially when it comes to subtyping</span> <span

data-end="1005.65">as before and you invoke it so what you</span> <span data-start="1005.65" data-end="1009.61">have here this is internally this is the</span> <span data-start="1009.61" data-end="1015.91">semantics of a super call and then you</span> <span data-start="1015.91" data-end="1019.57">have here's an illustration just to look</span> <span data-start="1019.57" data-end="1023.61">at it again what goes on you if</span> <span data-start="1023.61" data-end="1026.86">described makes a super call you start</span> <span data-start="1026.86" data-end="1029.62">your

so</span> <span data-start="1052.48" data-end="1055.57">that is why this has to stay the same</span> <span data-start="1055.57" data-end="1057.55">you don't want to lose that object down</span> <span data-start="1057.55" data-end="1059.77">here you want to keep that that's where</span> <span data-start="1059.77" data-end="1063.04">the instance data is and if a function</span> <span

data-end="1078.53">then there's one remaining question</span> <span data-start="1078.53" data-end="1081.71">where does the home object come form</span> <span data-start="1081.71"
