data-end="196.73">when you're writing framework code and</span> <span data-start="196.73" data-end="199.43">then I'll do a little I think advocacy</span> <span data-start="199.43" data-end="201.56">around the Java JavaScript community</span> <span data-start="201.56" data-end="203.14">specifically because I think we're</span> <span data-start="203.14"

data-end="212.09">rights I think about eight different</span> <span data-start="212.09" data-end="214.94">applications all but two of them are</span> <span data-start="214.94" data-end="219.2">just

I</span> <span data-start="225.8" data-end="227.84">was very comfortable if I met a bug that</span> <span data-start="227.84" data-end="229.34">could potentially be in the framework</span> <span data-start="229.34" data-end="231.26">level with just walking the stack trace</span> <span data-start="231.26" data-end="234.77">up to that point and you know modifying</span> <span data-start="234.77" data-end="236.48">it if I needed to or understanding that</span> <span data-start="236.48" data-end="238.34">abstraction better whereas JavaScript</span> <span data-start="238.34" data-end="240.77">avada developers tend to really trust</span> <span data-start="240.77" data-end="242.81">their abstractions and I think that</span> <span data-start="242.81" data-end="247.76">that's in some part due to the maturity</span> <span data-start="247.76" data-end="250.82">of that of that group but it's also</span> <span data-start="250.82" data-end="251.959">something that I think the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="251.959" data-end="253.31">community is getting to a place where it</span> <span data-start="253.31" data-end="257.39">could be it that comfortable as well so</span> <span data-start="257.39" data-end="260.989">and in in a recent project I've been</span> <span data-start="260.989" data-end="262.76">writing what is essentially a single</span> <span

out in</span> <span data-start="766.23" data-end="768.329">reality a lot of really great frameworks</span> <span data-start="768.329" data-end="770.669">have come out of individual products</span> <span data-start="770.669" data-end="772.679">where the creator of that product began</span> <span data-start="772.679" data-end="775.169">to slowly pull library after library out</span> <span

this</span> <span data-start="808.25" data-end="811.22">isn't I'm not about to go on a tutorial</span> <span data-start="811.22" data-end="814.63">for how to build frameworks but I will</span> <span

data-end="842.48">framework oh sorry I'm going to start</span> <span data-start="842.48" data-end="845.69">with reading code so I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="845.69" data-end="847.49">about reading other frameworks and how I</span> <span data-start="847.49" data-end="849.08">think that's a good practice to learn</span> <span data-start="849.08" data-end="851.18">how to think in sort of framework level</span> <span data-start="851.18" data-end="854.66">terms then it's deciding what to pull up</span> <span data-start="854.66" data-end="857.06">stream and what to push downstream so</span> <span data-start="857.06" data-end="860.96">what to push on to implementers and what</span> <span data-start="860.96" data-end="863.63">to pull into a framework and then I'll</span> <span data-start="863.63" data-end="866.21">talk about how that decision has to be</span> <span data-start="866.21" data-end="869.24">gone into with with intention and</span> <span data-start="869.24" data-end="870.86">knowing that you're making trade-offs</span> <span data-start="870.86" data-end="872.36">and
