<p><span data-start="39.62" data-end="41.96">JavaScript developer works with a</span> <span data-start="41.96" data-end="44.15">browser right you have some JavaScript</span> <span data-start="44.15" data-end="45.89">then you have some kind of black box and</span> <span data-start="45.89" data-end="47.12">at the end you get some transcript out</span> <span data-start="47.12" data-end="48.62">again so you call a javascript function</span> <span data-start="48.62" data-end="51.02">it's awesome magic and your charm script</span> <span data-start="51.02" data-end="53.39">again and actually the magic in between</span> <span data-start="53.39" data-end="56.239">your C++ so um how many of you are</span> <span data-start="56.239" data-end="59.51">transcript developers how many of you</span> <span data-start="59.51" data-end="63.89">like C++ okay so there's some kind of</span> <span data-start="63.89" data-end="65.96">tension like I want to live in this</span> <span data-start="65.96" data-end="67.97">world but it soon it gets you on you</span> <span data-start="67.97" data-end="70.009">know I just miss one third it's all good</span> <span data-start="70.009" data-end="72.56">so to wait the water person browser</span> <span data-start="72.56" data-end="74.509">indirect is this way the developer comes</span> <span data-start="74.509" data-end="76.94">along and you use this browser it's nice</span> <span data-start="76.94" data-end="79.07">it has API whatever you can do whatever</span> <span data-start="79.07" data-end="82.369">and then also developers tend to they</span> <span data-start="82.369" data-end="84.32">have create ideas so you have the</span> <span data-start="84.32" data-end="86.15">developer you have an idea and then</span> <span data-start="86.15" data-end="87.5">there's a browser which is basically</span> <span data-start="87.5" data-end="89.21">this kind of thing that runs your idea</span> <span data-start="89.21" data-end="92.18">right but problem is sometimes the idea</span> <span data-start="92.18" data-end="93.439">doesn't work because there's something</span> <span data-start="93.439" data-end="95.57">missing and actually that's not good</span> <span data-start="95.57" data-end="97.28">enough it's it's way hard it's like</span> <span data-start="97.28" data-end="99.11">you're developing you have the idea and</span> <span data-start="99.11" data-end="101.33">you hit a wall because you're missing</span> <span data-start="101.33" data-end="104.75">api's and other things that pretend you</span> <span data-start="104.75" data-end="108.17">to make your idea happen and that's</span> <span data-start="108.17" data-end="112.939">pretty sad so am rhein larue had Alex</span> <span data-start="112.939" data-end="116.329">chairs last week a good thing about the</span> <span data-start="116.329" data-end="118.25">web and what is capable of and this is</span> <span data-start="118.25" data-end="121.46">am quoting him if the web doesn't do</span> <span data-start="121.46" data-end="123.259">something right now it's not because it</span> <span data-start="123.259" data-end="125.75">can it's not like it's impossible it</span> <span data-start="125.75" data-end="127.579">just means we haven't gone around doing</span> <span data-start="127.579" data-end="130.759">it yet so it really means imagine that</span> <span data-start="130.759" data-end="133.07">web can do everything I mean this is</span> <span data-start="133.07" data-end="137">this Muslim the weapons platform bootie</span> <span data-start="137" data-end="141.14">g Firefox OS thing maybe but also if you</span> <span data-start="141.14" data-end="142.91">would now be on this auto track web RTC</span> <span data-start="142.91" data-end="146.54">what's possible there and I really think</span> <span data-start="146.54" data-end="148.85">that you can do a lot on on the web but</span> <span data-start="148.85" data-end="151.34">what keeps us back as a developer in</span> <span data-start="151.34" data-end="153.26">javascript is the c++ thing in the</span> <span data-start="153.26" data-end="158.87">middle because what actually okay my</span> <span data-start="158.87" data-end="161.51">slides are wrong order and so because</span> <span data-start="161.51" data-end="163.64">actually transcript developers are</span> <span data-start="163.64" data-end="166.28">pretty much open source guys and mostly</span> <span data-start="166.28" data-end="168.14">if there's some issue or thing they come</span> <span data-start="168.14" data-end="170.21">up with ideas collaborate and for</span> <span data-start="170.21" data-end="172.09">transcript that works pretty well and</span> <span data-start="172.09" data-end="175.37">but for c++ there's some kind of tension</span> <span data-start="175.37" data-end="180.5">and i skip this iRiver or so the web is</span> <span data-start="180.5" data-end="183.13">it's this kind of open thing right and</span> <span data-start="183.13" data-end="185.69">transcript likes open open source whose</span> <span data-start="185.69" data-end="190.04">of you have been at no.10 copper how was</span> <span data-start="190.04" data-end="193.25">it awesome okay so note helicopter is</span> <span data-start="193.25" data-end="195.47">like you trunk controlling em drones</span> <span data-start="195.47" data-end="197.78">with node with an OpenStack because the</span> <span data-start="197.78" data-end="199.28">protocol is open so you can control</span> <span data-start="199.28" data-end="201.59">drone and what that happen is it was</span> <span data-start="201.59" data-end="203.48">like an event of you where you put all</span> <span data-start="203.48" data-end="206.84">kind of open source software together so</span> <span data-start="206.84" data-end="208.76">you have a web sockets you got the web</span> <span data-start="208.76" data-end="211.04">you got new device api's and then it</span> <span data-start="211.04" data-end="214.94">started to put in like open em face</span> <span data-start="214.94" data-end="216.74">detection stuff such drunk and follow</span> <span data-start="216.74" data-end="219.86">you and so transcript people reaches</span> <span data-start="219.86" data-end="222.31">hack together whatever to come along and</span> <span data-start="222.31" data-end="225.02">so and it's also the question so if you</span> <span data-start="225.02" data-end="227">think about web api is if if you have to</span> <span data-start="227" data-end="228.68">transcriptome overs being this kind of</span> <span data-start="228.68" data-end="231.71">openers Kenny thing of web api is being</span> <span data-start="231.71" data-end="233.06">some kind of open source that he could</span> <span data-start="233.06" data-end="234.74">hack as well i mean imagine that that</span> <span data-start="234.74" data-end="237.14">would be awesome right so this is the</span> <span data-start="237.14" data-end="238.88">the thing that i wrote for my talk</span> <span data-start="238.88" data-end="240.74">introduction it's basically person</span> <span data-start="240.74" data-end="242.33">saying hey you know there's something of</span> <span data-start="242.33" data-end="244.01">working on the web there's this border I</span> <span data-start="244.01" data-end="246.32">just draw and I hit it pretty much and I</span> <span data-start="246.32" data-end="248.38">cannot do anything about it right and</span> <span data-start="248.38" data-end="250.52">developers is saying yeah you know the</span> <span data-start="250.52" data-end="252.98">web is open so actually you can change</span> <span data-start="252.98" data-end="255.11">it and then yeah I cannot fork the web</span> <span data-start="255.11" data-end="256.82">from github and just change it right and</span> <span data-start="256.82" data-end="259.549">so but what you can do is you either</span> <span data-start="259.549" data-end="261.44">jump on his back or you propose some</span> <span data-start="261.44" data-end="263.51">ideas or what you also can do is you</span> <span data-start="263.51" data-end="265.67">just grab a browser from github yeah you</span> <span data-start="265.67" data-end="268.19">implement things there and once it ships</span> <span data-start="268.19" data-end="269.72">in that browser and it's good auto</span> <span data-start="269.72" data-end="271.58">browser stopped it becomes back and</span> <span data-start="271.58" data-end="274.55">everybody's happy so that's what i doing</span> <span data-start="274.55" data-end="279.29">and love peace and everybody am so sorry</span> <span data-start="279.29" data-end="281.19">for slightly wrong thing</span> <span data-start="281.19" data-end="284.25">and so the question might be and should</span> <span data-start="284.25" data-end="286.05">developers it all makes packs because</span> <span data-start="286.05" data-end="288.66">that's what it boils down to right if</span> <span data-start="288.66" data-end="290.52">you want to change things at the end you</span> <span data-start="290.52" data-end="293.16">got to come up with spec and I think no</span> <span data-start="293.16" data-end="295.38">developer should not make spec because</span> <span data-start="295.38" data-end="297.6">writing spec is this kind of putting</span> <span data-start="297.6" data-end="299.85">natural language in mathematical way</span> <span data-start="299.85" data-end="302.04">that nobody can misinterpret is it and</span> <span data-start="302.04" data-end="304.92">it s complicated sounds it is I guess</span> <span data-start="304.92" data-end="308.31">there are only very few people that has</span> <span data-start="308.31" data-end="310.68">this kind of crazy mindless where they</span> <span data-start="310.68" data-end="312.39">understand where there's really small</span> <span data-start="312.39" data-end="315.48">pitfalls so who of um read the M</span> <span data-start="315.48" data-end="317.28">scripting specifications or at least</span> <span data-start="317.28" data-end="320.61">parts of it okay so I kind of go to our</span> <span data-start="320.61" data-end="322.95">example but basically there if you look</span> <span data-start="322.95" data-end="325.02">at it things look trivial to you but</span> <span data-start="325.02" data-end="327.6">it's really like seven or eight steps we</span> <span data-start="327.6" data-end="330.03">precise defined what's happening you</span> <span data-start="330.03" data-end="331.98">think yeah come on it doesn't have to be</span> <span data-start="331.98" data-end="333.75">that way but it turns out if you would</span> <span data-start="333.75" data-end="335.94">not people would end up in implementing</span> <span data-start="335.94" data-end="338.01">things differently and that hurts so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="338.01" data-end="340.23">Yuri got to be precise and developers as</span> <span data-start="340.23" data-end="342.45">good a they are then I heard don't have</span> <span data-start="342.45" data-end="345.27">this kind of madness so but the other</span> <span data-start="345.27" data-end="347.07">thing is should've watched propose ideas</span> <span data-start="347.07" data-end="349.5">and that's definitely yes because</span> <span data-start="349.5" data-end="351.75">developers are two people that interact</span> <span data-start="351.75" data-end="353.4">which browser all day and they come with</span> <span data-start="353.4" data-end="356.64">this new kind of ideas from outside some</span> <span data-start="356.64" data-end="360.81">some let's say agency gets a job and the</span> <span data-start="360.81" data-end="362.1">person there doesn't know the website it</span> <span data-start="362.1" data-end="363.87">just want something to happen and he</span> <span data-start="363.87" data-end="365.43">doesn't care if it's possible or not so</span> <span data-start="365.43" data-end="367.14">it just thinks out of the brow of the</span> <span data-start="367.14" data-end="370.53">box then developers is ok now I got to</span> <span data-start="370.53" data-end="372.75">implement it's impossible what if there</span> <span data-start="372.75" data-end="374.07">would be blah blah blah and we could do</span> <span data-start="374.07" data-end="377.91">it and so he would maybe face there is a</span> <span data-start="377.91" data-end="380.25">issue he can recognize it and then make</span> <span data-start="380.25" data-end="381.99">some kind of proposal to implement this</span> <span data-start="381.99" data-end="384.51">back out of it and that's actually part</span> <span data-start="384.51" data-end="386.43">of what I'm going to talk to and should</span> <span data-start="386.43" data-end="388.669">add the workers also implement a thing</span> <span data-start="388.669" data-end="391.86">well if you want to I mean it's open</span> <span data-start="391.86" data-end="393.45">source the browser's are open source so</span> <span data-start="393.45" data-end="395.88">you can do and I can't talk a little bit</span> <span data-start="395.88" data-end="398.97">in in my talk about how to make sure</span> <span data-start="398.97" data-end="400.95">this won't end up as a big pain for you</span> <span data-start="400.95" data-end="404.97">and to make sure you want to basically</span> <span data-start="404.97" data-end="407.55">fill this gap about suppose bus and we</span> <span data-start="407.55" data-end="410.43">all make a new API is in a better place</span> <span data-start="410.43" data-end="412.35">on the web so a little bit back from of</span> <span data-start="412.35" data-end="414.75">me and I worked on Bespin so we invert</span> <span data-start="414.75" data-end="418.2">colors so it's awesome icons and a it</span> <span data-start="418.2" data-end="420.96">then got into a so is the editors it's</span> <span data-start="420.96" data-end="423.03">powering cloud nine you'll see you use</span> <span data-start="423.03" data-end="426.69">cloud nine okay or not let that manage</span> <span data-start="426.69" data-end="429.63">much and then hacked on firefox then web</span> <span data-start="429.63" data-end="432.57">console stuff developer tools and then I</span> <span data-start="432.57" data-end="434.4">got to the eth I'm studying physics in</span> <span data-start="434.4" data-end="437.25">my fifth and bachelor degree in physics</span> <span data-start="437.25" data-end="442.38">and then I started working on PDF GS</span> <span data-start="442.38" data-end="445.14">which should be here on up yeah and so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="445.14" data-end="447.81">PDF GS is actually a good offering you</span> <span data-start="447.81" data-end="451.26">know PDF jas okay that's more so PDF</span> <span data-start="451.26" data-end="454.29">chase is just it's just a website and</span> <span data-start="454.29" data-end="456.33">this is actually just an iframe and it</span> <span data-start="456.33" data-end="458.52">just loads so just to demonstrate it</span> <span data-start="458.52" data-end="460.35">more I reload and it loads and you can</span> <span data-start="460.35" data-end="462.63">do selection and it looks pretty stupid</span> <span data-start="462.63" data-end="464.64">now with invert colors but the thing is</span> <span data-start="464.64" data-end="467.01">and we really want to have this as a</span> <span data-start="467.01" data-end="468.9">native thing so it also means we need to</span> <span data-start="468.9" data-end="471.81">do printing and actually printing on the</span> <span data-start="471.81" data-end="475.62">web is not as good as it could be but we</span> <span data-start="475.62" data-end="477.3">have to do it because we want to have</span> <span data-start="477.3" data-end="478.74">native experience and come in the</span> <span data-start="478.74" data-end="481.68">browser so what I worked on is new spec</span> <span data-start="481.68" data-end="483.3">for the canvas element that basically</span> <span data-start="483.3" data-end="484.8">lets you define the comp you are</span> <span data-start="484.8" data-end="486.96">printing and also means that what you</span> <span data-start="486.96" data-end="490.47">draw actually stays a vector format so</span> <span data-start="490.47" data-end="492.21">you see we can zoom in and it's still</span> <span data-start="492.21" data-end="493.86">text it's not register us and you also</span> <span data-start="493.86" data-end="496.38">can copy this kinds of things so that's</span> <span data-start="496.38" data-end="499.68">pretty cool and it's gone solved if a</span> <span data-start="499.68" data-end="501.99">lot of problems i guess but i won't go</span> <span data-start="501.99" data-end="503.28">into this because what i want to</span> <span data-start="503.28" data-end="506.85">concentrate on is how what how could you</span> <span data-start="506.85" data-end="509.669">maybe do these kind of things so i was</span> <span data-start="509.669" data-end="512.25">working on printing and try to choose</span> <span data-start="512.25" data-end="514.95">off this so first idea was can we use</span> <span data-start="514.95" data-end="516.57">maybe as we cheat to solve the problem</span> <span data-start="516.57" data-end="519.15">and we did some research and we proving</span> <span data-start="519.15" data-end="522.06">it it doesn't work for us so we need</span> <span data-start="522.06" data-end="524.13">some new API to make printing work with</span> <span data-start="524.13" data-end="527.04">canvas element and I was young you know</span> <span data-start="527.04" data-end="530.04">and me was just like yep let's do this I</span> <span data-start="530.04" data-end="532.11">always want to do c++ see how the</span> <span data-start="532.11" data-end="534.14">browser works internally blah blah blah</span> <span data-start="534.14" data-end="536.67">so you might ask I'm almost a little</span> <span data-start="536.67" data-end="539.16">person some what is this gecko specific</span> <span data-start="539.16" data-end="542.55">what I'm if I'm bucket WebKit guys</span> <span data-start="542.55" data-end="544.98">should I leave this talk I think you</span> <span data-start="544.98" data-end="545.939">shouldn't</span> <span data-start="545.939" data-end="547.649">because what I'm going to tell you a</span> <span data-start="547.649" data-end="549.059">thing applies to other browsers as well</span> <span data-start="549.059" data-end="555.269">and so it's channel purpose I don't know</span> <span data-start="555.269" data-end="557.669">what is know so well let's get started</span> <span data-start="557.669" data-end="560.089">and so there are two things basically</span> <span data-start="560.089" data-end="562.829">how you can approach getting something</span> <span data-start="562.829" data-end="564.72">new in the end of the browser server and</span> <span data-start="564.72" data-end="566.339">first thing you have the idea and then</span> <span data-start="566.339" data-end="568.739">either you code something up which get</span> <span data-start="568.739" data-end="570.029">ships in browser and then you make a</span> <span data-start="570.029" data-end="572.579">spec or you make the idea it becomes us</span> <span data-start="572.579" data-end="575.399">back and you then it gets implemented in</span> <span data-start="575.399" data-end="577.139">our case we need this thing as soon as</span> <span data-start="577.139" data-end="579.119">possible because for a PDF chest should</span> <span data-start="579.119" data-end="582.089">be as soon as possible the default PDF</span> <span data-start="582.089" data-end="584.999">viewer in Firefox so we said like here</span> <span data-start="584.999" data-end="587.519">we go with this idea we code it and if</span> <span data-start="587.519" data-end="590.129">it's good enough we relaunch it I'll</span> <span data-start="590.129" data-end="592.169">make it this back so the first thing if</span> <span data-start="592.169" data-end="594.299">you come up with a new idea and you will</span> <span data-start="594.299" data-end="596.579">proposes it's basically do research to</span> <span data-start="596.579" data-end="599.939">check or whether something else that's</span> <span data-start="599.939" data-end="601.109">the thing already on the web platform</span> <span data-start="601.109" data-end="603.809">because the cool thing about web is and</span> <span data-start="603.809" data-end="606.539">everything is only made once and there's</span> <span data-start="606.539" data-end="610.079">not too much duplication and and maybe</span> <span data-start="610.079" data-end="612.119">there's some bizarre way how you can do</span> <span data-start="612.119" data-end="614.519">the thing you're looking for in it just</span> <span data-start="614.519" data-end="615.869">takes a lot of time to make specs that</span> <span data-start="615.869" data-end="619.009">there's no need no sense to do twice and</span> <span data-start="619.009" data-end="621.749">also when you have some kind of Eid make</span> <span data-start="621.749" data-end="623.339">a sanity check if it makes sense for the</span> <span data-start="623.339" data-end="626.759">web runtime and so one thing maybe you</span> <span data-start="626.759" data-end="628.379">would want to implement an API that</span> <span data-start="628.379" data-end="630.599">makes unicorns from your flowering and</span> <span data-start="630.599" data-end="632.849">flying around and makes your name but</span> <span data-start="632.849" data-end="634.619">that doesn't make sense or you want to</span> <span data-start="634.619" data-end="637.799">make cross script origin request but it</span> <span data-start="637.799" data-end="639.269">doesn't make sense for security reasons</span> <span data-start="639.269" data-end="642.179">so then you would say well it's reaches</span> <span data-start="642.179" data-end="643.699">la possible on the browser because</span> <span data-start="643.699" data-end="645.899">security is the thing the browser</span> <span data-start="645.899" data-end="648.749">spilled onto ok so let's say you have</span> <span data-start="648.749" data-end="650.489">some kind of aid year there's this kind</span> <span data-start="650.489" data-end="653.009">of use case you have so then you would</span> <span data-start="653.009" data-end="655.169">do an API draft and which is basically</span> <span data-start="655.169" data-end="657.799">you think about what should be in there</span> <span data-start="657.799" data-end="660.179">what is the use case that you want to</span> <span data-start="660.179" data-end="661.679">solve so it should be use case driven</span> <span data-start="661.679" data-end="663.929">and that you say this this is on my</span> <span data-start="663.929" data-end="667.679">cases and the API need to have this kind</span> <span data-start="667.679" data-end="671.999">of scope that we can solve it and then</span> <span data-start="671.999" data-end="673.859">if you think about an API and you come</span> <span data-start="673.859" data-end="675.959">up with it you should try to keep it</span> <span data-start="675.959" data-end="678.899">small simple and general purpose</span> <span data-start="678.899" data-end="681.029">and thus malden API then easier to</span> <span data-start="681.029" data-end="683.43">implement and to specify and if it's</span> <span data-start="683.43" data-end="685.35">simple and other people couldn't use it</span> <span data-start="685.35" data-end="687.089">as well and general purpose is always</span> <span data-start="687.089" data-end="689.339">good for web because you might have</span> <span data-start="689.339" data-end="691.199">other ideas and if it's just too</span> <span data-start="691.199" data-end="692.759">specific for one use case it's not</span> <span data-start="692.759" data-end="695.129">useful but when its general purposes you</span> <span data-start="695.129" data-end="696.749">can reuse it for our stuff as well on</span> <span data-start="696.749" data-end="700.199">web then if you have some kind of API</span> <span data-start="700.199" data-end="702.779">you might want to pro type it or a cart</span> <span data-start="702.779" data-end="705.42">right some trim code so just write some</span> <span data-start="705.42" data-end="709.22">code as if the API would exist and then</span> <span data-start="709.22" data-end="712.199">see if it makes sense because just you</span> <span data-start="712.199" data-end="714.149">have an idea in your mind and not really</span> <span data-start="714.149" data-end="716.48">done any kind of code writing and</span> <span data-start="716.48" data-end="718.619">sometimes remiss leads you and if you</span> <span data-start="718.619" data-end="720.029">just write some code it's actually in</span> <span data-start="720.029" data-end="723.569">running but still there and it's pretty</span> <span data-start="723.569" data-end="725.91">good and to make check where this all</span> <span data-start="725.91" data-end="728.309">words and then you want to put your</span> <span data-start="728.309" data-end="731.399">documentation and the API draft avion</span> <span data-start="731.399" data-end="733.86">somewhere on the web gist github wiki</span> <span data-start="733.86" data-end="736.439">whatever and you want to share it</span> <span data-start="736.439"

data-end="748.47">you missed something the research part</span> <span data-start="748.47" data-end="752.759">and maybe there's an easy way to do the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="752.759" data-end="755.37">API maybe some pitfalls security issues</span> <span data-start="755.37" data-end="757.649">and once you have some feedback and you</span> <span

data-end="780.179">get idea out there may be some some</span> <span data-start="780.179" data-end="783.629">simple things and so the proposal maybe</span> <span data-start="783.629"

just</span> <span data-start="905.66" data-end="907.82">called in they have public meetings and</span> <span data-start="907.82" data-end="911.27">ask hey why is there no no no response</span> <span

data-end="1093.46">the thing that you want to implement API</span> <span data-start="1093.46" data-end="1097">is reviewed by somebody else and because</span> <span data-start="1097" data-end="1098.32">otherwise you might implement something</span> <span data-start="1098.32" data-end="1100.299">you spend like a month and then you like</span> <span data-start="1100.299" data-end="1102.669">here's a code um if they say what's just</span> <span data-start="1102.669" data-end="1106.33">not useful and it's just them yeah it</span> <span data-start="1106.33"

data-end="1118.39">it there's some kind Hall of pain i</span> <span data-start="1118.39" data-end="1121.15">called it so some best practices that i</span> <span data-start="1121.15" data-end="1122.95">came up to which would have made me or</span> <span data-start="1122.95" data-end="1125.32">made my life easier so one thing is find</span> <span data-start="1125.32"

data-end="1137.53">started like how is this working what's</span> <span data-start="1137.53" data-end="1139.21">the best practice for this and if you</span> <span data-start="1139.21" data-end="1140.62">have kind of mentor that you can</span> <span data-start="1140.62" data-end="1144.7">approach it's pretty good to make the</span> <span data-start="1144.7" data-end="1146.41">mentor might be a person that responds</span> <span data-start="1146.41" data-end="1149.38">to your API proposal and or you just ask</span> <span data-start="1149.38" data-end="1153.1">on IRC channel for

help</span> <span data-start="1156.52" data-end="1159.309">you with doing that and mostly there's</span> <span data-start="1159.309" data-end="1161.679">at least one person in each kind of</span>

data-end="1194.86">and the other thing is ask before i get</span> <span data-start="1194.86" data-end="1196.9">the press so it's pretty simple to just</span> <span data-start="1196.9" data-end="1198.85">sit in your room in code and it doesn't</span> <span data-start="1198.85" data-end="1201.94">work because c++ and whatever and what i</span> <span data-start="1201.94" data-end="1203.62">figured out it's it's way better if you</span> <span data-start="1203.62" data-end="1205.96">just ask a small question on IRC and</span> <span data-start="1205.96"

data-end="1211.68">going working</span> <span data-start="1211.68" data-end="1213.33">and some other thing is that you can</span> <span data-start="1213.33" data-end="1215.61">look up lots of talks and wikis out</span> <span data-start="1215.61" data-end="1217.29">there so forget CO and WebKit there's</span> <span data-start="1217.29" data-end="1219.63">tons how tooling works if there's</span> <span data-start="1219.63" data-end="1222.66">similar code similar box and like if you</span> <span data-start="1222.66" data-end="1224.58">do canvas implementation there's a lot</span> <span data-start="1224.58" data-end="1226.11">of bugs about canvas and how it got</span> <span data-start="1226.11" data-end="1227.64">implement so this might give seen</span> <span data-start="1227.64" data-end="1229.47">feeling which code parts you got to look</span> <span data-start="1229.47" data-end="1231.54">into and also gives you feeling about</span> <span data-start="1231.54"

data-end="1238.62">dogs may be so I mean this is not this</span> <span data-start="1238.62" data-end="1241.47">is not the glory of how you really do it</span> <span data-start="1241.47" data-end="1244.05">it's more like an idea maybe what would</span> <span data-start="1244.05" data-end="1246.33">help you and so things you might want to</span> <span data-start="1246.33" data-end="1248.28">look up is build system because you want</span> <span data-start="1248.28" data-end="1250.44">to build the five Firefox of WebKit at</span> <span data-start="1250.44" data-end="1252.03">some point maybe how to manage</span> <span data-start="1252.03" data-end="1254.4">management is done internally they have</span> <span data-start="1254.4" data-end="1256.68">some kind of reference counting and then</span> <span data-start="1256.68" data-end="1258.96">there are internal trees representations</span> <span data-start="1258.96" data-end="1261.03">if you work on some kind of layout thing</span> <span data-start="1261.03" data-end="1262.98">there's a layout read as a few tree</span> <span data-start="1262.98" data-end="1264.87">there's content readers daikon distri</span> <span data-start="1264.87" data-end="1268.62">and so on and maybe just ask do any any</span> <span data-start="1268.62" data-end="1271.08">of these or whatever and then there are</span> <span data-start="1271.08" data-end="1272.64">also coding conventions that you should</span> <span data-start="1272.64" data-end="1274.74">look up and get a little bit used to and</span> <span data-start="1274.74" data-end="1277.86">also debugging turns out to be art at</span> <span data-start="1277.86" data-end="1280.92">least for Firefox and I could expect</span> <span data-start="1280.92" data-end="1283.5">this may be better for WebKit so for</span> <span data-start="1283.5" data-end="1286.65">instance a cheeky be and who knows what</span> <span data-start="1286.65" data-end="1291.48">she be chibi says for okay more so it's</span> <span data-start="1291.48" data-end="1293.97">a command line based debugger and</span> <span data-start="1293.97" data-end="1296.58">basically you type s you hit enter and</span> <span data-start="1296.58" data-end="1298.62">it steps to the next line so its depth</span> <span data-start="1298.62" data-end="1301.14">it's pretty dumb but it's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="1301.14" data-end="1303.96">thing to work with I found out and also</span> <span data-start="1303.96" data-end="1305.46">it's some kind of new tool that I</span> <span data-start="1305.46" data-end="1308.1">haven't played maybe otherwise printer</span> <span data-start="1308.1" data-end="1311.43">has helped me a lot because I'm I'm</span> <span data-start="1311.43" data-end="1312.78">person that needs to look at what</span> <span data-start="1312.78" data-end="1314.85">happens so I basically have wrote five</span> <span data-start="1314.85" data-end="1316.8">lines of code and 20 pin devs maybe but</span> <span data-start="1316.8" data-end="1321.3">it helped me and so the other thing is</span> <span data-start="1321.3" data-end="1324.33">you might get stuck and then if you get</span> <span data-start="1324.33" data-end="1326.61">stuck it's good to look out for what</span> <span data-start="1326.61" data-end="1328.23">kind of people could have me there so</span> <span data-start="1328.23" data-end="1330.99">good person to to a way good way to find</span> <span data-start="1330.99" data-end="1332.61">these other people is to go to your</span> <span data-start="1332.61" data-end="1335.25">mentor on r cos K I'm stuck in this area</span> <span data-start="1335.25" data-end="1336.75">what are the people I should approach to</span> <span data-start="1336.75" data-end="1338.43">and also ask when are they online</span> <span data-start="1338.43" data-end="1340.86">because it turns out they might be on</span> <span data-start="1340.86" data-end="1343.29">the west coast so if you think in this</span> <span data-start="1343.29" data-end="1344.67">timezone you should ping them in the</span> <span data-start="1344.67" data-end="1345.36">evening or</span> <span data-start="1345.36" data-end="1347.28">in Japan so in the morning all these</span> <span data-start="1347.28" data-end="1350.64">kind of things and also a good thing is</span> <span data-start="1350.64" data-end="1353.25">get some c++ book because you can then</span> <span data-start="1353.25" data-end="1355.65">just read chapter through okay now we do</span> <span data-start="1355.65" data-end="1357.77">the actual coding I got to speed up and</span> <span data-start="1357.77" data-end="1360.45">so one thing they come across maybe is</span> <span data-start="1360.45" data-end="1362.64">things don't work the way expect and it</span> <span data-start="1362.64" data-end="1364.14">turns sometimes I was it's just a known</span> <span data-start="1364.14" data-end="1365.58">bug in the platform since a long time</span> <span data-start="1365.58" data-end="1367.74">and you try to fix it because you think</span> <span data-start="1367.74" data-end="1369.15">you broke it but that's actually not the</span> <span data-start="1369.15" data-end="1371.67">case so just avoid it and say there is a</span> <span data-start="1371.67" data-end="1374.88">bug out on here and then sometimes you</span> <span data-start="1374.88" data-end="1376.71">come up why are you implementing there's</span> <span data-start="1376.71" data-end="1378.75">an issue with the API design so for</span> <span data-start="1378.75" data-end="1380.76">instance they the API we had worse at</span> <span data-start="1380.76" data-end="1383.19">the beginning a synchronous but turned</span> <span data-start="1383.19" data-end="1386.52">out that doesn't make sense so we change</span> <span data-start="1386.52" data-end="1388.38">the API but the thing to watch out is</span> <span data-start="1388.38" data-end="1390.99">there due to API chains with feed bag or</span> <span data-start="1390.99" data-end="1393.21">on the mailing list again such that our</span> <span data-start="1393.21" data-end="1395.1">people that follow the process can jump</span> <span data-start="1395.1" data-end="1399.059">into and help out there and try to get</span> <span

data-end="1414.69">is not my topic because it sounds a</span> <span data-start="1414.69" data-end="1416.04">little bit narrow minded then you just</span> <span data-start="1416.04" data-end="1418.23">stay on your thing but otherwise you</span> <span data-start="1418.23" data-end="1420.09">just spread out in there too much of</span> </p>

data-start="1441.24" data-end="1443.46">continue so i just looked at one line</span> <span data-start="1443.46" data-end="1445.29">say yeah do you call this kind of</span> <span data-start="1445.29" data-end="1447.9">function no i don't oh oh yeah now it</span> <span data-start="1447.9" data-end="1449.91">totally makes sense so every small thing</span> <span data-start="1449.91" data-end="1452.58">but if we get stuck we should try to</span> <span data-start="1452.58" data-end="1454.29">dump as much as information as you have</span> <span data-start="1454.29" data-end="1457.2">because it makes people easier to get</span> <span data-start="1457.2" data-end="1460.32">you going again and step back sometimes</span> <span data-start="1460.32" data-end="1463.41">so just take a break is the thing that</span> <span data-start="1463.41" data-end="1464.91">you make doesn't make sense we</span> <span data-start="1464.91" data-end="1467.46">implemented that worried maybe no fun</span> <span data-start="1467.46" data-end="1469.59">normal thing and don't question yourself</span> <span data-start="1469.59" data-end="1473.429">so I would say you're not dump it's just</span> <span data-start="1473.429" data-end="1476.669">a huge thing to hack a browser and just</span> <span data-start="1476.669" data-end="1478.62">this way it is so</span> <span data-start="1478.62" data-end="1481.29">now it comes landing these things and so</span> <span data-start="1481.29" data-end="1483.18">if you have some code is it's more or</span> <span data-start="1483.18" data-end="1485.07">less working in Parliament if make sure</span> <span data-start="1485.07" data-end="1486.63">you get in a feedback cycle as soon as</span> <span data-start="1486.63" data-end="1488.88">possible so attached some wipe which is</span> <span data-start="1488.88" data-end="1491.49">working process on a bug and ask</span> <span

data-end="1570.15">sometimes you got to split them up and</span> <span data-start="1570.15" data-end="1572.34">for reviewer the does the extra cool</span> <span data-start="1572.34" data-end="1574.95">thing look them up and request and also</span> <span data-start="1574.95" data-end="1576.84">don't hesitate to change the review</span> <span data-start="1576.84" data-end="1579.05">because sometimes don't out people are</span> <span data-start="1579.05" data-end="1583.11">too time-consuming and if you don't if</span> <span data-start="1583.11" data-end="1585">something unclear stated because words</span> <span data-start="1585" data-end="1586.44">if you just come new coding and cress</span> <span data-start="1586.44" data-end="1588.78">afterwards if something is unclear maybe</span> <span data-start="1588.78" data-end="1590.52">leave a comment in code to make sure you</span> <span data-start="1590.52" data-end="1592.11">don't forget about it I've got to speed</span> <span data-start="1592.11" data-end="1594.45">up even more so now landed assume your</span> <span data-start="1594.45" data-end="1595.83">patch plan it's the first thing to do is</span> <span data-start="1595.83" data-end="1597.809">the victory dance because it's pretty</span> <span data-start="1597.809" data-end="1599.13">awesome to get something in a browser</span> <span data-start="1599.13" data-end="1601.61">and it was made two months of work and</span> <span data-start="1601.61" data-end="1605.46">then expect fall out so crashes the the</span> <span data-start="1605.46" data-end="1607.14">word thing is you have something and you</span> <span data-start="1607.14" data-end="1608.64">worked on it and then you see ten people</span> <span data-start="1608.64" data-end="1610.62">crash because of your code but</span> <span data-start="1610.62" data-end="1612.3">that's normal i would say if you right</span> <span data-start="1612.3" data-end="1615.3">the first time and as somebody reviewed</span> <span data-start="1615.3" data-end="1617.4">your code you know it's not just your</span> <span data-start="1617.4" data-end="1621.09">fault that's usual and the thing is some</span> <span data-start="1621.09" data-end="1622.83">channel thing the key thing about</span> <span data-start="1622.83" data-end="1624.3">getting this thing done is come to in</span> <span data-start="1624.3" data-end="1626.37">communication so the thing is iris</span> <span data-start="1626.37" data-end="1628.26">emailing this phone to get the thing</span> <span data-start="1628.26" data-end="1630.39">that's most convenient for you if it's</span> <span data-start="1630.39" data-end="1632.88">more time soon spread the people work</span> <span data-start="1632.88" data-end="1635.4">with many smell quebecer if something's</span> <span data-start="1635.4" data-end="1637.62">i could really ask because otherwise get</span> <span data-start="1637.62" data-end="1639.87">can get terrible you might get kind of</span> <span data-start="1639.87" data-end="1642.57">these messages on IRC so you stayed here</span> <span data-start="1642.57" data-end="1645.3">newbie and then they gonna explain your</span> <span data-start="1645.3" data-end="1646.71">way more so people are really open to</span> <span data-start="1646.71" data-end="1649.83">want to help you if you communicate keep</span> <span data-start="1649.83" data-end="1651.72">it short precise and keep it down to the</span> <span data-start="1651.72" data-end="1653.61">arguments because everybody can only</span> <span data-start="1653.61" data-end="1656.73">handle a little bit of stuff and be open</span> <span data-start="1656.73" data-end="1658.89">for new tools like this testing things</span> <span data-start="1658.89" data-end="1661.26">and different time zones to keep in mind</span> <span data-start="1661.26" data-end="1663.51">and also this driving force that</span> <span data-start="1663.51" data-end="1665.4">basically you're maybe not you the</span> <span data-start="1665.4" data-end="1667.5">implementation but you ping people to</span> <span data-start="1667.5" data-end="1669.57">make sure things keep happening it's</span> <span data-start="1669.57" data-end="1671.88">time consuming and communicating the</span> <span data-start="1671.88" data-end="1673.35">open because other people can jump in</span> <span data-start="1673.35" data-end="1676.44">and help you and expect to be wrong he'd</span> <span data-start="1676.44" data-end="1678.54">never done this made before so it met it</span> <span data-start="1678.54" data-end="1680.28">and say okay I was wrong you were right</span> <span data-start="1680.28" data-end="1682.95">and this is the way we do it and you</span> <span data-start="1682.95" data-end="1684.48">won't get replies with any day because</span> <span data-start="1684.48" data-end="1685.83">these people are busy if you don't</span> <span data-start="1685.83" data-end="1687.36">really get a rebus within a week you</span> <span data-start="1687.36" data-end="1690.24">might want to follow up again so what's</span> <span data-start="1690.24" data-end="1691.86">the status on the API worked on its</span> <span data-start="1691.86" data-end="1693.69">proposal to what we see Manning list and</span> <span data-start="1693.69" data-end="1696.21">there's no feedback so if you really</span> <span data-start="1696.21" data-end="1698.46">want to help me and make me happy so</span> <span data-start="1698.46" data-end="1701.309">give the happy icon there please talk to</span> <span data-start="1701.309" data-end="1702.51">me if you're interested in printing on</span> <span data-start="1702.51" data-end="1705.33">the web make it better and maybe you got</span> <span data-start="1705.33" data-end="1708.33">some feedback there and so that's</span> <span data-start="1708.33" data-end="1710.25">supposed to be fun oh yeah so actually</span> <span data-start="1710.25" data-end="1712.29">and the cool thing is just something CD</span> <span data-start="1712.29" data-end="1714.66">internal so this is capping miss the sea</span> <span data-start="1714.66" data-end="1716.04">bass bass thing that I was talking about</span> <span data-start="1716.04" data-end="1718.53">before you really see how is happening</span> <span data-start="1718.53" data-end="1720.72">and it's crazy going on when it's</span> <span data-start="1720.72" data-end="1722.79">all calls into the c++ and you see it</span> <span data-start="1722.79" data-end="1724.41">what happens and then that goes up to</span> <span data-start="1724.41" data-end="1726.87">javascript again and so it's really cool</span> <span data-start="1726.87" data-end="1728.64">and you also see why things are slow</span> <span data-start="1728.64" data-end="1733.02">sometimes and yep any learn C++ wizard</span> <span data-start="1733.02" data-end="1734.76">school for some reasons you learn new</span> <span data-start="1734.76" data-end="1738.03">tools and there's a lot of fun community</span> <span data-start="1738.03" data-end="1740.13">so this way Mike chokes somewhat of</span> <span data-start="1740.13" data-end="1742.56">themselves and you learn a lot of</span> <span data-start="1742.56" data-end="1744.24">communication skills</span> <span data-start="1744.24" data-end="1746.13">you also if there are some small fixes</span> <span data-start="1746.13" data-end="1748.77">that need to be done in C++ you know how</span> <span data-start="1748.77" data-end="1751.26">to do it so you can do it and don't have</span> <span data-start="1751.26" data-end="1753.3">to like write transcript to avoid this</span> <span data-start="1753.3" data-end="1755.34">back because now which stuff into you</span> <span data-start="1755.34" data-end="1757.95">and also the cool thing is once you fix</span> <span data-start="1757.95" data-end="1760.05">something like that say firefox you're</span> <span data-start="1760.05" data-end="1762.51">good the code for WebKit doesn't look</span> <span data-start="1762.51" data-end="1764.07">too different maybe so you can fix it</span> <span data-start="1764.07" data-end="1766.52">back in WebKit as well way more simpler</span> <span data-start="1766.52" data-end="1769.89">it's please open source project browsers</span> <span data-start="1769.89" data-end="1772.14">and it ships two million users so yeah</span> <span data-start="1772.14" data-end="1775.26">it's kind of big impact thing and maybe</span> <span data-start="1775.26" data-end="1776.7">something you don't do in your normal</span> <span data-start="1776.7" data-end="1779.4">life and if you walk refuse because</span> <span data-start="1779.4" data-end="1781.35">these people you might talk to our CEO</span> <span data-start="1781.35" data-end="1783.51">may too they basically build the web big</span> <span data-start="1783.51" data-end="1785.88">parts of it and you can work with them</span> <span data-start="1785.88" data-end="1788.4">which is kind of okay that's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="1788.4" data-end="1791.97">so links and to be done I didn't have</span> <span data-start="1791.97" data-end="1794.28">time and but if you want to have links</span> <span data-start="1794.28" data-end="1795.99">so I have something in my mind just</span> <span data-start="1795.99" data-end="1798.12">follow me on twitter you know and I</span> <span data-start="1798.12" data-end="1800.76">gonna post the slides for flings thanks</span> <span data-start="1800.76" data-end="1803.01">keep rocking the open web and question</span> </p>
