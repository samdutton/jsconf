<p><span data-start="43.53" data-end="45.09">I think is important and I get asked</span> <span data-start="45.09" data-end="49.649">this all the time what is a Dom right so</span> <span data-start="49.649" data-end="54.12">the w3c and its infinite wisdom defines</span> <span data-start="54.12" data-end="56.64">it as the document object model or dom</span> <span data-start="56.64" data-end="58.44">is a platform and language neutral</span> <span data-start="58.44" data-end="60.6">interface that will allow programs and</span> <span data-start="60.6" data-end="62.73">scripts to dynamically access and update</span> <span data-start="62.73" data-end="64.769">the content structure and style of</span> <span data-start="64.769" data-end="68.369">documents I mean that's great but I'm</span> <span data-start="68.369" data-end="73.17">still I'm still confused right so when I</span> <span data-start="73.17" data-end="76.619">think of the Dom my mind immediately</span> <span data-start="76.619" data-end="80.82">goes to you know a browser so this is</span> <span data-start="80.82" data-end="85.83">the nodejs homepage and the image here</span> <span data-start="85.83" data-end="88.53">is the result of markup being turned</span> <span data-start="88.53" data-end="91.56">into a Dom being styled being run</span> <span data-start="91.56" data-end="94.77">through a reflow like engine and then</span> <span data-start="94.77" data-end="100.92">being rendered to an image so as an</span> <span data-start="100.92" data-end="104.43">example here's some markup it's the X</span> <span data-start="104.43" data-end="107.759">it's the TOC like the links the</span> <span data-start="107.759" data-end="109.86">navigation on the left hand of the page</span> <span data-start="109.86" data-end="113.7">and when the browser retrieves these or</span> <span data-start="113.7" data-end="116.28">when it retrieves the HTML it sends it</span> <span data-start="116.28" data-end="121.25">to a parser the parser is kind of like a</span> <span data-start="121.25" data-end="125.579">assembly line it takes raw material or</span> <span data-start="125.579" data-end="128.34">markup in this case and it turns it into</span> <span data-start="128.34" data-end="131.099">usable components which we know as a</span> <span data-start="131.099" data-end="133.06">tree of Dom nodes</span> <span data-start="133.06" data-end="136.519">by the way these are f-22s which and</span> <span data-start="136.519" data-end="143.12">they're awesome okay so after they get</span> <span data-start="143.12" data-end="146.45">turned into a dom tree as you can see up</span> <span data-start="146.45" data-end="148.61">here there's i've used a tool i don't</span> <span data-start="148.61" data-end="151.579">know if you can see that he's a tool</span> <span data-start="151.579" data-end="154.849">called HTML graph to graph the markup on</span> <span data-start="154.849" data-end="160.7">the no th node homepage it's kind of</span> <span data-start="160.7" data-end="162.379">interesting to see this whole this whole</span> <span data-start="162.379" data-end="166.79">tree visualize but the purpose of this</span> <span data-start="166.79" data-end="169.519">is to show that the navigation div the</span> <span data-start="169.519" data-end="171.769">purple note that the orange arrow is</span> <span data-start="171.769" data-end="175.959">pointing to is actually like parenting</span> <span data-start="175.959" data-end="180.26">this whole hand looking thing which is a</span> <span data-start="180.26" data-end="186.42">noel a bunch of li is a bunch of links</span> <span data-start="186.43" data-end="189.95">so why is this valuable what what is the</span> <span data-start="189.95" data-end="192.889">purpose of this basically there's no</span> <span data-start="192.889" data-end="195.109">more text manipulation you can't read</span> <span data-start="195.109" data-end="197.81">documents as a tree and you don't have</span> <span data-start="197.81" data-end="201.709">to write x things and just you can use</span> <span data-start="201.709" data-end="203.48">it programmatically as opposed to</span> <span data-start="203.48" data-end="208.04">packing ground manipulation is easier</span> <span data-start="208.04" data-end="210.199">because we now have the tools to you</span> <span data-start="210.199" data-end="213.829">know traverse the structure manipulating</span> <span data-start="213.829" data-end="217.129">nodes moving them changing them whatever</span> <span data-start="217.129" data-end="220.879">you want to do so this is also good</span> <span data-start="220.879" data-end="223.669">because it's a common paradigm the DOM</span> <span data-start="223.669" data-end="226.04">is everywhere it's in server-side</span> <span data-start="226.04" data-end="228.19">languages or server side of platforms</span> <span data-start="228.19" data-end="231.22">browsers I mean it's one of the most</span> <span data-start="231.22" data-end="235.099">common paradigms around I mean it's just</span> <span data-start="235.099" data-end="237.829">a tree and some functionality to</span> <span data-start="237.829" data-end="241.37">manipulate you know the notes so I'd</span> <span data-start="241.37" data-end="245.379">like now to dive into some of like the</span> <span data-start="245.379" data-end="247.4">implementations on server cited</span> <span data-start="247.4" data-end="255.049">platforms and see how they work so</span> <span data-start="255.049" data-end="259.88">basically every every server cited link</span> <span data-start="259.88" data-end="262.52">every server cited platform has at least</span> <span data-start="262.52" data-end="264.55">one Dom</span> <span data-start="264.55" data-end="267.2">the problem there are many problems with</span> <span data-start="267.2" data-end="271.19">these though a lot of them actually all</span> <span data-start="271.19" data-end="273.89">of them you can't execute JavaScript and</span> <span data-start="273.89" data-end="277.73">we all love JavaScript so the question</span> <span data-start="277.73" data-end="281">is what would you use these things for</span> <span data-start="281" data-end="284.63">and in general it's a lot of XML</span> <span data-start="284.63" data-end="291.83">processes XML manipulation there's</span> <span data-start="291.83" data-end="296.38">xmlrpc soap xpath xslt and these are</span> <span data-start="296.38" data-end="298.76">these are a lot of short-lived arms</span> <span data-start="298.76" data-end="303.35">right they they're not meant to live</span> <span data-start="303.35" data-end="305.84">longer than the time that it takes to</span> <span data-start="305.84" data-end="311.2">remake a request there's no window</span> <span data-start="311.2" data-end="313.91">there's no events so even if you had a</span> <span data-start="313.91" data-end="316.24">long running Dom you couldn't you know</span> <span data-start="316.24" data-end="319.07">wait for an event to happen and capture</span> <span data-start="319.07" data-end="321.71">or bubble it or whatever and they're</span> <span data-start="321.71" data-end="325.9">they're extremely hard to bootstrap and</span> <span data-start="325.9" data-end="328.73">again there is no JavaScript so this is</span> <span data-start="328.73" data-end="334.94">the xml and HTML rift which i don't see</span> <span data-start="334.94" data-end="337.58">as it's horrible like you should be able</span> <span data-start="337.58" data-end="339.89">to process HTML and have a headless</span> <span data-start="339.89" data-end="345.26">browser native to your platform so</span> <span data-start="345.26" data-end="348.38">markup is good we all know this it's by</span> <span data-start="348.38" data-end="350.39">far the most known language even</span> <span data-start="350.39" data-end="352.57">non-technical people know what markup is</span> <span data-start="352.57" data-end="354.44">even if they don't know you know the</span> <span data-start="354.44" data-end="356.99">intricate details of like CSS they still</span> <span data-start="356.99" data-end="361.16">know what you know tags do in some some</span> <span data-start="361.16" data-end="366.169">fashion and to prove my point many</span> <span data-start="366.169" data-end="371.51">people know what this does so how do we</span> <span data-start="371.51" data-end="375.26">fix this problem we must be compliant</span> <span data-start="375.26" data-end="380.559">with the w3c</span> <span data-start="380.569" data-end="383.419">many platforms make bootstrapping a Dom</span> <span data-start="383.419" data-end="386.909">extremely tedious and painful we need to</span> <span data-start="386.909" data-end="392.069">fix this they also don't they don't</span> <span data-start="392.069" data-end="394.649">execute JavaScript so if you include a</span> <span data-start="394.649" data-end="396.959">script tag it just treats it like a</span> <span data-start="396.959" data-end="404.399">normal Dom element so the ideal</span> <span data-start="404.399" data-end="406.879">implementation would actually be</span> <span data-start="406.879" data-end="410.129">scriptable like a regular browser you</span> <span data-start="410.129" data-end="412.919">would execute JavaScript in the context</span> <span data-start="412.919" data-end="416.459">of the platform and in the context of</span> <span data-start="416.459" data-end="419.219">the window so you could you know combine</span> <span data-start="419.219" data-end="421.259">both of these worlds and do some pretty</span> <span data-start="421.259" data-end="425.459">amazing stuff so as because or because</span> <span data-start="425.459" data-end="429.329">node actually runs in JavaScript we kind</span> <span data-start="429.329" data-end="432.389">of get some of this for free and we can</span> <span data-start="432.389" data-end="434.309">do things that other platforms can't</span> <span data-start="434.309" data-end="435.539">even consider because we can execute</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="435.539" data-end="439.379">JavaScript on both sides so what does</span> <span data-start="439.379" data-end="442.169">jess dom about a year ago I started</span> <span data-start="442.169" data-end="448.079">writing Jace Tom as a as a common as a</span> <span data-start="448.079" data-end="450.809">common J's implementation of the w3c Dom</span> <span data-start="450.809" data-end="454.019">spec I've kind of limited that down to</span> <span data-start="454.019" data-end="457.009">node specific there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="457.009" data-end="459.269">intricacies with you know loading files</span> <span data-start="459.269" data-end="463.319">and all this other stuff that hoarding</span> <span data-start="463.319" data-end="465.599">it is kind of a pain and it's not really</span> <span data-start="465.599" data-end="470.839">the primary focus right now</span> <span data-start="470.849" data-end="474.719">so what is jas Tom it's pour sur les</span> <span data-start="474.719" data-end="477.719">which means there's no parser I rely on</span> <span data-start="477.719" data-end="480.599">the community to you know implement</span> <span data-start="480.599" data-end="484.529">these parsers and it's it's basically</span> <span data-start="484.529" data-end="487.8">between the parser and the rendering</span> <span data-start="487.8" data-end="491.669">engine so it would be you know as shown</span> <span data-start="491.669" data-end="493.469">up here it's you know the parser adapter</span> <span data-start="493.469" data-end="495.779">which you know takes markup sends it to</span> <span data-start="495.779" data-end="497.61">a parser and then the parser actually</span> <span data-start="497.61" data-end="500.969">creates down for you then it's the dom</span> <span data-start="500.969" data-end="504.959">which is specified to a tee by the w3c</span> <span data-start="504.959" data-end="509.399">and it's also a small window like</span> <span data-start="509.399" data-end="511.199">implementation right now we have a bunch</span> <span data-start="511.199" data-end="514.769">of stubs but that will change also</span> <span data-start="514.769" data-end="516.479">something that I should mention is the</span> <span data-start="516.479" data-end="519.959">parsers in red up there there are three</span> <span data-start="519.959" data-end="522.93">of them and they go from order they go</span> <span data-start="522.93" data-end="526.259">in order from you know fast but very</span> <span data-start="526.259" data-end="533.089">strict to slower and they deal with more</span> <span data-start="533.089" data-end="535.38">messed up markup so if you wanted to</span> <span data-start="535.38" data-end="537.449">scrape you know the world wide web the</span> <span data-start="537.449" data-end="540.269">wild the wild web you would actually use</span> <span data-start="540.269" data-end="543">probably html5 the html5 parser but if</span> <span data-start="543" data-end="545.22">you if you're just trying to do XML you</span> <span data-start="545.22" data-end="549.6">probably use sex so what makes what</span> <span data-start="549.6" data-end="556.35">makes us great so the first thing that I</span> <span data-start="556.35" data-end="558.269">did when I was writing guess tom is I</span> <span data-start="558.269" data-end="561.42">got the test suite from w3c because it</span> <span data-start="561.42" data-end="564.72">is very important that we are w3c test</span> <span data-start="564.72" data-end="567.779">suite compliant right so right now we're</span> <span data-start="567.779" data-end="570.899">really close a hundred percent of level</span> <span data-start="570.899" data-end="575.009">1 level 2 and level 3 which is more XML</span> <span data-start="575.009" data-end="584.03">or passing you yeah</span> <span data-start="584.04" data-end="586.75">so jess Tom isn't done until all of</span> <span data-start="586.75" data-end="589.44">these levels are complete and it's fast</span> <span data-start="589.44" data-end="592.29">which we have some some problems with</span> <span data-start="592.29" data-end="595.06">but first off I want to explain what</span> <span data-start="595.06" data-end="596.529">these levels are because I get a lot of</span> <span data-start="596.529" data-end="598.87">questions about okay so what there's a</span> <span data-start="598.87" data-end="602.47">bunch of levels what do they do so level</span> <span data-start="602.47" data-end="605.44">1 is it has this core module and it</span> <span data-start="605.44" data-end="607.3">basically defines you know what a</span> <span data-start="607.3" data-end="609.519">document is what a node is what an</span> <span data-start="609.519" data-end="611.86">attribute list is all of this basic</span> <span data-start="611.86" data-end="616.66">stuff level 2 kind of splits it goes in</span> <span data-start="616.66" data-end="619.18">one direction xml so you have namespaces</span> <span data-start="619.18" data-end="621.73">and all all of that fun stuff and then</span> <span data-start="621.73" data-end="623.17">on the other direction it goes HTML</span> <span data-start="623.17" data-end="625.899">where you have you know anchors form</span> <span data-start="625.899" data-end="632.92">elements and it also implements or also</span> <span data-start="632.92" data-end="636.19">introduces events so you can have</span> <span data-start="636.19" data-end="638.29">capture and bubble and all the things</span> <span data-start="638.29" data-end="641.19">that you're familiar with in the browser</span> <span data-start="641.19" data-end="644.41">it's also jess tom is also extremely</span> <span data-start="644.41" data-end="649.18">easy to bootstrap as seen here I mean</span> <span data-start="649.18" data-end="651.43">it's for brevity it's I've split up the</span> <span data-start="651.43" data-end="654.04">lines but if you combined all of this it</span> <span data-start="654.04" data-end="656.37">would be one or three lines of code and</span> <span data-start="656.37" data-end="659.26">it's extremely easy to scrape pages or</span> <span data-start="659.26" data-end="660.94">you know load up your own markup and</span> <span data-start="660.94" data-end="667.12">manipulate it and it works one thing to</span> <span data-start="667.12" data-end="669.279">note about this example is that it does</span> <span data-start="669.279" data-end="671.649">not run external javascript so if you</span> <span data-start="671.649" data-end="675.279">have a script tag it will not fetch and</span> <span data-start="675.279" data-end="677.279">execute that JavaScript there are other</span> <span data-start="677.279" data-end="680.709">jsm methods for that there's a salvage</span> <span

data-end="1360.55">it out to another library have its own</span> <span data-start="1360.55" data-end="1363.34">test and maybe even you know go as far</span> <span data-start="1363.34" data-end="1365.41">as to provide different implementation</span> <span data-start="1365.41" data-end="1369.28">so you know it emulates IE or firefox or</span> <span data-start="1369.28"
