data-end="275.08">beginning in our example HTML file and</span> <span data-start="275.08" data-end="278.29">then everything else in sgml is known as</span> <span data-start="278.29"

data-end="286.24">and those are the two sorts of things</span> <span data-start="286.24" data-end="289.84">and this sounds really familiar because</span> <span data-start="289.84" data-end="291.61">this is what the first version of HTML</span> <span data-start="291.61" data-end="294.1">was SPECT against but this doesn't</span> <span data-start="294.1" data-end="296.44">really answer our question because there</span> <span data-start="296.44" data-end="298.63">is something that even precedes sgml</span> <span data-start="298.63" data-end="300.699">which is GML and both of them were</span> <span data-start="300.699" data-end="303.22">created by this person Charles Goldfarb</span> <span data-start="303.22" data-end="307.51">at IBM and he talks as early he talks</span> <span data-start="307.51" data-end="310.93">about talking about tags as early as</span> <span data-start="310.93" data-end="314.32">1969 as in the this like sentence</span> <span data-start="314.32" data-end="316.389">fragment where he talks about quote</span> <span data-start="316.389" data-end="318.82">using an unfilled in outline of tags as</span> <span data-start="318.82" data-end="320.53">a prompter from which to create a new</span> <span data-start="320.53" data-end="324.669">document and so this is where we sort of</span> <span data-start="324.669" data-end="328.21">first see the word tag resemble resemble</span> <span data-start="328.21" data-end="329.71">a thing that we would look we would look</span> <span data-start="329.71" data-end="332.02">at in HTML and recognize which is as a</span> <span data-start="332.02" data-end="334.419">container for data and if we were to</span> <span data-start="334.419" data-end="337.419">stop here this is what the chain would</span> <span data-start="337.419" data-end="340.389">look like and that's pretty short but we</span> <span data-start="340.389" data-end="342.37">can we can go further down the rabbit</span> <span data-start="342.37" data-end="345.37">hole and ask where did the tag the rid</span> <span data-start="345.37" data-end="347.91">of the usage of tag in 1969 come from</span> <span data-start="347.91" data-end="351.13">and this was easy when we were asking it</span> <span data-start="351.13" data-end="353.5">about HTML because there's a document</span> <span data-start="353.5" data-end="356.25">that tells us it's it's an sgml thing</span> <span data-start="356.25" data-end="359.169">but so far as I could find there was no</span> <span data-start="359.169" data-end="360.82">there was really no reference to where</span> <span data-start="360.82" data-end="362.789">the word tag came from in</span> <span data-start="362.789" data-end="365.97">in the original versions of GML and XML</span> <span data-start="365.97" data-end="367.349">which were developed alongside each</span> <span data-start="367.349" data-end="369.9">other and so in order to get at this</span> <span data-start="369.9" data-end="373.289">question I took I borrowed a page from</span> <span data-start="373.289" data-end="375.75">the field called etymology so let's talk</span> <span data-start="375.75" data-end="377.58">about that for a second</span> <span data-start="377.58" data-end="380.31">etymology is defined as the study of the</span> <span data-start="380.31" data-end="382.169">origin of words and the way in which</span> <span data-start="382.169" data-end="383.49">their meanings have changed their</span> <span data-start="383.49" data-end="386.61">history and so typically etymology is</span> <span data-start="386.61" data-end="390.09">used to study words through hundreds of</span> <span data-start="390.09" data-end="391.889">years or thousands of years of change</span> <span data-start="391.889" data-end="394.59">and so if we take the word cascade as in</span> <span data-start="394.59" data-end="397.289">cascading stylesheets then we can see</span> <span data-start="397.289" data-end="399.629">that it comes to English from this long</span> <span data-start="399.629" data-end="404.039">series of French Italian and Latin for</span> <span data-start="404.039" data-end="406.319">to fall and that makes sense because the</span> <span data-start="406.319" data-end="408.509">definitions are pretty related and that</span> <span data-start="408.509" data-end="410.58">it's actually pretty old word in English</span> <span data-start="410.58" data-end="412.59">coming in sometime in the mid s'en in</span> <span data-start="412.59" data-end="416.19">mid 17th century and so while this is a</span> <span data-start="416.19" data-end="418.83">much more involved process we can take a</span> <span data-start="418.83" data-end="421.229">cue from what etymologists and linguists</span> <span data-start="421.229" data-end="423.779">do here by trying to find the earliest</span> <span data-start="423.779" data-end="426.199">instance of the word tag in computing</span> <span data-start="426.199" data-end="431.43">and so in in trying to research this</span> <span data-start="431.43" data-end="433.529">question the earliest instance that I</span> <span data-start="433.529" data-end="436.8">can find it was credited to this person</span> <span data-start="436.8" data-end="441.479">emile leon post and post was a computer</span> <span data-start="441.479" data-end="444.56">scientist a or he was a mathematician</span> <span data-start="444.56" data-end="448.139">but he made sort of fundamental inroads</span> <span data-start="448.139" data-end="450.81">in theoretical computer science he was a</span> <span data-start="450.81"

data-end="460.83">introduced this idea of a tag system in</span> <span data-start="460.83" data-end="464.55">a paper in 1943 called formal reductions</span> <span data-start="464.55"

data-end="469.86">the whole paper it's useful to</span> <span data-start="469.86" data-end="472.62">understand what it's doing in order to</span> <span data-start="472.62" data-end="474.659">understand why why the why the word tag</span> <span data-start="474.659" data-end="477.629">is appropriate here so the paper itself</span> <span data-start="477.629" data-end="479.94">is describing a computational model for</span> <span data-start="479.94" data-end="482.759">producing words arbitrary words from</span> <span data-start="482.759" data-end="484.62">production rules and that sounds really</span> <span data-start="484.62" data-end="487.5">abstract and hand-wavy so here is a very</span> <span data-start="487.5" data-end="490.08">very minified example</span> <span data-start="490.08" data-end="492.72">if we have a if we have a very simple</span> <span data-start="492.72" data-end="494.729">alphabet that only
