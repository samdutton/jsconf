<p><span data-start="5.53" data-end="9.92">thanks everyone coming out I</span> <span data-start="9.93" data-end="11.52">that I was recently working on that I</span> <span data-start="11.52" data-end="14.01">was meant to solve a lot of like the</span> <span data-start="14.01" data-end="16.2">nitty-gritty annoying stuff that I have</span> <span data-start="16.2" data-end="17.61">to deal with on a day-to-day basis when</span> <span data-start="17.61" data-end="20.13">it comes to making projects go live so</span> <span data-start="20.13" data-end="21.57">one of the gentlemen here asked me you</span> <span data-start="21.57" data-end="23.34">know what is the dsl what does dsl stand</span> <span data-start="23.34" data-end="26.37">for its domain specific language so what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.37" data-end="29.85">I saw to do was write a custom language</span> <span data-start="29.85" data-end="32.07">that could describe and solve the</span> <span data-start="32.07" data-end="34.05">problems that I was facing on like day</span> <span data-start="34.05" data-end="37.29">to day basis so this all began with a</span> <span data-start="37.29" data-end="43.62">realization that i had that dad but this</span> <span data-start="43.62" data-end="46.05">is a villain programming is fun but</span> <span data-start="46.05" data-end="52.04">deployment it's not so much fun this is</span> <span data-start="52.04" data-end="54.27">when it comes to making a project go</span> <span data-start="54.27" data-end="56.399">live i found myself constantly running</span> <span data-start="56.399" data-end="58.17">into the same things again and again i</span> <span data-start="58.17" data-end="60.6">would zip up the project i'll copy</span> <span data-start="60.6" data-end="63.12">remotely i would ssh into the remote</span> <span data-start="63.12" data-end="65.94">machine somewhere unzip it run a setup</span> <span data-start="65.94" data-end="68.399">script do a health check and then repeat</span> <span data-start="68.399" data-end="70.5">and it got to the point where i just</span> <span data-start="70.5" data-end="72.5">thought to myself what if I could just</span> <span data-start="72.5" data-end="76.32">automate all of this so I thought about</span> <span data-start="76.32" data-end="79.409">the problem a lot and I came to a</span> <span data-start="79.409" data-end="83.49">solution that had two main pieces one is</span> <span data-start="83.49" data-end="85.68">a background process running on the</span> <span data-start="85.68" data-end="89.07">remote machine that would it would hook</span> <span data-start="89.07" data-end="91.17">into native file system events and then</span> <span data-start="91.17" data-end="93.659">one a change event was fired it would</span> <span data-start="93.659" data-end="95.939">look at a file that was recently added</span> <span data-start="95.939" data-end="99.27">search for a zip file unzip it and then</span> <span data-start="99.27" data-end="102.06">run a setup script the reason you would</span> <span data-start="102.06" data-end="103.35">need to have something remotely is</span> <span data-start="103.35" data-end="105.33">because without it you would have to do</span> <span data-start="105.33" data-end="107.04">a lot of manual things you'd have to ssh</span> <span data-start="107.04" data-end="109.65">directly in and run all the commands</span> <span data-start="109.65" data-end="112.11">which is something I'm sure many of you</span> <span data-start="112.11" data-end="113.49">have already done but I wanted to avoid</span> <span data-start="113.49" data-end="115.89">doing it because I just thought it was a</span> <span data-start="115.89" data-end="118.619">pain and as a developer I try to make my</span> <span data-start="118.619" data-end="121.17">life as easy as possible and as lazy as</span> <span data-start="121.17" data-end="123.15">possible so that's kind of where this</span> <span data-start="123.15" data-end="126.299">came from the second part is the setup</span> <span data-start="126.299" data-end="128.19">script itself which is basically a list</span> <span data-start="128.19" data-end="131.85">of instructions that would unbundle the</span> <span data-start="131.85" data-end="134.13">project and get it up and running so</span> <span data-start="134.13" data-end="136.5">just real quickly the demon process</span> <span data-start="136.5" data-end="140.82">itself for it to be consistent I thought</span> <span data-start="140.82" data-end="142.56">that the best way to do it was to have a</span> <span data-start="142.56" data-end="143.4">landing zone</span> <span data-start="143.4" data-end="145.23">then call a landing zone a directory</span> <span data-start="145.23" data-end="148.53">that was watched and whenever a file was</span> <span data-start="148.53" data-end="152.099">added it would look for a zip file unzip</span> <span data-start="152.099" data-end="154.86">it and then run the setup script a set</span> <span data-start="154.86" data-end="156.51">of script is where the dsl actually</span> <span data-start="156.51" data-end="158.31">comes in and it's where i decided to</span> <span data-start="158.31" data-end="162.18">have a little fun so this is the good</span> <span data-start="162.18" data-end="164.939">stuff now i could have easily placed a</span> <span data-start="164.939" data-end="166.319">shell script into the packaging call</span> <span data-start="166.319" data-end="168">today but i saw this as an opportunity</span> <span data-start="168" data-end="170.269">to write my own language and I took it</span> <span data-start="170.269" data-end="178.069">for science so why even do this at all</span> <span data-start="178.069" data-end="181.47">why even like constructed dsl is because</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="183.15">every project I would ever need to work</span> <span data-start="183.15" data-end="184.62">on would require a different setup a</span> <span data-start="184.62" data-end="186.569">different environment different entry</span> <span data-start="186.569" data-end="188.819">point so why not come up with a way to</span> <span data-start="188.819" data-end="191.7">extract all that way so I came up with</span> <span data-start="191.7" data-end="196.049">this is a very simple language now I'm</span> <span data-start="196.049" data-end="198.53">not going to spend time going into the</span> <span data-start="198.53" data-end="200.79">everything into the structure everything</span> <span data-start="200.79" data-end="202.23">about the structure and implementation</span> <span data-start="202.23" data-end="204.209">of computer programming computer</span> <span data-start="204.209" data-end="205.709">programming languages because there are</span> <span data-start="205.709" data-end="208.109">literally entire libraries folder things</span> <span data-start="208.109" data-end="211.47">that I don't know but what I do know for</span> <span data-start="211.47" data-end="214.709">sure is that to transform any language</span> <span data-start="214.709" data-end="216.299">to run on a machine you need a compiler</span> <span data-start="216.299" data-end="220.29">so I wrote myself a toy compiler to make</span> <span data-start="220.29" data-end="221.849">sure that this language ran and did what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="221.849" data-end="225.09">I wanted it to do so just to take you</span> <span data-start="225.09" data-end="227.73">through some of the basics so dave told</span> <span data-start="227.73" data-end="229.26">me that a lot of you guys are mid-level</span> <span data-start="229.26" data-end="230.549">and beyond so i don't i'm not going to</span> <span data-start="230.549" data-end="232.229">spend too much time on like the</span> <span data-start="232.229" data-end="233.489">nitty-gritty of what's going on but</span> <span data-start="233.489" data-end="236.34">every compiler has three basic parts and</span> <span data-start="236.34" data-end="238.739">you have the lexer the parser and the</span> <span data-start="238.739" data-end="241.859">evaluator the lexer is usually broken up</span> <span data-start="241.859" data-end="243.479">into something called a scanner and a</span> <span data-start="243.479" data-end="245.639">tokenizer but depending on which</span> <span data-start="245.639" data-end="248.04">distribution in which library or which</span> <span data-start="248.04" data-end="250.079">compiler you're using sometimes the</span> <span data-start="250.079" data-end="251.28">things are merged together sometimes</span> <span data-start="251.28" data-end="254.34">they're not I chose to write a separate</span> <span data-start="254.34" data-end="256.139">scanner and a separate tokenizer and</span> <span data-start="256.139" data-end="257.4">i'll go into what these things actually</span> <span data-start="257.4" data-end="261.18">do I know so the scanner is what breaks</span> <span data-start="261.18" data-end="265.349">the body of language into into lexemes</span> <span data-start="265.349" data-end="267.96">which are the basic building blocks of a</span> <span data-start="267.96" data-end="270.95">languages syntax so just as an example</span> <span data-start="270.95" data-end="274.169">you have just a snippet from the setup</span> <span data-start="274.169" data-end="275.129">script that I have</span> <span data-start="275.129" data-end="277.649">a task called task name and then its</span> <span data-start="277.649" data-end="280.919">commands so the leg seems there would be</span> <span data-start="280.919" data-end="283.709">just the string literal text and task</span> <span data-start="283.709" data-end="288.869">name colon left parentheses a newline</span> <span data-start="288.869" data-end="290.639">character and then whatever the sooner</span> <span data-start="290.639" data-end="293.909">shell script was the tokenizer reads</span> <span data-start="293.909" data-end="296.939">each like semen adds metadata and this</span> <span data-start="296.939" data-end="298.8">metadata is what corresponds to the</span> <span data-start="298.8" data-end="302.219">actual grammar of the language this is</span> <span data-start="302.219" data-end="304.229">important because the form that a</span> <span data-start="304.229" data-end="306.3">language takes and its structure are</span> <span data-start="306.3" data-end="310.169">actually two different things like try</span> <span data-start="310.169" data-end="311.399">to come up with a good example for this</span> <span data-start="311.399" data-end="313.709">and so if I was to use the English</span> <span data-start="313.709" data-end="316.349">sentence I went to the store english</span> <span data-start="316.349" data-end="319.139">grammar would break it down as subject</span> <span data-start="319.139" data-end="323.939">verb object so if I was to break it up</span> <span data-start="323.939" data-end="326.999">into lexemes the lexemes would be I went</span> <span data-start="326.999" data-end="329.459">and then to the store whereas the</span> <span data-start="329.459" data-end="331.069">metadata attached to them would be I</span> <span data-start="331.069" data-end="335.729">comma subject went comma verb and to the</span> <span data-start="335.729" data-end="338.249">store comma object so that's how you see</span> <span data-start="338.249" data-end="340.74">the grammar tied to the individual</span> <span data-start="340.74" data-end="343.979">lexemes and this becomes important later</span> <span data-start="343.979" data-end="346.289">on when you parse them into a meaningful</span> <span data-start="346.289" data-end="350.099">structure because the tokens don't</span> <span data-start="350.099" data-end="352.05">actually have any meaning by themselves</span> <span data-start="352.05" data-end="353.879">they only have meaning in the context of</span> <span data-start="353.879" data-end="356.699">other tokens so there's this kind of</span> <span data-start="356.699" data-end="359.339">like just alt aspect to something that I</span> <span data-start="359.339" data-end="360.539">found really cool when I was writing</span> <span data-start="360.539" data-end="363.479">this now the parser is what provides</span> <span data-start="363.479" data-end="365.789">that context it takes the tokens and</span> <span data-start="365.789" data-end="367.8">derives what program is called semantic</span> <span data-start="367.8" data-end="371.49">meaning and without I'm trying to throw</span> <span data-start="371.49" data-end="375.11">as little jargon at you as possible but</span> <span data-start="375.11" data-end="378.029">basically this is like what I was saying</span> <span data-start="378.029" data-end="380.309">before that each token can only have</span> <span data-start="380.309" data-end="382.529">real value when interpreted in the</span> <span data-start="382.529" data-end="386.789">context of other tokens so the parser</span> <span data-start="386.789" data-end="388.139">behaves more or less like a state</span> <span data-start="388.139" data-end="389.339">machine which is something I'm about to</span> <span data-start="389.339" data-end="391.889">go into but just to see now I totally</span> <span data-start="391.889" data-end="393.149">understand if I just throw a bunch of</span> <span data-start="393.149" data-end="394.469">code at you like it won't really make</span> <span data-start="394.469" data-end="397.11">any sense so please feel free to ask me</span> <span
