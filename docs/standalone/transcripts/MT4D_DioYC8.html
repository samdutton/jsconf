data-end="208.59">don't think it's self-evident that it</span> <span data-start="208.59" data-end="210.78">would be the case so I thought if we</span> <span data-start="210.78" data-end="212.64">talk

<span data-start="226.5" data-end="228.239">things you could say you could you could</span> <span data-start="228.239" data-end="231.39">cast at the feet of components is that</span> <span

<span data-start="250.049" data-end="253.2">developing these UIs I'm not convinced</span> <span data-start="253.2" data-end="256.7">that technological lines are necessarily</span> <span data-start="256.7" data-end="258.81">the concerns of which you should be</span> <span data-start="258.81" data-end="260.989">separating on</span> <span data-start="260.989" data-end="265.069">for me components are a better</span> <span data-start="265.069" data-end="266.569">separation concerns because they</span> <span data-start="266.569" data-end="268.61">encapsulate a unit of functionality

data-end="285.319">about encapsulation or at least like</span> <span data-start="285.319" data-end="287.18">about talking about a calculation is the</span> <span data-start="287.18" data-end="289.58">primary purpose of components is that</span> <span data-start="289.58" data-end="292.88">really emphasizes the importance of what</span> <span data-start="292.88" data-end="295.4">you call your components what you name</span> <span data-start="295.4" data-end="296.9">them and how you design them at what</span> <span data-start="296.9" data-end="299.21">their properties are and that to me is</span> <span data-start="299.21" data-end="302.539">the real benefit to working with this</span> <span data-start="302.539" data-end="305.419">stuff so let me show you what I mean if</span> <span data-start="305.419" data-end="308.389">you've got a button component here the</span> <span data-start="308.389" data-end="311.33">button component button class name</span> <span data-start="311.33" data-end="313.55">button renders out a button with a type</span> <span data-start="313.55" data-end="315.71">of submit and Parsa to the class name</span> <span data-start="315.71" data-end="317.15">now this is a react example but</span> <span data-start="317.15" data-end="319.94">obviously components are common</span> <span data-start="319.94" data-end="321.62">throughout every UI framework at the</span> <span data-start="321.62" data-end="323.27">moment so if you're not using react</span> <span data-start="323.27" data-end="324.59">hopefully you can translate these</span> <span data-start="324.59" data-end="326.24">examples all of the examples today will</span> <span data-start="326.24" data-end="328.669">be react so this is a pretty simple</span> <span data-start="328.669" data-end="331.07">component button the only thing that's</span> <span data-start="331.07" data-end="332.78">really doing is hiding the fact that</span> <span data-start="332.78" data-end="336.38">there's a default type of submit for me</span> <span data-start="336.38" data-end="338.81">if you wanted to make that button more</span> <span data-start="338.81" data-end="340.759">prominent Milton bigger or a different</span> <span data-start="340.759" data-end="343.009">color or something then you might add a</span> <span data-start="343.009" data-end="345.08">second class to it a primary class this</span> <span data-start="345.08" data-end="347.18">is sort of a been variation or modifier</span> <span data-start="347.18" data-end="349.61">rather that simply gets passed through</span> <span data-start="349.61" data-end="351.05">it doesn't change anything else about</span> <span data-start="351.05" data-end="353.33">the button just adds another class and</span> <span data-start="353.33" data-end="355.009">this is a sort of workflow I think that</span> <span data-start="355.009" data-end="356.81">a lot of us became quite comfortable</span> <span data-start="356.81" data-end="361.009">with and and doesn't scare us at all if</span> <span data-start="361.009" data-end="362.449">you look at another example where you</span> <span data-start="362.449" data-end="364.009">have to change the type of the button</span> <span data-start="364.009" data-end="366.259">but you also have to attach a class name</span> <span data-start="366.259" data-end="369.169">you get this sort of weird duplication</span> <span data-start="369.169"
