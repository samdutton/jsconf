<p><span data-start="10.219" data-end="13.92">so I wanted to talk today a little bit</span> <span data-start="13.92" data-end="16.59">about a proposal that I've been working</span> <span data-start="16.59" data-end="23.01">on sort of to hopefully give us a better</span> <span data-start="23.01" data-end="25.76">Dom API to work with in the browser</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="25.76" data-end="30">I've been working with different browser</span> <span data-start="30" data-end="33.44">vendors I've been working with Mozilla</span> <span data-start="33.44" data-end="36.6">the Internet Explorer team I've been and</span> <span data-start="36.6" data-end="38.969">I've been talking with the w3c about</span> <span data-start="38.969" data-end="41.969">coming up with a good API that we can</span> <span data-start="41.969" data-end="46.53">all work with so with the core of my</span> <span data-start="46.53" data-end="51.93">proposal centers around is the build</span> <span data-start="51.93" data-end="56.96">list no list is a highly underused</span> <span data-start="56.96" data-end="59.969">object in java javascript in the dom</span> <span data-start="59.969" data-end="63.989">right now you can get a no list in a</span> <span data-start="63.989" data-end="65.489">couple of ways you can get a no list but</span> <span data-start="65.489" data-end="67.74">if you want to do child nodes for</span> <span data-start="67.74" data-end="68.97">example child nodes will give you a no</span> <span data-start="68.97" data-end="71.13">list if you do get elements by tag name</span> <span data-start="71.13" data-end="72.57">that will give you a no list query</span> <span data-start="72.57" data-end="75.479">selector all I'll give you a no list and</span> <span data-start="75.479" data-end="76.86">all these no lists have sort of</span> <span data-start="76.86" data-end="78.75">different states some node lists or</span> <span data-start="78.75" data-end="80.49">static in that they're just they just</span> <span data-start="80.49" data-end="82.02">don't change like if you if you do query</span> <span data-start="82.02" data-end="83.81">selector all you'll just get back</span> <span data-start="83.81" data-end="87.15">spectively a glorified array that isn't</span> <span data-start="87.15" data-end="89.22">an array it's much less useful than an</span> <span data-start="89.22" data-end="92.85">array and that's not changing but if you</span> <span data-start="92.85" data-end="95.28">do get elements by tag name that's also</span> <span data-start="95.28" data-end="97.53">no list but it's updated live every</span> <span data-start="97.53" data-end="99.57">single time a new for example div comes</span> <span data-start="99.57" data-end="101.13">into the page that node list gets</span> <span data-start="101.13" data-end="105.689">updated dynamically there's also the</span> <span data-start="105.689" data-end="111.869">concept of HTML collection it's in it's</span> <span data-start="111.869" data-end="115.259">in a it was in the current specification</span> <span data-start="115.259" data-end="117.18">but it's also on html5 and it's not</span> <span data-start="117.18" data-end="119.43">really clear why htmlcollection exists</span> <span data-start="119.43" data-end="122.579">since it is just an old list but so we</span> <span data-start="122.579" data-end="124.02">have this kind of you know bastard child</span> <span data-start="124.02" data-end="125.969">existing here that really should be</span> <span data-start="125.969" data-end="128.399">killed off or something but anyway so</span> <span data-start="128.399" data-end="130.41">what I wanted to do is take this concept</span> <span data-start="130.41" data-end="132.569">of a know list which is kind</span> <span data-start="132.569" data-end="133.98">neutered right now it doesn't really</span> <span data-start="133.98" data-end="135.749">like I said it's a sort of an array that</span> <span data-start="135.749" data-end="137.37">doesn't really have any meat to it and</span> <span data-start="137.37" data-end="142.889">make it actually useful part of dom the</span> <span data-start="142.889" data-end="145.73">reason why i wanted to do this is that</span> <span data-start="145.73" data-end="150.019">this concept of that you see in a lot of</span> <span data-start="150.019" data-end="154.079">frameworks now it's a thing sort of</span> <span data-start="154.079" data-end="156.269">originated by what we did in jquery</span> <span data-start="156.269" data-end="158.519">originally which is effectively instead</span> <span data-start="158.519" data-end="160.29">of operation instead of operating on a</span> <span data-start="160.29" data-end="161.459">single element at a time</span> <span data-start="161.459" data-end="163.53">you operate simultaneously against sets</span> <span data-start="163.53" data-end="165.93">of elements and as it stands right now</span> <span data-start="165.93" data-end="167.25">the browser doesn't really provide a</span> <span data-start="167.25" data-end="170.099">mechanism for doing that so i wanted to</span> <span data-start="170.099" data-end="171.389">provide some abilities to make that</span> <span data-start="171.389" data-end="179.34">possible to start i i'm introducing a</span> <span data-start="179.34" data-end="182.939">new method called a create node list and</span> <span data-start="182.939" data-end="185.37">create no list of works are like create</span> <span data-start="185.37" data-end="188.219">element and other functions of that</span> <span data-start="188.219" data-end="191.219">nature and you can pass in an array of</span> <span data-start="191.219" data-end="194.579">nodes an object essentially any object</span> <span data-start="194.579" data-end="195.949">that kind of looks like an array of</span> <span data-start="195.949" data-end="207.239">nodes so you can pass in for example you</span> <span data-start="207.239" data-end="209.22">could pass them down and it would it</span> <span data-start="209.22" data-end="211.169">would understand it and turn that into a</span> <span data-start="211.169" data-end="214.29">node list as the output now effectively</span> <span data-start="214.29" data-end="216.959">what I define a know list as because</span> <span data-start="216.959" data-end="218.549">since up until this point there has been</span> <span data-start="218.549" data-end="221.04">no no definition of what a no list</span> <span data-start="221.04" data-end="223.229">should be it's just sort of this kind of</span> <span data-start="223.229" data-end="226.409">mysterious sort of list so what I say is</span> <span data-start="226.409" data-end="230.519">that a no list is you know has has these</span> <span data-start="230.519" data-end="232.949">properties for each individual node</span> <span data-start="232.949" data-end="234.419">that's contained in the in this</span> <span data-start="234.419" data-end="237.09">container has a length additionally all</span> <span data-start="237.09" data-end="238.829">the nodes are guaranteed to be in</span> <span data-start="238.829" data-end="241.739">document order so if you have a whole</span> <span data-start="241.739" data-end="244.259">bunch of elements in it they're all they</span> <span data-start="244.259" data-end="245.609">will always come out sorted in the</span> <span data-start="245.609" data-end="246.9">correct order in which they're in the</span> <span data-start="246.9" data-end="249.06">document additionally there will be no</span> <span data-start="249.06" data-end="251.759">duplicates so if you if you had multiple</span> <span data-start="251.759" data-end="253.979">if you if you passed in multiple</span> <span data-start="253.979" data-end="255.689">document bodies for example you would</span> <span data-start="255.689" data-end="259.38">only get one body back so this is sort</span> <span data-start="259.38" data-end="260.849">of set the ground rules I mean this is</span> <span data-start="260.849" data-end="263.43">this is pretty standard in that all the</span> <span data-start="263.43" data-end="264.659">all the node lists that you get right</span> <span data-start="264.659" data-end="266">now and</span> <span data-start="266" data-end="267.83">have these properties you know that they</span> <span data-start="267.83" data-end="270.229">work like this they all come back in</span> <span data-start="270.229" data-end="271.37">document order and they have no</span> <span data-start="271.37" data-end="274.639">duplicates so I just wanted to maintain</span> <span data-start="274.639" data-end="278.75">that state but the where the really</span> <span data-start="278.75" data-end="282.71">interesting stuff comes in is if if we</span> <span data-start="282.71" data-end="285.169">have this know list</span> <span data-start="285.169" data-end="286.909">that's coming from get on with my tag</span> <span data-start="286.909" data-end="289.46">name Korea selector etc and we have the</span> <span data-start="289.46" data-end="293.15">ability to create custom no lists we it</span> <span data-start="293.15" data-end="295.009">becomes really useful to be able to</span> <span data-start="295.009" data-end="297.699">extend then don't list prototype so</span> <span data-start="297.699" data-end="300.409">effectively when my proposal centers</span> <span data-start="300.409" data-end="302.569">around is extending the no list</span> <span data-start="302.569" data-end="304.31">prototype with a whole bunch of really</span> <span data-start="304.31" data-end="307.219">useful functionality that we can use in</span> <span data-start="307.219" data-end="312.199">web applications additionally if we</span> <span data-start="312.199" data-end="314.09">don't end up killing off HTML collection</span> <span data-start="314.09" data-end="315.62">we should make HTML collection and hear</span> <span data-start="315.62" data-end="317.569">it from note list because right now</span> <span data-start="317.569" data-end="319.069">they're kind of two separate things that</span> <span data-start="319.069" data-end="321.5">don't really inherit from each other</span> <span data-start="321.5" data-end="323.9">it's all really weird but but again I</span> <span data-start="323.9" data-end="325.009">think a channel collection should just</span> <span data-start="325.009" data-end="328.969">die so will you see HTML collection come</span> <span data-start="328.969" data-end="331.279">up is if you do like uh dot children</span> <span data-start="331.279" data-end="332.539">it's all from there like the old Dom</span> <span data-start="332.539" data-end="334.43">zero days like if you do document dot</span> <span data-start="334.43" data-end="337.639">forms document dot links you know stuff</span> <span data-start="337.639" data-end="339.159">like that that no one ever uses anymore</span> <span data-start="339.159" data-end="342.44">when some like crazy legacy apps but</span> <span data-start="342.44" data-end="347.84">that's all HTML collection so one of the</span> <span data-start="347.84" data-end="350.71">things that's really easy to implement</span> <span data-start="350.71" data-end="354.759">is is a training like functionality and</span> <span data-start="354.759" data-end="359.87">one of the concepts the way you get a</span> <span data-start="359.87" data-end="361.94">chaining like thing is that on the no</span> <span data-start="361.94" data-end="364.34">less prototype you introduce a create</span> <span data-start="364.34" data-end="366.8">note list method so that means from any</span> <span data-start="366.8" data-end="368.599">note from any note list you can do</span> <span data-start="368.599" data-end="370.159">another you can create another know list</span> <span data-start="370.159" data-end="372.44">and when you do that the parent node</span> <span data-start="372.44" data-end="373.909">will always point back to where it came</span> <span data-start="373.909" data-end="377.15">from so just as an example here so this</span> <span data-start="377.15" data-end="379.219">isn't it doesn't work right now but just</span> <span data-start="379.219" data-end="382.49">to show you as how it would work so for</span> <span data-start="382.49" data-end="383.93">example if you did if you've got the</span> <span data-start="383.93" data-end="386.719">child nodes and uh from the body element</span> <span data-start="386.719" data-end="389.479">and you asked for its parent node you</span> <span data-start="389.479" data-end="390.8">would get back to where it came from</span> <span data-start="390.8" data-end="394.009">so you so any know list that you get you</span> <span data-start="394.009" data-end="395.75">can always go back to where from from</span> <span data-start="395.75" data-end="397.969">whence it came so additionally for</span> <span data-start="397.969" data-end="399.15">example if you did</span> <span data-start="399.15" data-end="401.07">query selector all and then you did a</span> <span data-start="401.07" data-end="403.56">query selector all on the results set on</span> <span data-start="403.56" data-end="405.84">the no list you could always get back to</span> <span data-start="405.84" data-end="408.66">that original uh no list again so this</span> <span data-start="408.66" data-end="411.06">way you can very easily traverse through</span> <span data-start="411.06" data-end="414.27">these result sets and again so this is</span> <span data-start="414.27" data-end="417.3">something that doesn't work it yet but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="417.3" data-end="419.78">I've something I'm proposing</span> <span data-start="419.78" data-end="423.63">additionally on the so some of the</span> <span data-start="423.63" data-end="426.6">things I want to see on the node list</span> <span data-start="426.6" data-end="428.79">prototype or a whole bunch of array</span> <span data-start="428.79" data-end="430.98">methods there are bunch of things that</span> <span data-start="430.98" data-end="433.11">would be very very useful to be able to</span> <span data-start="433.11" data-end="435.27">use against no list so for example</span> <span data-start="435.27" data-end="437.25">different ways different ways of looping</span> <span data-start="437.25" data-end="440.19">so like if you only have like a for each</span> <span data-start="440.19" data-end="444.18">map filter all of those and and some of</span> <span data-start="444.18" data-end="446.64">the default built-in array methods like</span> <span data-start="446.64" data-end="449.28">sliced concat things of that nature</span> <span data-start="449.28" data-end="452.81">now all some of these like sliced concat</span> <span data-start="452.81" data-end="458.19">map and yeah there's a yeah slice can</span> <span data-start="458.19" data-end="460.77">catnap and filter will all return new</span> <span data-start="460.77" data-end="463.32">node lists as a result since they all</span> <span data-start="463.32" data-end="466.08">modified the node list in some way so</span> <span data-start="466.08" data-end="470.67">for example we said a query selector</span> <span data-start="470.67" data-end="474.81">home you know find all the divs and then</span> <span data-start="474.81" data-end="485.31">you know we map it so a map for each and</span> <span data-start="485.31" data-end="488.43">that and you have to come from that's</span> <span data-start="488.43" data-end="489.99">been a Firefox now for quite some time</span> <span data-start="489.99" data-end="491.85">and it's in a part of a construct five</span> <span data-start="491.85" data-end="495.39">so here we get me to say um give us all</span> <span data-start="495.39" data-end="498.72">the parent nodes of all the divs for</span> <span data-start="498.72" data-end="501.36">example so that's this is a an operation</span> <span data-start="501.36" data-end="503.63">that can't be achieved through normal</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="503.63" data-end="506.94">CSS traversal but it's something that we</span> <span data-start="506.94" data-end="512.17">could do using the power of JavaScript</span> <span data-start="512.18" data-end="515.91">okay so there's a whole bunch of</span> <span data-start="515.91" data-end="519.69">different methods that I want to</span> <span data-start="519.69" data-end="521.82">introduce and all these methods</span> <span data-start="521.82" data-end="525.06">typically end up what I say is then a</span> <span data-start="525.06" data-end="527.67">bleeding through to the elements</span> <span data-start="527.67" data-end="531.3">themselves so just as an example you</span> <span data-start="531.3" data-end="532.92">have traversal</span> <span data-start="532.92" data-end="536.459">so I showed an example of it so for</span> <span data-start="536.459" data-end="541.799">example if you do similar to what I</span> <span data-start="541.799" data-end="543.839">showed before so you could say get</span> <span data-start="543.839" data-end="552.799">elements by tag name and then say get</span> <span data-start="552.799" data-end="560.79">elements class name so I mean you get</span> <span data-start="560.79" data-end="562.589">you could effectively chain these</span> <span data-start="562.589" data-end="564.72">operations together because it doesn't</span> <span data-start="564.72" data-end="565.829">really make sense now because what</span> <span data-start="565.829" data-end="567.329">happens now is that were restricted to</span> <span data-start="567.329" data-end="570.209">using these methods only on either the</span> <span data-start="570.209" data-end="574.169">document or on an element and or in the</span> <span data-start="574.169" data-end="576.809">case of the query selector a document</span> <span data-start="576.809" data-end="580.109">fragment when it makes a lot of sense to</span> <span data-start="580.109" data-end="581.699">be able to use them against sets of</span> <span data-start="581.699" data-end="583.829">elements simultaneously so in this way</span> <span data-start="583.829" data-end="586.109">what we be doing is finding all the divs</span> <span data-start="586.109" data-end="588.779">that are on the page and then finding</span> <span data-start="588.779" data-end="592.109">all the elements the test class name in</span> <span data-start="592.109"

data-end="830.519">also implement the event interface so if</span> <span data-start="830.519" data-end="832.769">you do add event list or remove masoor</span> <span data-start="832.769"

data-end="847.199">the node list now the peers where things</span> <span data-start="847.199" data-end="848.759">start to get really interesting so since</span> <span data-start="848.759" data-end="851.639">we have this nice API for encapsulating</span> <span data-start="851.639" data-end="853.92">all this functionality we can actually</span> <span data-start="853.92" data-end="855.48">solve a whole bunch of really hard</span> <span data-start="855.48" data-end="858.93">problems namely there's two problems</span> <span data-start="858.93" data-end="859.86">that I think are particularly</span> <span data-start="859.86" data-end="862.079">interesting one is the problem of having</span> <span data-start="862.079" data-end="865.319">mutation events and also the problem of</span> <span data-start="865.319" data-end="869.16">good Dom security so if we so in the</span> <span data-start="869.16" data-end="870.66">case of mutation events for example</span> <span data-start="870.66" data-end="875.16">right now we browsers say some browsers</span> <span data-start="875.16" data-end="876.779">implement mutation events which allow</span> <span data-start="876.779" data-end="880.769">you to listen to a particular point in</span> <span data-start="880.769" data-end="882.19">the Dom tree</span> <span data-start="882.19" data-end="884.32">wait and see like when an attribute has</span> <span data-start="884.32" data-end="885.94">been modified in an element or when an</span> <span data-start="885.94" data-end="887.17">element has been inserted or removed</span> <span data-start="887.17" data-end="889.78">from the page it's all really slow and</span> <span data-start="889.78" data-end="891.88">because the problem is is that it's all</span> <span data-start="891.88" data-end="896.34">synchronous so like for example if you</span> <span data-start="896.34" data-end="899.17">if you in if you have to go through an</span> <span data-start="899.17" data-end="901.63">insert in 500 divs that's gonna trigger</span> <span data-start="901.63" data-end="904.42">500 events and each one there's gonna be</span> <span data-start="904.42" data-end="907.36">on each individual element it's a</span> <span data-start="907.36" data-end="909.31">fantastically slow and because the</span> <span data-start="909.31" data-end="912.19">browser's can't delay it there's no way</span> <span data-start="912.19" data-end="914.47">for them to optimize it so there was a</span> <span data-start="914.47" data-end="916.63">proposal there was a number of holes uh</span> <span data-start="916.63" data-end="921.19">that came out to try and fix mutation</span> <span data-start="921.19" data-end="924.04">events there's a page in the w3c site</span> <span data-start="924.04" data-end="925.81">where all the browser vendors proposed</span> <span data-start="925.81" data-end="928.75">made different proposals the only one I</span> <span data-start="928.75" data-end="930.94">felt that had some merit was one</span> <span data-start="930.94" data-end="935.26">proposed by the IE team and I didn't</span> <span data-start="935.26" data-end="937.33">like the the particulars but the one</span> <span data-start="937.33" data-end="939.07">thing I did like is that these the the</span> <span data-start="939.07" data-end="940.72">main change that they made was that they</span> <span data-start="940.72" data-end="942.82">made it asynchronous there is no longer</span> <span data-start="942.82" data-end="945.01">guarantee that the mutation events will</span> <span data-start="945.01" data-end="948.52">occur synchronously so I take that</span> <span data-start="948.52" data-end="951.85">concept and apply it here so what</span> <span data-start="951.85" data-end="957.25">happens is there's so at least in my</span> <span data-start="957.25" data-end="958.72">proposal like if you do create no list</span> <span data-start="958.72" data-end="961.39">for example the result that's coming</span> <span data-start="961.39" data-end="964.57">back from that will always be static the</span> <span data-start="964.57" data-end="967">live load live no list to begin with are</span> <span data-start="967" data-end="969.85">really kind of crazy I think every</span> <span data-start="969.85" data-end="972.1">browser vendor would appreciate if live</span> <span data-start="972.1" data-end="975.01">no list this didn't exist since it would</span> <span data-start="975.01" data-end="976.63">make things a whole lot faster it</span> <span data-start="976.63" data-end="977.89">wouldn't have to maintain trying to</span> <span data-start="977.89" data-end="980.5">maintain this day all over the place so</span> <span data-start="980.5" data-end="982.54">the way I counteract the existence of</span> <span data-start="982.54" data-end="985.54">these live no lists is there's a new</span> <span data-start="985.54" data-end="990.31">query method so for example here make it</span> <span data-start="990.31" data-end="998.13">a little bit bigger</span> <span data-start="998.14" data-end="1003.55">all right so so for example here we do</span> <span data-start="1003.55" data-end="1005.5">this is example I used earlier so we do</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1005.5" data-end="1007.09">Priya sector all day if we find all the</span> <span data-start="1007.09" data-end="1009.04">divs in the page and that we do a map</span> <span data-start="1009.04" data-end="1011.53">and we get all that all the parents of</span> <span data-start="1011.53" data-end="1013.69">those divs so again this is this is a</span> <span data-start="1013.69" data-end="1015.55">selector that this is a traversal that</span> <span data-start="1015.55" data-end="1018.04">you can't normally do with it's just</span> <span data-start="1018.04" data-end="1020.26">plain CSS this is something that you can</span> <span data-start="1020.26" data-end="1023.32">only do through script so then later on</span> <span data-start="1023.32" data-end="1025.96">in your code the pages obviously been</span> <span data-start="1025.96" data-end="1027.4">updated some new dibs that come into the</span> <span data-start="1027.4" data-end="1029.29">page or some some devs have been moved</span> <span data-start="1029.29" data-end="1030.97">around and they now have new parents you</span> <span data-start="1030.97" data-end="1033.1">want to get the current result set so</span> <span data-start="1033.1" data-end="1036.37">all you have to do is say a parent stock</span> <span data-start="1036.37" data-end="1039.72">query and this returns and the new</span> <span data-start="1039.72" data-end="1043.09">result set the new known list based upon</span> <span data-start="1043.09" data-end="1045.91">the previous results so the way it works</span> <span data-start="1045.91" data-end="1049.54">is it actually it goes back up through</span> <span data-start="1049.54" data-end="1053.17">the tree so each individual method that</span> <span data-start="1053.17" data-end="1056.41">modifies the state you know that</span> <span data-start="1056.41" data-end="1058.12">modifies to no less that returns a new</span> <span data-start="1058.12" data-end="1061">node list so for example here creator</span> <span data-start="1061" data-end="1065.26">selector all is modified such that any</span> <span data-start="1065.26" data-end="1067.09">at any point it's possible to go back</span> <span data-start="1067.09" data-end="1070.09">and we query again yeah so we could just</span> <span data-start="1070.09" data-end="1074.83">say if we do a very crew something like</span> <span data-start="1074.83" data-end="1078.49">this we say odd divs and then we can do</span> <span data-start="1078.49" data-end="1085.93">like we do an interval and then every 13</span> <span data-start="1085.93" data-end="1090.34">milliseconds you know we query and do</span> <span data-start="1090.34" data-end="1092.38">something on those divs and and this</span> <span data-start="1092.38" data-end="1094.51">will give us the new result set and all</span> <span data-start="1094.51" data-end="1096.94">we query those results so in the same</span> <span data-start="1096.94" data-end="1101.2">way what's that modify those it returns</span> <span data-start="1101.2" data-end="1104.14">a new one it does not modify so that</span> <span data-start="1104.14" data-end="1105.37">that's a bit that's a big thing is that</span> <span data-start="1105.37" data-end="1106.9">none of the methods that I proposed and</span> <span data-start="1106.9" data-end="1110.26">modify the list itself it's it's not</span> <span data-start="1110.26" data-end="1111.97">immutable but at least that's just good</span> <span data-start="1111.97" data-end="1114.19">practice there's not not — I think</span> <span data-start="1114.19" data-end="1115.15">that's what like one of the things that</span> <span data-start="1115.15" data-end="1116.95">was that's was done very wrong like we</span> <span data-start="1116.95" data-end="1119.62">have like dot reverse for example in the</span> <span data-start="1119.62" data-end="1122.68">array API and that modifies and like</span> <span data-start="1122.68" data-end="1124.18">just stuff like that that this was just</span> <span data-start="1124.18" data-end="1127.36">wrong okay so we can do the query so not</span> <span data-start="1127.36" data-end="1128.95">only does the query we run the previous</span> <span data-start="1128.95" data-end="1130.419">sector all but also we runs</span> <span data-start="1130.419" data-end="1132.609">map again and anything else you've</span> <span data-start="1132.609" data-end="1134.95">you've changed along the way so in this</span> <span data-start="1134.95" data-end="1136.659">way you can get you can always get the</span> <span data-start="1136.659" data-end="1138.549">new result set and when you run the</span> <span data-start="1138.549" data-end="1140.049">query you don't have to know what those</span> <span data-start="1140.049" data-end="1142.09">original steps were to get the result</span> <span data-start="1142.09" data-end="1156.34">result</span> <span data-start="1156.35" data-end="1158.99">yes yeah that's exactly what it's doing</span> <span data-start="1158.99" data-end="1161">internally is that you know internally</span> <span data-start="1161" data-end="1163.97">all what it's doing is saying it goes</span> <span data-start="1163.97" data-end="1165.409">back to this step it goes back to the</span> <span data-start="1165.409" data-end="1167.029">map step and it says do you have a</span> <span data-start="1167.029" data-end="1169.37">parent that can be query okay go to the</span> <span data-start="1169.37" data-end="1170.72">parent first then it says do you have a</span> <span data-start="1170.72" data-end="1173.029">parent that you need query is this no it</span> <span data-start="1173.029" data-end="1174.74">runs this query then it goes back down</span> <span data-start="1174.74" data-end="1178.12">again so it's recursive in that way so</span> <span data-start="1178.12" data-end="1180.86">but the nice thing so now we have a way</span> <span data-start="1180.86" data-end="1184.7">to we query a result set we can add in</span> <span data-start="1184.7" data-end="1187.549">events so we can add in an added and</span> <span data-start="1187.549"
