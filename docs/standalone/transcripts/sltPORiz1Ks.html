<p><span data-start="237.63" data-end="241.62">Adobe Analytics a storybook react route</span> <span data-start="241.62" data-end="246">so this is very opinionated set of tools</span> <span data-start="246" data-end="249.54">and with the framework so I will just go</span> <span data-start="249.54" data-end="255.45">through the the generate the app</span> <span data-start="255.45" data-end="259.89">structure in detail so this is how our</span> <span data-start="259.89" data-end="263.25">app structure looks like where we have</span> <span data-start="263.25" data-end="266.76">the route reducer action saga and test</span> <span data-start="266.76" data-end="269.76">where we have the components inside the</span> <span data-start="269.76" data-end="272.49">app and inside the components we have</span> <span data-start="272.49" data-end="276.54">reducer action saga and test so this is</span> <span data-start="276.54" data-end="278.67">how typically a app structure looks like</span> <span data-start="278.67" data-end="280.77">and it's standard across all the</span> <span data-start="280.77" data-end="283.05">products that we use and developers are</span> <span data-start="283.05" data-end="285.53">very comfortable with this structure and</span> <span data-start="285.53" data-end="288.27">they can easily identify what they write</span> <span data-start="288.27" data-end="291.89">and how they need to document it and</span> <span data-start="291.89" data-end="295.41">this is the coolest thing that we built</span> <span data-start="295.41" data-end="298.5">the two generators one is AB generator</span> <span data-start="298.5" data-end="301.23">and UI generator so app generator is</span> <span data-start="301.23" data-end="304.38">basically like you just give a command</span> <span data-start="304.38" data-end="308.07">and it will ask you to — it will</span> <span data-start="308.07" data-end="310.82">generate in the boilerplate and</span> <span data-start="310.82" data-end="313.77">developers can straightaway right start</span> <span data-start="313.77" data-end="315.87">writing the business requirements so</span> <span data-start="315.87" data-end="318.52">even inside this app</span> <span data-start="318.52" data-end="322.65">we have the generator for models routes</span> <span data-start="322.65" data-end="326.49">a lot of things there inside there so</span> <span data-start="326.49" data-end="329.86">developers are free to use or they can</span> <span data-start="329.86" data-end="332.919">create the the structure acutely with</span> <span data-start="332.919" data-end="335.259">this generators with this couple of</span> <span data-start="335.259" data-end="337.479">commands and the other ECU I generator</span> <span data-start="337.479" data-end="340.78">so this is based on the this is for the</span> <span data-start="340.78" data-end="343.169">components so we have defined a</span> <span data-start="343.169" data-end="345.28">boilerplate for building reusable</span> <span data-start="345.28" data-end="347.05">components so it's standard across the</span> <span data-start="347.05" data-end="350.41">the products and it's also defined the</span> <span data-start="350.41" data-end="352.509">component structures and how you should</span> <span data-start="352.509" data-end="357.759">document it so I will just go through</span> <span data-start="357.759" data-end="359.949">the the number third is the UI component</span> <span data-start="359.949" data-end="364.15">libraries so UI component libraries we</span> <span data-start="364.15" data-end="367.389">use storybook internally to build the</span> <span data-start="367.389" data-end="369.069">presentation components where it is</span> <span data-start="369.069" data-end="371.889">reusable across product projects and</span> <span data-start="371.889" data-end="374.259">hardened through open collaboration with</span> <span data-start="374.259" data-end="375.94">the design and the business teams and</span> <span data-start="375.94" data-end="378.34">it's configurable to suit a range of</span> <span data-start="378.34" data-end="381.52">intended use cases and the good thing is</span> <span data-start="381.52" data-end="385.78">it's t-mobile and thanks to storybook</span> <span data-start="385.78" data-end="388.24">for recognizing us along with other tech</span> <span data-start="388.24" data-end="392.229">giants and thanks and I would like to</span> <span data-start="392.229" data-end="395.4">just present like what how does our</span> <span data-start="395.4" data-end="398.32">component libraries looks like so these</span> <span data-start="398.32" data-end="401.919">are the couple of the component</span> <span data-start="401.919" data-end="404.37">libraries that we use in channel II and</span> <span data-start="404.37" data-end="406.84">we have the libraries for the internet</span> <span data-start="406.84" data-end="409.479">banking your forms and everything is</span> <span data-start="409.479" data-end="411.63">documented well so that Bella preserve</span> <span data-start="411.63" data-end="416.409">this can easily use this modules in</span> <span data-start="416.409" data-end="418.81">their products and we use the semantic</span> <span data-start="418.81" data-end="423.159">version to upgrade each libraries but</span> <span data-start="423.159" data-end="425.349">how we achieve all these things and how</span> <span data-start="425.349" data-end="429.88">we implemented this in our products so</span> <span data-start="429.88" data-end="433.33">that's a challenging part but this this</span> <span data-start="433.33" data-end="436">is the the thing that we want to also</span> <span data-start="436" data-end="439.03">highlight and share principles that we</span> <span data-start="439.03" data-end="444.009">follow so number one is no reinvent so</span> <span data-start="444.009" data-end="445.75">given that all the production like ready</span> <span data-start="445.75" data-end="447.479">libraries are built by the community</span> <span data-start="447.479" data-end="450.639">there is no benefit to build by our own</span> <span data-start="450.639" data-end="453.22">so in-house library</span> <span data-start="453.22" data-end="456.4">tend not to cover in a fuse cases and we</span> <span data-start="456.4" data-end="459.97">find it hard to get up to date so you</span> <span data-start="459.97" data-end="462.22">introduce only minimal libraries if</span> <span data-start="462.22" data-end="465.88">required and number two reduce choices</span> <span data-start="465.88" data-end="468.25">we have too many libraries in the NPM</span> <span data-start="468.25" data-end="470.71">and developers often confuse to choose</span> <span data-start="470.71" data-end="473.32">the right libraries and these are all</span> <span data-start="473.32" data-end="475.21">that all time consuming and not</span> <span data-start="475.21" data-end="476.17">productive</span> <span data-start="476.17" data-end="478.18">so using this Falcon framework that we</span> <span data-start="478.18" data-end="480.76">built the product in term product team</span> <span data-start="480.76" data-end="483.67">can focus on building things that brings</span> <span data-start="483.67" data-end="486.63">valid to the business and our three</span> <span data-start="486.63" data-end="489.69">standard guidelines so we defined</span> <span data-start="489.69" data-end="492.79">recommended application layout structure</span> <span data-start="492.79" data-end="495.12">components to bring consistent</span> <span data-start="495.12" data-end="497.2">development and production environment</span> <span data-start="497.2" data-end="500.14">to the product teams based on our data</span> <span data-start="500.14" data-end="502.72">we also defined the browser support</span> <span data-start="502.72" data-end="505.9">policy for where we want to build our</span> <span data-start="505.9" data-end="508.24">product to the trajector customers not</span> <span data-start="508.24" data-end="511.57">just to the something that is not</span> <span data-start="511.57" data-end="514.36">relevant to a customer and number four</span> <span data-start="514.36" data-end="516.94">is the flexible so we were we don't want</span> <span data-start="516.94" data-end="519.64">to limit teams potential instead we want</span> <span data-start="519.64" data-end="522.22">to encourage team to find a better way</span> <span data-start="522.22" data-end="525.64">to improve together also also although</span> <span data-start="525.64" data-end="527.32">this contradict with our opinion two</span> <span data-start="527.32" data-end="529.33">choices most of the team preferred</span> <span data-start="529.33" data-end="531.37">decisions made for them so that they can</span> <span data-start="531.37" data-end="537.84">focus on building products so apart</span> <span data-start="537.84" data-end="541.42">apart from the benefits so I would like</span> <span data-start="541.42" data-end="543.79">to share the results what we have</span> <span data-start="543.79" data-end="546.58">observed or what we have got through</span> <span data-start="546.58" data-end="552.37">this journey so we and if I'd that there</span> <span data-start="552.37" data-end="554.83">is a drastic decrease in time to first</span> <span data-start="554.83" data-end="557.64">meaningful pane for product remake and</span> <span data-start="557.64" data-end="560.62">the second is we work very closely with</span> <span data-start="560.62" data-end="565.03">the design design and the business to</span> <span data-start="565.03" data-end="566.5">build the standardize component and</span> <span data-start="566.5" data-end="569.41">consistent experience so there's operon</span> <span data-start="569.41" data-end="572.74">collaboration and first iterations</span> <span data-start="572.74" data-end="578.53">between the the products and last happy</span> <span data-start="578.53" data-end="580.84">developers so we value our developers</span> <span data-start="580.84" data-end="583.52">and developers feel happy and confirm</span> <span data-start="583.52" data-end="585.11">working with the chord base and they</span> <span data-start="585.11" data-end="588.14">find it hard easier to add enhancement</span> <span data-start="588.14" data-end="591.05">to existing products and also easier</span> <span data-start="591.05" data-end="594.38">sprint planning since react is easily</span> <span data-start="594.38" data-end="598.76">composable so these are the things that</span> <span data-start="598.76" data-end="602.21">work for us just to recap so on this</span> <span data-start="602.21" data-end="605.02">digital product transformation to build</span> <span data-start="605.02" data-end="608.57">consistent user experience and high</span> <span data-start="608.57" data-end="610.85">quality products these are the things</span> <span data-start="610.85" data-end="611.99">that work for us</span> <span data-start="611.99" data-end="614.63">one is the app structure where it gives</span> <span data-start="614.63" data-end="617.92">the developers to develop or start</span> <span data-start="617.92" data-end="620.39">onboarding start onboarding the product</span> <span data-start="620.39" data-end="624.08">quickly and generators where app</span> <span data-start="624.08" data-end="626.12">generator and component charities help</span> <span data-start="626.12" data-end="628.43">us to kickstart development and also</span> <span data-start="628.43" data-end="631.06">enable us to have faster iteration and</span> <span data-start="631.06" data-end="633.8">number three is the UI component library</span> <span data-start="633.8"
