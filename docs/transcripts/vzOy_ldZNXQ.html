<p><span data-start="15.36" data-end="20.2">you</span> <span data-start="20.21" data-end="22.17">as we go mentioned I'm going to talk a</span> <span data-start="22.17" data-end="23.73">little bit today about how how we</span> <span data-start="23.73" data-end="26.82">interact with the web is changing I'm</span> <span data-start="26.82" data-end="28.11">going to do that just there's just a</span> <span data-start="28.11" data-end="29.04">start out I'm gonna start out with a</span> <span data-start="29.04" data-end="31.95">super mr. obvious slide and that is that</span> <span data-start="31.95" data-end="36.03">web mobile browsing is exploding the</span> <span data-start="36.03" data-end="38.25">interesting point though is that this</span> <span data-start="38.25" data-end="39.96">year there are more people browsing the</span> <span data-start="39.96" data-end="41.67">web with touch than there are we using</span> <span data-start="41.67" data-end="45.269">mouse and the other implication that may</span> <span data-start="45.269" data-end="47.07">not be really apparent is that people</span> <span data-start="47.07" data-end="49.559">are starting to use are using touch on</span> <span data-start="49.559" data-end="52.86">desktop as well so windows 8 now has</span> <span data-start="52.86" data-end="56.969">touch built-in and even you know</span> <span data-start="56.969" data-end="58.62">platforms like I'm going to have have</span> <span data-start="58.62" data-end="60.78">touched integrated into the platform and</span> <span data-start="60.78" data-end="62.67">so if you have a touch capable laptop</span> <span data-start="62.67" data-end="64.379">you can start using the web on your</span> <span data-start="64.379" data-end="66.24">desktop as well with touch and so this</span> <span data-start="66.24" data-end="67.95">curve I expect or the number of people</span> <span data-start="67.95" data-end="69.33">using the curve the implication of this</span> <span data-start="69.33" data-end="71.789">curve is that a number of people using</span> <span data-start="71.789" data-end="73.08">touch on the web is only going to</span> <span data-start="73.08" data-end="77.07">accelerate and so we did a lot of</span> <span data-start="77.07" data-end="78.99">research and what just really this talk</span> <span data-start="78.99" data-end="81.33">is about is the first part is a little</span> <span data-start="81.33" data-end="82.47">bit about the research we did with</span> <span data-start="82.47" data-end="83.67">surface and the second part is about</span> <span data-start="83.67" data-end="86.88">pointer events but but as part of doing</span> <span data-start="86.88" data-end="88.68">the the building the surface device we</span> <span data-start="88.68" data-end="90">did a lot of research and what was going</span> <span data-start="90" data-end="92.58">on on the web and I keep hoback you can</span> <span data-start="92.58" data-end="94.35">delete this slide because i think it's i</span> <span data-start="94.35" data-end="96.299">think probably for most people's is a</span> <span data-start="96.299" data-end="98.07">pretty elite audience this is pretty</span> <span data-start="98.07" data-end="99.57">obvious but there's things that stop</span> <span data-start="99.57" data-end="102">working when you win when you are using</span> <span data-start="102" data-end="104.7">the web in a touchable manner right so</span> <span data-start="104.7" data-end="107.549">when you hover is a terrible thing to</span> <span data-start="107.549" data-end="110.009">use and you have a touchable web it note</span> <span data-start="110.009" data-end="111.899">upstart not hover but hover hover menus</span> <span data-start="111.899" data-end="113.82">and things like that where the</span> <span data-start="113.82" data-end="115.35">interaction requires that you're able to</span> <span data-start="115.35" data-end="117.45">hover over a device or over an element</span> <span data-start="117.45" data-end="120.689">on the page when you're using you're</span> <span data-start="120.689" data-end="122.67">using the web page in a touch manner</span> <span data-start="122.67" data-end="124.71">that's impossible so some patterns like</span> <span data-start="124.71" data-end="126.93">this stop working and you need to think</span> <span data-start="126.93" data-end="129.149">about that which can sometimes be</span> <span data-start="129.149" data-end="130.739">challenging when you develop doing most</span> <span data-start="130.739" data-end="132.93">your goal and obviously on a laptop so</span> <span data-start="132.93" data-end="134.489">you need to reconsider which message are</span> <span data-start="134.489" data-end="136.35">using on the web as you develop for the</span> <span data-start="136.35" data-end="139.799">web for the touch another thing we did</span> <span data-start="139.799" data-end="142.65">is we did a lot of research on what's</span> <span data-start="142.65" data-end="147.019">the optimal touch target size so we</span> <span data-start="147.019" data-end="149.549">obviously a mouse has really fine</span> <span data-start="149.549" data-end="151.23">grained control over you know clicking</span> <span data-start="151.23" data-end="153.12">elements on the screen and obviously</span> <span data-start="153.12" data-end="153.99">touch doesn't</span> <span data-start="153.99" data-end="156.51">people have fingers of various sizes and</span> <span data-start="156.51" data-end="159">what we discovered is that we did we</span> <span data-start="159" data-end="160.47">need research that there is there people</span> <span data-start="160.47" data-end="162">had fingers that went from eight</span> <span data-start="162" data-end="164.28">millimeters all the way up to 19</span> <span data-start="164.28" data-end="166.74">millimeters with 11 millimeter adder</span> <span data-start="166.74" data-end="170.13">average basically and what we found is</span> <span data-start="170.13" data-end="173.01">that we use different touch target sizes</span> <span data-start="173.01" data-end="178.44">and we found that as the touch sighs got</span> <span data-start="178.44" data-end="181.47">below five millimeters people started to</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="183.78">make a lot more mistakes so that seems</span> <span data-start="183.78" data-end="185.58">to be a kind of the asymptotic kind of</span> <span data-start="185.58" data-end="187.83">curve and which you know people start to</span> <span data-start="187.83" data-end="190.26">have a lot more trouble using using your</span> <span data-start="190.26" data-end="192.42">website and it's not only if they have</span> <span data-start="192.42" data-end="194.37">more trouble clicking the target they</span> <span data-start="194.37" data-end="196.92">actually spend more time trying to zero</span> <span data-start="196.92" data-end="198.6">in on the target as well so those two</span> <span data-start="198.6" data-end="201.15">things combined together to be you know</span> <span data-start="201.15" data-end="203.31">to make it very much more difficult and</span> <span data-start="203.31" data-end="204.87">so what we discovered in that research</span> <span data-start="204.87" data-end="206.49">is that something between seven</span> <span data-start="206.49" data-end="209.13">millimeters and nine millimeters is kind</span> <span data-start="209.13" data-end="211.26">of an ideal touch target size and so</span> <span data-start="211.26" data-end="213.81">that's what that implies kind of depends</span> <span data-start="213.81" data-end="215.66">on the the density of the screen but</span> <span data-start="215.66" data-end="217.98">from a lot of the common screens right</span> <span data-start="217.98" data-end="219.9">now that's 40 to 50 pixels your touch</span> <span data-start="219.9" data-end="222.78">target should be in that range going</span> <span data-start="222.78" data-end="224.61">above that obviously is easier to touch</span> <span data-start="224.61" data-end="226.59">but then you start using up more screen</span> <span data-start="226.59" data-end="229.56">real estate for your touch targets so as</span> <span data-start="229.56" data-end="230.85">you design your applications you should</span> <span data-start="230.85" data-end="232.89">think about you know people using it for</span> <span data-start="232.89" data-end="234.21">touching that and making sure that touch</span> <span data-start="234.21" data-end="237.39">targets are the right size another part</span> <span data-start="237.39" data-end="238.44">that we did that not a part of the</span> <span data-start="238.44" data-end="239.94">researchers did with the surface was</span> <span data-start="239.94" data-end="241.68">looking at where tarts targets are</span> <span data-start="241.68" data-end="244.2">positioned and so those of you that are</span> <span data-start="244.2" data-end="246.45">have seen Windows and Windows 8 we have</span> <span data-start="246.45" data-end="249.3">this this this kind of this pattern</span> <span data-start="249.3" data-end="250.68">where we have things on the left and the</span> <span data-start="250.68" data-end="252.45">right that you can you can click and</span> <span data-start="252.45" data-end="254.46">this comes directly out of the research</span> <span data-start="254.46" data-end="257.01">on one where people's hands are and so</span> <span data-start="257.01" data-end="259.5">the green regions here are where it's</span> <span data-start="259.5" data-end="261.57">easy for people with with the smallest</span> <span data-start="261.57" data-end="263.76">hands to reach touch targets and as you</span> <span data-start="263.76" data-end="265.35">see it's kind of all run the it's in the</span> <span data-start="265.35" data-end="269.04">middle of the tablet it's did you know</span> <span data-start="269.04" data-end="270">obviously to the right and the left</span> <span data-start="270" data-end="273.69">usually and so for the touch targets</span> <span data-start="273.69" data-end="275.67">that you wanted your users to use the</span> <span data-start="275.67" data-end="277.62">most these are the best positions for</span> <span data-start="277.62" data-end="283.26">that you should you should have and you</span> <span data-start="283.26" data-end="285.479">know as things get more to the senator</span> <span data-start="285.479" data-end="286.8">to screen a big more difficult for</span> <span data-start="286.8" data-end="289.05">people to use and so when people at</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="289.05" data-end="290.31">Microsoft are thinking about building</span> <span data-start="290.31" data-end="291.84">building websites and building</span> <span data-start="291.84" data-end="294.3">applications we have this general kind</span> <span data-start="294.3" data-end="296.34">of set of guidelines and so the first</span> <span data-start="296.34" data-end="297.629">one kind of comes out of the last one</span> <span data-start="297.629" data-end="299.09">put your touch targets to the side</span> <span data-start="299.09" data-end="301.229">towards the middle if possible if it's a</span> <span data-start="301.229" data-end="305.009">static screen or doesn't scroll and on</span> <span data-start="305.009" data-end="306.93">the on the phone it's exactly the</span> <span data-start="306.93" data-end="308.099">opposite right so you're using your</span> <span data-start="308.099" data-end="311.069">thumb as opposed to fingers it's it's</span> <span data-start="311.069" data-end="313.11">the best interaction zone is actually in</span> <span data-start="313.11" data-end="315.449">the middle and so then you kind of flip</span> <span data-start="315.449" data-end="316.65">that around when you start thinking</span> <span data-start="316.65" data-end="318.06">about where the best areas are for</span> <span data-start="318.06" data-end="321.18">people to read things on on mobile</span> <span data-start="321.18" data-end="323.219">devices for the tablet it's it's it's</span> <span data-start="323.219" data-end="325.62">best up top their hands aren't obscuring</span> <span data-start="325.62" data-end="327.629">it they can you know that it's easier</span> <span data-start="327.629" data-end="329.129">from the read and the same thing on on</span> <span data-start="329.129" data-end="333.9">the phone as well and so you know people</span> <span data-start="333.9" data-end="336.599">bring expectations now you know the</span> <span data-start="336.599" data-end="339.81">explosion of apps in mobile and desktop</span> <span data-start="339.81" data-end="342.719">has brought expectations of what the you</span> <span data-start="342.719" data-end="344.819">know touch touchable apps mean to the</span> <span data-start="344.819" data-end="346.77">web as well and one thing that the web</span> <span data-start="346.77" data-end="349.379">really hasn't you know to date hasn't</span> <span data-start="349.379" data-end="351.449">kept up with is multi-touch so the</span> <span data-start="351.449" data-end="354.599">ability to have multiple pointer events</span> <span data-start="354.599" data-end="357.27">going on at once and so this has led us</span> <span data-start="357.27" data-end="360.389">in in in conjunction with Mozilla who's</span> <span data-start="360.389" data-end="362.31">been a great partner in his proposal to</span> <span data-start="362.31" data-end="363.93">propose to the w3c something called</span> <span data-start="363.93" data-end="366.9">pointer events and what the idea of</span> <span data-start="366.9" data-end="369.27">pointer events is is to evolve the</span> <span data-start="369.27" data-end="372.539">current Mouse events model to unify this</span> <span data-start="372.539" data-end="374.99">across the other types of point of</span> <span data-start="374.99" data-end="377.31">pointers that are available so we're</span> <span data-start="377.31" data-end="378.779">talking about mice are talking about</span> <span data-start="378.779" data-end="380.34">touch we're talking about pens and</span> <span data-start="380.34" data-end="381.99">things that we can't we don't even</span> <span data-start="381.99" data-end="387.569">haven't even dreamed up yet so this is</span> <span data-start="387.569" data-end="389.46">moved is to move very quickly through</span> <span data-start="389.46" data-end="393.569">the w3c it was a working draft and I</span> <span data-start="393.569" data-end="396.96">think March of this year I believe this</span> <span data-start="396.96" data-end="399.539">year and in five months it's been two</span> <span data-start="399.539" data-end="402.389">candidate recommendation the good news</span> <span data-start="402.389" data-end="404.669">is it's really an elbow volution so</span> <span data-start="404.669" data-end="406.59">we've taken what you already know from</span> <span data-start="406.59" data-end="409.65">mouse events and essentially have you</span> <span data-start="409.65" data-end="410.94">know there are more or less drop-in</span> <span data-start="410.94" data-end="412.65">replacements there's really only one</span> <span data-start="412.65" data-end="413.849">thing that we've added and that's</span> <span data-start="413.849" data-end="416.58">pointer cancel pointer cancel is an</span> <span data-start="416.58" data-end="418.32">event you get when someone changes an</span> <span data-start="418.32" data-end="419.63">orientation</span> <span data-start="419.63" data-end="422.3">or or a couple other scenarios where you</span> <span data-start="422.3" data-end="424.58">want to or accidental input that has</span> <span data-start="424.58" data-end="426.83">been detected by the device where you</span> <span data-start="426.83" data-end="428.27">want to cancel the inputs you want to</span> <span data-start="428.27" data-end="429.79">cancel this particular pointer event</span> <span data-start="429.79" data-end="432.38">otherwise it's more or less which you</span> <span data-start="432.38" data-end="435.56">expect these events from from you know</span> <span data-start="435.56" data-end="437.89">using Mouse events for many many years</span> <span data-start="437.89" data-end="440.15">what it does add is it adds more</span> <span data-start="440.15" data-end="441.29">attributes so I'm going to walk through</span> <span data-start="441.29" data-end="443.21">each of these in a little bit more</span> <span data-start="443.21" data-end="446.33">detail so it adds more the set of</span> <span data-start="446.33" data-end="447.89">attributes that are available on each</span> <span data-start="447.89" data-end="450.56">each event so that you can you can do</span> <span data-start="450.56" data-end="452.45">some you know much more richer</span> <span data-start="452.45" data-end="454.91">interaction model of with with touch and</span> <span data-start="454.91" data-end="456.92">other other pointer devices and so the</span> <span data-start="456.92" data-end="459.56">first one is the first set is is width</span> <span data-start="459.56" data-end="461.69">and height and this is the recognition</span> <span data-start="461.69" data-end="464.33">that a lot of pointer events beyond the</span> <span data-start="464.33" data-end="466.61">mouse have our point of devices beyond</span> <span data-start="466.61" data-end="468.71">the mouse have a real physical world</span> <span data-start="468.71" data-end="470.63">width and height right so when you put</span> <span data-start="470.63" data-end="472.28">your finger down on the screen depending</span> <span data-start="472.28" data-end="474.05">on how much you you're pressing on if</span> <span data-start="474.05" data-end="475.58">you're using your thumb or your index</span> <span data-start="475.58" data-end="477.23">finger it's going to have a different</span> <span data-start="477.23" data-end="479.36">geometry on the screen and so this</span> <span data-start="479.36" data-end="481.34">passes us through to your web app so you</span> <span data-start="481.34" data-end="483.08">have access to that and you can respond</span> <span data-start="483.08" data-end="487.16">appropriately you know likewise for some</span> <span data-start="487.16" data-end="490.4">devices and in particular the pen there</span> <span data-start="490.4" data-end="492.44">there you know it might be important to</span> <span data-start="492.44" data-end="496.42">have the pressure and a tilt that it's</span> <span data-start="496.42" data-end="499.34">that the deploying device is at this</span> <span data-start="499.34" data-end="500.69">allows you to do kind of stenographic</span> <span data-start="500.69" data-end="504.44">you know calligraphy style things with</span> <span data-start="504.44" data-end="507.11">the with the pen and so you can you can</span> <span data-start="507.11" data-end="509.27">reflect what the users real intention</span> <span data-start="509.27" data-end="514.82">was with using the device and finally</span> <span data-start="514.82" data-end="517.88">there's there's two other things you can</span> <span data-start="517.88" data-end="521.12">use so if you know most cases you</span> <span data-start="521.12" data-end="523.34">probably want to handle pointer devices</span> <span data-start="523.34" data-end="525.89">the same button you know in the case</span> <span data-start="525.89" data-end="527.3">that you don't you want to handle a pen</span> <span data-start="527.3" data-end="529.19">differently from a touch device or a</span> <span data-start="529.19" data-end="531.83">mouse you have the ability with pointer</span> <span data-start="531.83"

data-start="559.529" data-end="560.85">to jump out I'll jump in right now and</span> <span data-start="560.85" data-end="562.11">just show a little bit of code or how</span> <span data-start="562.11" data-end="565.5">this how this works and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="565.5" data-end="568.41">have to do that over here unfortunately</span> <span data-start="568.41" data-end="570.149">we have to do as little dance because my</span> <span data-start="570.149" data-end="571.92">screen is not actually high enough</span> <span data-start="571.92" data-end="574.68">resolution to do a 1080

<p><span data-start="574.68" data-end="578.04">I'm just sort of annoying get a new</span> <span data-start="578.04" data-end="582.839">laptop when I get back anyway so so what</span> <span data-start="582.839" data-end="583.889">I'm showing here is essentially i'm</span> <span data-start="583.889" data-end="585.12">going to build a finger painting</span> <span data-start="585.12" data-end="588.69">application so i'm using a canvas i'm</span> <span data-start="588.69" data-end="589.68">essentially there's a little bit of</span> <span data-start="589.68" data-end="593.73">boilerplate down here because in ie10 we</span> <span data-start="593.73" data-end="595.86">had a vendor prefixed implementation of</span> <span data-start="595.86" data-end="597.66">this and now it's shifted over to the</span> <span data-start="597.66" data-end="602.16">draft recommendation events but i've</span> <span data-start="602.16" data-end="603.569">been essentially in that canvas i'm</span> <span data-start="603.569" data-end="605.79">adding a set of event listeners so</span> <span data-start="605.79" data-end="607.44">there's a event listener for pointer</span> <span data-start="607.44" data-end="608.61">down and there's an event listener</span> <span data-start="608.61" data-end="611.79">pointer move and up and cancel and so on</span> <span data-start="611.79" data-end="613.949">and so what I'm going to do is I'm just</span> <span data-start="613.949" data-end="615.959">going to when there's a pointer down i'm</span> <span data-start="615.959" data-end="617.97">going to start paint and just to</span> <span data-start="617.97" data-end="620.04">initialize things I just have a list of</span> <span data-start="620.04" data-end="622.019">four points and so what I'm going to do</span> <span data-start="622.019" data-end="625.079">is as I move I'm going to paint along</span> <span data-start="625.079" data-end="627.12">that path so I just do a busy a curve</span> <span data-start="627.12" data-end="629.91">between those four points and we'll just</span> <span data-start="629.91" data-end="632.839">continue to do that as the user moves</span> <span data-start="632.839" data-end="637.319">and when I lift the when I lift or</span> <span data-start="637.319" data-end="639">cancel meeting an orientation change</span> <span data-start="639" data-end="641.61">usually I'll end the paint and it'll</span> <span data-start="641.61" data-end="644.31">stop the it clears this list essentially</span> <span data-start="644.31" data-end="647.97">and so if we look at you know how does</span> <span data-start="647.97" data-end="649.139">that how does that look how does that</span> <span data-start="649.139" data-end="659.86">work and I need to go off full screen</span> <span data-start="659.87" data-end="662.07">wait so I have to this is really</span> <span data-start="662.07" data-end="663.27">annoying but I have to come over here</span> <span data-start="663.27" data-end="664.8">actually do that no I can I can do with</span> <span data-start="664.8" data-end="667.41">the so i'll do the so i'll start out</span> <span data-start="667.41" data-end="668.73">with just the mouse so this is one</span> <span data-start="668.73" data-end="671.43">pointer event right now i'm going to do</span> <span data-start="671.43" data-end="672.63">this little dance over here and use my</span> <span data-start="672.63" data-end="674.4">touch screen on my laptop which is</span> <span data-start="674.4" data-end="677.28">really annoying but to do the same thing</span> <span data-start="677.28" data-end="679.44">so i just touched my laptop it's not</span> <span data-start="679.44" data-end="681.72">really a parent to you in this case but</span> <span data-start="681.72" data-end="682.95">essentially I drew on the screen as well</span> <span data-start="682.95" data-end="685.02">so we use two different prototypes they</span> <span data-start="685.02" data-end="686.46">reacted in a way that you know makes</span> <span data-start="686.46" data-end="688.32">sense it did you know essentially drew</span> <span data-start="688.32" data-end="690.21">the line followed the curve that we were</span> <span data-start="690.21" data-end="692.91">talking about the problem is and I can't</span> <span data-start="692.91" data-end="694.62">show this in real time is that if i use</span> <span data-start="694.62" data-end="697.92">both my fingers the way i've implemented</span> <span data-start="697.92" data-end="702.18">it it doesn't work right what happens is</span> <span data-start="702.18" data-end="704.25">it essentially jumps between the pointer</span> <span data-start="704.25" data-end="706.95">events in each of the the streams of</span> <span data-start="706.95" data-end="709.5">events were getting and so to fix that</span> <span data-start="709.5" data-end="710.97">essentially we just need to use the</span> <span data-start="710.97" data-end="713.7">pointer ID that i mentioned earlier so</span> <span data-start="713.7" data-end="715.62">with multi-touch essentially here's</span> <span data-start="715.62" data-end="718.95">another implementation of that and</span> <span data-start="718.95" data-end="720.81">essentially i'm just using now instead</span> <span data-start="720.81" data-end="722.46">of just having a single list i maintain</span> <span data-start="722.46" data-end="724.68">a list of points that we're going to</span> <span data-start="724.68" data-end="726.45">draw that curve between using you know</span> <span data-start="726.45" data-end="728.01">index by this pointer ID that you're</span> <span data-start="728.01" data-end="729.87">getting as part of the as part of the</span> <span data-start="729.87" data-end="732.39">pointer event and otherwise it's the</span> <span data-start="732.39" data-end="733.74">same implementation we're drawing the</span> <span data-start="733.74" data-end="735.81">curve through that that that set of</span> <span data-start="735.81" data-end="740.94">points and so if i go back and drag this</span> <span data-start="740.94" data-end="743.34">back over here and you have to trust me</span> <span data-start="743.34" data-end="745.98">that I'm using two fingers makes you can</span> <span data-start="745.98" data-end="748.32">tell now there's different colors now</span> <span data-start="748.32" data-end="751.65">that's handled correctly and actually</span> <span data-start="751.65" data-end="754.14">manage those as two separate streams of</span> <span data-start="754.14" data-end="757.74">points that it's drawing but you know</span> <span data-start="757.74" data-end="759.42">what cinching about this is is still the</span> <span data-start="759.42" data-end="761.34">same size right so even though i was</span> <span data-start="761.34" data-end="764.27">using a i have pretty big fingers</span> <span data-start="764.27" data-end="767.07">globally big fingers and but it was</span> <span data-start="767.07" data-end="769.14">still kind of a you know a small kind of</span> <span data-start="769.14" data-end="770.94">you know pointer side or a mouse-sized</span> <span data-start="770.94" data-end="772.56">death thing and that's because i'm not</span> <span data-start="772.56" data-end="774.81">using the physical geometry of that</span> <span data-start="774.81" data-end="778.74">particular pointer device and so looking</span> <span data-start="778.74" data-end="780.87">at this you know just one final tweak</span> <span data-start="780.87" data-end="782.16">i'm going i can make this is i can</span> <span data-start="782.16" data-end="784.68">actually hear i can just say you know i</span> <span data-start="784.68" data-end="786.48">just use some sort of heuristic right</span> <span data-start="786.48" data-end="788.07">add the width and the height of the</span> <span data-start="788.07" data-end="788.74">pointer to buy</span> <span data-start="788.74" data-end="790.87">and multiply enzyme 3 or use the</span> <span data-start="790.87" data-end="792.76">pressure or just you know use some kind</span> <span data-start="792.76" data-end="795.339">of default and doing that it allows us</span> <span data-start="795.339" data-end="799.33">to have a real world you know have some</span> <span data-start="799.33" data-end="800.8">real-world element to it so on the mouse</span> <span data-start="800.8" data-end="802.06">you still get the kind of the narrow</span> <span data-start="802.06" data-end="809.05">line but if I if I use my finger my</span> <span data-start="809.05" data-end="811.149">giant my giant thumb in this case you</span> <span data-start="811.149" data-end="812.86">know we get a giant line that looks you</span> <span data-start="812.86" data-end="815.41">know appropriately matches my giant</span> <span data-start="815.41" data-end="818.38">thumb so so that's just a quick example</span> <span data-start="818.38" data-end="821.95">so all of that is up on you know it when</span> <span data-start="821.95" data-end="823.54">you jump into using pointer events all</span> <span data-start="823.54" data-end="826.99">of that is up on github jump back to</span> <span data-start="826.99" data-end="830.86">presentation so I I have that those</span> <span data-start="830.86" data-end="833.11">three examples run on github if you want</span> <span data-start="833.11" data-end="836.26">to have a look at them and you know in</span> <span data-start="836.26" data-end="838.899">terms of getting started so I eat n had</span> <span data-start="838.899" data-end="840.85">vendor prefix support that I I talked</span> <span data-start="840.85" data-end="843.52">about briefly I 11 now is the UNPROFOR</span> <span data-start="843.52" data-end="845.13">it based on the draft recommendation</span> <span data-start="845.13" data-end="848.2">there's a chromium WebKit prototype at</span> <span data-start="848.2" data-end="851.589">this the shortened URL but for most of</span> <span data-start="851.589" data-end="852.64">us were probably you know for the</span> <span data-start="852.64" data-end="853.87">immediate future we're going to need to</span> <span data-start="853.87" data-end="857.07">use use polyfills so there's two</span> <span data-start="857.07" data-end="859.54">polieville is available ones written by</span> <span data-start="859.54" data-end="863.38">a microsoft ER hann j/s it's available</span> <span data-start="863.38" data-end="865.54">there and then google a googler has</span> <span data-start="865.54" data-end="867.52">actually written a polyfill as well</span> <span data-start="867.52" data-end="872.17">called point cas so you get started</span> <span data-start="872.17" data-end="874.06">today those work roughly obviously</span> <span data-start="874.06" data-end="875.529">without native support there there's</span> <span data-start="875.529" data-end="877.12">there's some approximation to exert</span> <span data-start="877.12" data-end="878.89">their interpreting Mouse events in order</span> <span data-start="878.89" data-end="881.62">to kind of build up same model but you</span> <span data-start="881.62" data-end="883.209">know to to a first approximation they</span> <span data-start="883.209" data-end="885.7">work pretty well and if it is supported</span> <span data-start="885.7" data-end="887.2">natively on the platform it uses that</span> <span data-start="887.2" data-end="890.62">and both those polyfills so that's what</span> </p>
