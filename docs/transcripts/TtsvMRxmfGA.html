data-end="95.909">decided to write this talk hopefully</span> <span data-start="95.909" data-end="97.229">there will be something useful in here</span> <span data-start="97.229" data-end="99.18">no

itself how often have you</span> <span data-start="104.399" data-end="106.32">actually spent time thinking about how</span> <span data-start="106.32" data-end="109.35">you debug it's easy to forget

data-end="118.95">improve with experience and it's not</span> <span data-start="118.95" data-end="120.54">just about the tools you use but it's</span> <span data-start="120.54" data-end="122.43">the mindset in the process and how you</span> <span data-start="122.43" data-end="124.53">actually work through your debugging</span> <span data-start="124.53" data-end="127.32">tasks and it becomes particularly clear</span> <span data-start="127.32" data-end="129.27">when we compare those new developers</span> <span data-start="129.27" data-end="132.45">with more experienced ones often

something we do</span> <span data-start="146.61" data-end="149.22">pretty much every single day and so in</span> <span data-start="149.22" data-end="151.62">this talk I won't go into the detail of</span> <span data-start="151.62" data-end="154.44">how important it is to reproduce the bug</span> <span data-start="154.44" data-end="157.019">be methodical only change one thing at a</span> <span data-start="157.019" data-end="159.63">time how to narrow down where the bug is</span> <span data-start="159.63" data-end="162.33">but it's surprising how often the stuff</span> <span data-start="162.33" data-end="164.19">is not taught so if you're a junior</span> <span data-start="164.19" data-end="165.989">developer or you're teaching junior</span> <span data-start="165.989"

<span data-start="176.31" data-end="178.23">quickly because even the most senior</span> <span data-start="178.23" data-end="179.58">developers I've worked with and</span> <span data-start="179.58" data-end="182.37">including myself sometimes I forget to</span> <span data-start="182.37" data-end="184.709">write tests like this is the first thing</span> <span data-start="184.709" data-end="186.66">that you do right if you've discovered a</span> <span data-start="186.66" data-end="189">bug write a test that reproduces it</span> <span data-start="189" data-end="191.61">because it not only will keep your focus</span> <span data-start="191.61" data-end="194.4">on just that one bug it'll also speed</span> <span data-start="194.4" data-end="196.56">you up because you no longer
