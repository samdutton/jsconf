data-end="238.919">itself to just return zero so if I pass</span> <span data-start="238.919" data-end="241.229">one plus one that's two if I pass ten</span> <span data-start="241.229" data-end="243.15">plus one that's eleven but then it just</span> <span data-start="243.15" data-end="247.379">starts returning zero so we've actually</span> <span data-start="247.379" data-end="249.439">changed the functionality here during</span> <span data-start="249.439" data-end="251.729">the runtime while our code is running</span> <span data-start="251.729" data-end="257.439">and then we have inner session</span> <span data-start="257.449" data-end="259.799">intercession is something that you can</span> <span data-start="259.799" data-end="263.669">do in

he</span> <span data-start="269.71" data-end="272.35">has a health property but we also want</span> <span data-start="272.35" data-end="275.5">to have a status field that is somehow</span> <span data-start="275.5" data-end="278.74">based on his health so we'll define a</span> <span data-start="278.74" data-end="282.55">new property status and we'll define a</span> <span data-start="282.55" data-end="285.01">getter for that saying that if his</span> <span data-start="285.01" data-end="288.01">health is larger than 50 he is fit like</span> <span data-start="288.01" data-end="291.04">a champ otherwise he's badly hurt so</span> <span data-start="291.04" data-end="293.71">here we have a property which functions</span> <span data-start="293.71" data-end="298.33">based on the runtime conditions but this</span> <span data-start="298.33" data-end="301.51">sort of of intercession in JavaScript is</span> <span data-start="301.51" data-end="306.31">pretty limited so all of this reflection</span> <span data-start="306.31" data-end="308.92">stuff happens during runtime while our</span> <span data-start="308.92" data-end="312.13">code is running and that brings us over</span> <span data-start="312.13" data-end="315.1">to it's a very natural question now is</span> <span data-start="315.1" data-end="318.31">why is all of this useful why do we need</span> <span data-start="318.31" data-end="323.46">this so I went and asked Wikipedia again</span> <span data-start="323.46" data-end="327.01">and Wikipedia's answer is in some cases</span> <span data-start="327.01" data-end="329.35">this allows programmers to minimize the</span> <span data-start="329.35" data-end="332.23">number of lines of code to express a</span> <span data-start="332.23" data-end="333.82">solution and thus reducing the</span> <span data-start="333.82" data-end="339.46">development time I think I think I'd</span> <span data-start="339.46" data-end="341.53">rather say that the reason why this is</span> <span data-start="341.53" data-end="345.04">very useful is because we want as much</span> <span data-start="345.04" data-end="347.77">expressivity as possible to model our</span> <span data-start="347.77" data-end="352.06">problems and what we want is these</span> <span data-start="352.06" data-end="354.01">elegant and developer friendly</span> <span data-start="354.01" data-end="360.1">interfaces and this brings me to an</span> <span data-start="360.1" data-end="364.06">interface that I'm pretty sure that a</span> <span data-start="364.06" data-end="366.96">lot of you are familiar with which is</span> <span data-start="366.96" data-end="373.42">proxies in the form of proxies on the</span> <span data-start="373.42" data-end="378.37">web so a proxy is usually a server</span> <span data-start="378.37" data-end="381.19">placed in front of one or more servers</span> <span data-start="381.19" data-end="384.39">and this is to abstract the way</span> <span data-start="384.39" data-end="387.4">complexity and to provide a single</span> <span data-start="387.4" data-end="391.03">interface for the consumer so this</span> <span data-start="391.03" data-end="395.12">enables you to actually intercept any</span> <span data-start="395.12" data-end="399.94">any interaction with the interface and</span> <span data-start="399.94" data-end="404.33">the use cases might be load balancing it</span> <span data-start="404.33" data-end="406.82">might be delegating based on where the</span> <span data-start="406.82" data-end="410.389">resources are and so on but the main</span> <span data-start="410.389" data-end="412.22">thing is that you're providing a single</span> <span data-start="412.22" data-end="414.32">unified interface for the consumer</span> <span data-start="414.32" data-end="417.1">hiding all these implementation details</span> <span data-start="417.1" data-end="419.96">and we can apply this concept more</span> <span data-start="419.96" data-end="422.53">generally it doesn't have to be servers</span> <span data-start="422.53" data-end="427.19">so we could instead place a proxy in</span> <span data-start="427.19" data-end="430.4">front of a set of objects we can</span> <span data-start="430.4" data-end="432.62">intercept any type of access to these</span> <span data-start="432.62" data-end="435.26">objects and provide an abstraction to</span> <span data-start="435.26" data-end="440.03">hide implementation details and this is</span> <span data-start="440.03" data-end="442.34">what is made possible with proxies that</span> <span data-start="442.34" data-end="449.02">was introduced in es6 and what this</span> <span data-start="449.02" data-end="451.97">enables is a much more powerful form of</span> <span data-start="451.97" data-end="454.85">intercession among other things in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="454.85" data-end="460.07">JavaScript and generally this means that</span> <span data-start="460.07" data-end="464.3">we are now able to intercept and define</span> <span data-start="464.3" data-end="466.94">custom behavior for fundamental</span> <span data-start="466.94" data-end="469.4">operations on objects so that means</span> <span data-start="469.4" data-end="473.289">properly lookup assignment enumeration</span> <span data-start="473.289" data-end="477.32">even function invocation and so on and</span> <span data-start="477.32" data-end="480.59">this is a very interesting feature for</span> <span data-start="480.59" data-end="482.9">another reason as well because this is</span> <span data-start="482.9" data-end="487.34">one of the few features that essentially</span> <span data-start="487.34" data-end="490.61">requires engine support unlike most of</span> <span data-start="490.61" data-end="493.76">use six which is syntax sugar that can</span> <span data-start="493.76" data-end="496.639">be transpiled using Babel for example</span> <span data-start="496.639" data-end="501.31">this isn't actually viable with proxies</span> <span data-start="501.31" data-end="505.28">but thankfully the support has become</span> <span data-start="505.28" data-end="509.83">pretty good except ie</span> <span data-start="509.83" data-end="518.779">which hopefully yeah doesn't stop you</span> <span data-start="518.789" data-end="523.149">so the proxy in JavaScript has its own</span> <span data-start="523.149" data-end="526.42">constructor and the constructor takes a</span> <span data-start="526.42" data-end="530.339">target object and a handler object and</span> <span data-start="530.339" data-end="533.68">this target object can be any type of</span> <span data-start="533.68" data-end="535.66">object it can be a plane object it can</span> <span data-start="535.66" data-end="538.6">be an array it can be a function because</span> <span data-start="538.6" data-end="540.639">functions are objects in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="540.639" data-end="544.18">it can even be another proxy so you can</span> <span data-start="544.18" data-end="547.99">proxy a proxy another important thing</span> <span data-start="547.99" data-end="550.18">about proxies is that they're completely</span> <span data-start="550.18" data-end="552.97">transparent so if I say that I'm</span> <span data-start="552.97" data-end="554.529">creating a proxy here with a plain</span> <span data-start="554.529" data-end="558.939">object as the target if I check type of</span> <span data-start="558.939" data-end="561.67">of this proxy it'll give me object so</span> <span data-start="561.67" data-end="564.629">there's no such thing as a proxy type</span> <span data-start="564.629" data-end="569.5">it's entirely transparent and then</span> <span data-start="569.5" data-end="572.68">there's the handler object and this is</span> <span data-start="572.68" data-end="575.62">where we define so-called traps for all</span> <span data-start="575.62" data-end="577.329">of these operations that you can do on</span> <span data-start="577.329" data-end="580.75">objects and here's an example with a</span> <span data-start="580.75" data-end="583.839">getter trap where we say that if you</span> <span data-start="583.839" data-end="586.75">ever try to get a property from this</span> <span data-start="586.75" data-end="592.899">object we'll just return 37 so we can</span> <span data-start="592.899" data-end="594.79">create a new proxy using that Handler</span> <span data-start="594.79" data-end="598.389">and if I try to access a from this</span> <span data-start="598.389" data-end="600.339">object or B from this object it'll just</span> <span data-start="600.339" data-end="604.18">keep returning 37 and for any available</span> <span data-start="604.18" data-end="606.73">fundamental operation there is a</span> <span data-start="606.73" data-end="609.189">corresponding trap so you have a getter</span> <span data-start="609.189" data-end="613.209">trap you have a setter has apply and so</span> <span data-start="613.209" data-end="616.93">on and you also have this accompanying</span> <span data-start="616.93" data-end="621.91">new api called the reflect api which can</span> <span data-start="621.91" data-end="624.04">be used to perform all of these</span> <span data-start="624.04" data-end="628.839">operations on objects and an example of</span> <span data-start="628.839" data-end="630.85">this is let's say we have an object here</span> <span data-start="630.85" data-end="634.66">with a property we can use reflect get</span> <span data-start="634.66" data-end="636.279">to say that we want to get the health</span> <span data-start="636.279" data-end="641.439">property from this hero object so in the</span> <span data-start="641.439" data-end="644.23">same way that there is a trap for every</span> <span data-start="644.23" data-end="647.37">operation there is</span> <span data-start="647.37" data-end="651.029">a corresponding method in the reflect</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="651.029" data-end="654.779">API so if we do a complete one-to-one</span> <span data-start="654.779" data-end="658.589">mapping here you'll get a proxy that is</span> <span data-start="658.589" data-end="661.08">just a pure relay it doesn't do anything</span> <span data-start="661.08" data-end="664.05">it'll behave the object will behave just</span> <span data-start="664.05" data-end="666.87">as it would have if you didn't wrap it</span> <span data-start="666.87" data-end="670.29">in a proxy so the nice thing now is that</span> <span data-start="670.29" data-end="672.6">as I said you can have overload a lot of</span> <span data-start="672.6" data-end="674.4">these fundamental operations like the</span> <span data-start="674.4" data-end="676.529">dot operator the equals and the function</span> <span data-start="676.529" data-end="681.9">call and one example of this is let's</span> <span data-start="681.9" data-end="683.94">say we wanted to add some</span> <span data-start="683.94" data-end="686.7">instrumentation to our code so we'll</span> <span data-start="686.7" data-end="688.14">create a function that's called log</span> <span data-start="688.14" data-end="690.18">access to properties it takes an object</span> <span data-start="690.18" data-end="694.56">and we return a proxy with that object</span> <span data-start="694.56" data-end="698.13">as the target object and then we pass it</span> <span data-start="698.13" data-end="700.95">a handler object with a getter trap</span> <span data-start="700.95" data-end="703.29">saying that ok if you ever try to get</span> <span data-start="703.29" data-end="704.97">something from this object I'll log out</span> <span data-start="704.97" data-end="707.31">whatever you try to get and then I'll</span> <span data-start="707.31" data-end="710.15">return a result of actually getting that</span> <span data-start="710.15" data-end="712.74">and we can also add a setter trap saying</span> <span data-start="712.74" data-end="714.57">that if you try to set something will</span> <span data-start="714.57" data-end="718.44">log out whatever you try to set and then</span> <span data-start="718.44" data-end="722.01">we'll set that on the object and the</span> <span data-start="722.01" data-end="724.32">nice thing here is that the object that</span> <span data-start="724.32" data-end="726.209">is being wrapped in a proxy doesn't know</span> <span data-start="726.209"

data-end="735.839">wrapping so it's completely decoupled so</span> <span data-start="735.839" data-end="738">if you use this now we can create an</span> <span data-start="738" data-end="742.98">object a bit like here we can create an</span> <span data-start="742.98" data-end="746.04">object with some properties and then we</span> <span data-start="746.04" data-end="749.25">can create a proxy using this function</span> <span data-start="749.25" data-end="752.97">log access to properties so whenever I</span> <span data-start="752.97" data-end="755.67">try to access a property here now it'll</span> <span data-start="755.67" data-end="757.62">log out the access and if I try to</span> <span data-start="757.62" data-end="760.08">change something it'll log out whatever</span> <span data-start="760.08" data-end="766.23">you changed and we can also use proxies</span> <span data-start="766.23" data-end="770.9">to make observable objects pretty easily</span> <span data-start="770.9" data-end="773.52">so let's say we create us as a function</span> <span data-start="773.52" data-end="775.8">called observable which takes an object</span> <span data-start="775.8" data-end="778.8">that you want to observe and then it</span> <span data-start="778.8" data-end="780.66">takes an unchanged function</span> <span data-start="780.66" data-end="783.65">we'll call whenever something changes</span> <span data-start="783.65" data-end="787.26">we'll return a new proxy put the object</span> <span data-start="787.26" data-end="789.36">in the target putting a handler which</span> <span data-start="789.36" data-end="791.82">has a set trap so whenever you try to</span> <span data-start="791.82" data-end="794.19">set something on this object will</span> <span data-start="794.19" data-end="796.23">actually set it and then afterwards</span> <span data-start="796.23" data-end="798">we'll call the unchanged method with</span> <span data-start="798" data-end="802.47">whatever you updated so if you want to</span> <span data-start="802.47" data-end="806.01">use this this isn't actually as useful</span> <span data-start="806.01" data-end="809">as true observables because we have to</span> <span data-start="809" data-end="813.03">overwrite the original object but now we</span> <span data-start="813.03" data-end="815.28">can create an object here that is</span> <span data-start="815.28" data-end="818.4">observable so if I ever change if I</span> <span data-start="818.4" data-end="820.26">change the name here it'll log out name</span> <span data-start="820.26" data-end="821.88">change to Frank if I change the age</span> <span data-start="821.88" data-end="827.07">it'll log out the age change to 40 so</span> <span data-start="827.07" data-end="830.04">all of this is nice but it's not really</span> <span data-start="830.04" data-end="833.97">something that would revolutionize how</span> <span data-start="833.97" data-end="837.69">you write code in JavaScript so I tried</span> <span data-start="837.69" data-end="839.52">to I try to think about I didn't really</span> <span data-start="839.52" data-end="840.75">want to do this talk before I had</span> <span data-start="840.75" data-end="844.98">something useful to do do you use</span> <span data-start="844.98" data-end="849.18">proxies for so for the last year I've</span> <span data-start="849.18" data-end="850.86">been working on a client project with a</span> <span data-start="850.86" data-end="853.8">lot of people where we have a

data-start="859.83" data-end="861.48">have a lot of data that looks like this</span> <span data-start="861.48" data-end="865.25">let's say we have we have a collection</span> <span data-start="865.25" data-end="869.85">we have a collection of stories and</span> <span data-start="869.85" data-end="872.73">every story has an ID it has a title it</span> <span data-start="872.73" data-end="875.16">has an author it has a list of people</span> <span data-start="875.16" data-end="877.53">that have liked this story that have</span> <span data-start="877.53" data-end="879.9">read this story and so on and what you</span> <span data-start="879.9" data-end="882.72">can see here is that it's just</span> <span data-start="882.72" data-end="889.59">references and we can also imagine that</span> <span data-start="889.59" data-end="892.4">we have another list here of people and</span> <span data-start="892.4" data-end="896.28">these people have authored books they</span> <span data-start="896.28" data-end="901.88">have read books they have liked books so</span> <span data-start="901.88" data-end="904.14">what we see here is that these</span> <span data-start="904.14" data-end="905.7">references are actually pointing to</span> <span data-start="905.7" data-end="908.94">different objects so the person one here</span> <span data-start="908.94" data-end="911.89">is pointing to person one in our</span> <span data-start="911.89" data-end="914.8">in our people collection and story one</span> <span data-start="914.8" data-end="919.12">here is are all pointing to the first</span> <span data-start="919.12" data-end="923.52">story so what we really have here is</span> <span data-start="923.52" data-end="927.49">it's sort of a graph so if we just</span> <span data-start="927.49" data-end="929.89">consolidate this into an object we have</span> <span data-start="929.89" data-end="931.75">a collection of stories and we have a</span> <span data-start="931.75"

data-end="941.41">what does it look like if you want to</span> <span data-start="941.41" data-end="943.45">traverse this thing let's say you want</span> <span data-start="943.45" data-end="945.85">you need to traverse this thing very</span> <span data-start="945.85" data-end="949.45">deeply so we can start out then let's</span> <span data-start="949.45" data-end="952">say we want to find we want to find the</span> <span data-start="952" data-end="955.78">name of the first person that liked the</span> <span data-start="955.78" data-end="958.81">first story so we'll go into the graph</span> <span data-start="958.81" data-end="961.63">we'll pull out the first story we'll</span> <span data-start="961.63" data-end="964.3">pull out the array of references but to</span> <span data-start="964.3" data-end="966.61">people who have liked it we'll have to</span> <span data-start="966.61" data-end="969.73">map it so that we can actually map it</span> <span data-start="969.73" data-end="974.74">over to the actual objects and then</span> <span data-start="974.74" data-end="977.56">you'll have to choose the first element</span> <span data-start="977.56" data-end="979.3">of that and then we can pull out the</span> <span data-start="979.3" data-end="983.47">name or if you want to find the title of</span> <span data-start="983.47" data-end="986.08">the first like story by the author this</span> <span data-start="986.08" data-end="989.05">is getting pretty deep now we'll have to</span> <span data-start="989.05" data-end="991.39">get the right collection based on this</span> <span data-start="991.39" data-end="994.83">reference we'll have to find the correct</span> <span data-start="994.83" data-end="998.32">author and then we can pull out the</span> <span data-start="998.32" data-end="1003.03">title from there this gets really</span> <span data-start="1003.03" data-end="1008.27">tedious it would be so much better if we</span> <span data-start="1008.27" data-end="1011.4">could just access this like it was a</span> <span data-start="1011.4" data-end="1014.55">plain object so that we can go into the</span> <span data-start="1014.55" data-end="1018.39">first story we can go into the like by</span> <span data-start="1018.39" data-end="1021.99">list and then just assume that that's</span> <span data-start="1021.99" data-end="1024.53">the actual object not just a reference</span> <span data-start="1024.53" data-end="1028.58">and the same thing with the title here</span> <span data-start="1028.58" data-end="1031.92">so this is really this would be a much</span> <span data-start="1031.92" data-end="1033.72">better interface to interact with this</span> <span data-start="1033.72" data-end="1037.74">graph so what we really want our data to</span> <span data-start="1037.74" data-end="1041.4">look like is something like this because</span> <span data-start="1041.4" data-end="1044.67">what we have is just a reference here we</span> <span data-start="1044.67" data-end="1046.049">are</span> <span data-start="1046.049" data-end="1049.789">we're in story one and it has an author</span> <span data-start="1049.789" data-end="1052.259">but what we really want is that author</span> <span data-start="1052.259" data-end="1055.44">to be that object and again that has a</span> <span data-start="1055.44" data-end="1057.779">list of stories that the author has</span> <span data-start="1057.779" data-end="1061.83">liked and we would just rather have that</span> <span data-start="1061.83" data-end="1066.389">be the actual story and so on</span> <span data-start="1066.389" data-end="1069.09">and this goes on infinitely right</span> <span data-start="1069.09" data-end="1073.559">because this is circular so we need some</span> <span data-start="1073.559" data-end="1077.099">kind of way of transforming this object</span> <span data-start="1077.099" data-end="1079.379">that contains only references to an</span> <span data-start="1079.379" data-end="1083.849">actually populated object here so let's</span> <span data-start="1083.849" data-end="1085.589">imagine that we could create an</span> <span data-start="1085.589" data-end="1089.149">interface a function called populate</span> <span data-start="1089.149" data-end="1093.839">which would take the graph as an</span> <span data-start="1093.839" data-end="1096.33">argument and then the node you wanted to</span> <span data-start="1096.33" data-end="1099.539">populate so as an example we we would</span> <span data-start="1099.539" data-end="1102.869">want to have a populated version of the</span> <span data-start="1102.869" data-end="1107.94">first story in our list but how could we</span> <span data-start="1107.94" data-end="1110.219">ever implement this so the naive</span> <span data-start="1110.219" data-end="1114.659">approach would be that okay I'll just</span> <span data-start="1114.659" data-end="1116.429">use something like object a sign and</span> <span data-start="1116.429" data-end="1119.009">just I don't know just keep filling this</span> <span data-start="1119.009" data-end="1121.889">in recursively and until something just</span> <span data-start="1121.889" data-end="1123.629">blows up right because it's infinite</span> <span data-start="1123.629" data-end="1126.419">it's not possible it's just not possible</span> <span data-start="1126.419" data-end="1130.589">to to do this in something that needs to</span> <span data-start="1130.589" data-end="1135.839">evaluate upfront but this is a really</span> <span data-start="1135.839" data-end="1140.379">nice use case for proxies</span> <span data-start="1140.389" data-end="1143.639">so with proxies you can actually make</span> <span data-start="1143.639" data-end="1147.869">this work because even if it seems like</span> <span data-start="1147.869" data-end="1151.169">we have to do this upfront really really</span> <span data-start="1151.169" data-end="1155.94">don't have to because with proxies just</span> <span data-start="1155.94" data-end="1160.589">like with proxy web servers we could</span> <span data-start="1160.589" data-end="1163.409">just say that okay I'm in

just one bump in the road</span> <span data-start="1435.929" data-end="1442.11">and that is I figured so this is nice</span> <span data-start="1442.11" data-end="1443.909">but I still have to use this seatbelt</span> <span data-start="1443.909" data-end="1445.529">thing I don't want to do that I want</span> <span data-start="1445.529" data-end="1448.139">this to be automatic so I tried to do</span> <span data-start="1448.139" data-end="1453.6">this I wanted to set the prototype as a</span> <span data-start="1453.6" data-end="1460.289">seatbelt object and it turns out that it</span> <span data-start="1460.289" data-end="1464.159">turns out that someone smart had figured</span> <span data-start="1464.159" data-end="1466.289">out that this is not good</span> <span data-start="1466.289" data-end="1471.48">and now this prototype object the bottom</span> <span data-start="1471.48" data-end="1473.85">level prototype is a so-called exotic</span> <span data-start="1473.85" data-end="1475.95">object so you cannot override the</span> <span data-start="1475.95" data-end="1478.889">prototype I even tried to look for any</span> <span data-start="1478.889" data-end="1481.59">version that implemented proxies but not</span> <span data-start="1481.59" data-end="1485.669">this exotic object and I even considered</span> <span data-start="1485.669" data-end="1488.58">compiling my own v8 for node and then</span> <span data-start="1488.58" data-end="1491.039">making this work but I figured I'm just</span> <span data-start="1491.039" data-end="1492.5">too far down the rabbit hole this is</span> <span data-start="1492.5" data-end="1496.379">ridiculous so I figured I'm taking it</span> <span data-start="1496.379" data-end="1502.639">too far but it would have been fun so</span> <span data-start="1502.639" data-end="1508.44">with this I was really sad about that</span> <span data-start="1508.44" data-end="1514.399">but in conclusion you can use proxies</span> <span data-start="1514.399" data-end="1516.99">for a lot of good things you can make</span> <span data-start="1516.99" data-end="1520.59">really powerful abstractions and you can</span> <span data-start="1520.59" data-end="1523.639">add a lot of functionality transparently</span> <span data-start="1523.639" data-end="1526.35">but the bad thing is that you can also</span> <span data-start="1526.35" data-end="1528.919">just mangle things completely and</span> <span data-start="1528.919" data-end="1531.799">introduce a lot of magic so that</span> </p>
