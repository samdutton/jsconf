data-start="594.12" data-end="596.85">a property even if this was practical it</span> <span data-start="596.85" data-end="598.38">only really affects code that we've</span> <span data-start="598.38" data-end="601.11">compiled so all third-party code that</span> <span data-start="601.11" data-end="603.649">would execute it it would work normally</span> <span data-start="603.649" data-end="607.43">so it's kind of iffy we can't completely</span> <span data-start="607.43" data-end="609.959">replicate at least not practically some</span> <span data-start="609.959" data-end="612.39">of these features and semantics so we</span> <span data-start="612.39" data-end="616.47">can't not allow people to do it at least</span> <span data-start="616.47" data-end="619.699">not practically what about no prototype</span> <span data-start="619.699" data-end="622.44">so as I said before our functions aren't</span> <span data-start="622.44" data-end="626.31">normal functions they so they have no</span> <span data-start="626.31" data-end="628.11">prototype so you can't use them</span> <span data-start="628.11" data-end="630.66">constructors so since we just turn them</span> <span data-start="630.66" data-end="632.399">into normal functions how could we get</span> <span data-start="632.399" data-end="635.279">the same behavior so we need some way to</span> <span data-start="635.279" data-end="637.529">mark it as an arrow function in this</span> <span data-start="637.529" data-end="639.66">case we add a property and then we</span> <span data-start="639.66" data-end="641.73">change all references to just dot</span> <span data-start="641.73" data-end="644.43">prototype to use this helper method that</span> <span data-start="644.43" data-end="646.079">checks see if its function if it is</span> <span data-start="646.079" data-end="648.42">returned  otherwise just return</span> <span data-start="648.42" data-end="652.05">the prototype um this is problematic</span> <span data-start="652.05" data-end="654.089">since Java scripts of dynamic language</span> <span data-start="654.089" data-end="657.39">so it could be like this it's kind of</span> <span data-start="657.39" data-end="660.209">difficult to catch so this means that</span> <span data-start="660.209" data-end="662.22">you have to wrap every single property</span> <span data-start="662.22" data-end="664.5">access computed property access to</span> <span data-start="664.5" data-end="666.45">determine whether or not it's ever going</span> <span data-start="666.45" data-end="669.899">to access prototype so you end up with</span> <span data-start="669.899" data-end="671.43">something like this</span> <span data-start="671.43" data-end="672.779">it's going to add a lot of additional</span> <span data-start="672.779" data-end="675.36">overhead especially in hot code where</span> <span data-start="675.36" data-end="677.85">performance is extremely critical it's</span> <span data-start="677.85" data-end="680.85">not really ideal you're really</span> <span data-start="680.85" data-end="683.31">implementing a lot of native JavaScript</span> <span data-start="683.31" data-end="687">features that are kind of unnecessary so</span> <span data-start="687" data-end="689.88">this is even worse the main wrapping or</span> <span data-start="689.88" data-end="691.29">code that we think is dynamic with</span> <span data-start="691.29" data-end="693.3">helpers so at this point were like a</span> <span data-start="693.3" data-end="695.55">little engine that could you can almost</span> <span data-start="695.55" data-end="697.47">get there you're so close but there are</span> <span data-start="697.47" data-end="698.64">some things that you can't really</span> <span data-start="698.64" data-end="701.31">practically implement using just a s5</span> <span data-start="701.31" data-end="702.839">especially if you want really good</span> <span data-start="702.839" data-end="705.93">performance so what is this mean for the</span> <span data-start="705.93" data-end="707.519">average developer that's currently</span> <span data-start="707.519" data-end="709.709">transpiring what would the migration</span> <span

data-end="717.87">you know like if you're relying on some</span> <span data-start="717.87" data-end="721.32">of these unspecified semantics split</span> <span data-start="721.32" data-end="722.64">that the transpiler</span> <span data-start="722.64" data-end="725.519">will kind of destroy then you may you're</span> <span data-start="725.519" data-end="727.38">likely to run into issues but it's</span> <span data-start="727.38" data-end="728.519">better than nothing</span> <span data-start="728.519" data-end="732.39">and so following this kind of want to</span> <span data-start="732.39" data-end="734.85">emphasize this point where you shouldn't</span> <span data-start="734.85" data-end="736.17">be using transpilers to learn new</span> <span data-start="736.17" data-end="739.41">language features you can definitely</span> <span data-start="739.41" data-end="741.209">like compare the output but if you're</span> <span data-start="741.209" data-end="744.72">just basing all of your knowledge on new</span> <span data-start="744.72" data-end="746.07">language features on hey this is</span> <span data-start="746.07" data-end="747.839">equivalent in es5 so it's exactly the</span> <span data-start="747.839" data-end="749.339">same then you're likely going to be</span> <span data-start="749.339" data-end="750.66">misinformed since there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="750.66" data-end="752.67">hidden semantics that can't properly be</span> <span data-start="752.67" data-end="756.81">replicated and even like stuff like</span> <span data-start="756.81" data-end="758.19">referencing a variable can drastically</span> <span data-start="758.19" data-end="760.44">change the way that the</span> <span data-start="760.44" data-end="764.07">it is generated and so yeah it's it's</span> <span data-start="764.07" data-end="766.77">really contextual so you shouldn't</span> <span data-start="766.77" data-end="770.28">really be relying on transpilers to</span> <span data-start="770.28" data-end="771.69">learn your language features so what</span> <span data-start="771.69" data-end="774.89">about something a little more practical</span> <span data-start="774.89" data-end="777.69">application optimization at face value</span> <span data-start="777.69" data-end="780.63">this may seem like an eclaim but allow</span> <span data-start="780.63" data-end="781.44">me to elaborate</span> <span data-start="781.44" data-end="783.36">so the preface is so I have to talk</span> <span data-start="783.36" data-end="786.75">about compile time versus run time so</span> <span data-start="786.75" data-end="789.27">when you're compiling your code it so at</span> <span data-start="789.27" data-end="791.28">compile time it's only compiling your</span> <span data-start="791.28" data-end="792.93">code that hasn't even been executed yet</span> <span data-start="792.93" data-end="795.54">and run time is when your code is</span> <span data-start="795.54" data-end="796.95">actually running so when it's executing</span> <span data-start="796.95" data-end="798.66">and you simply know different things at</span> <span data-start="798.66" data-end="800.49">different times so when you're compiling</span> <span data-start="800.49" data-end="802.59">the code you can determine that Square</span> <span data-start="802.59" data-end="804.78">is called with a two literal and then</span> <span data-start="804.78" data-end="806.61">and then Square is called the M with</span> <span data-start="806.61" data-end="809.97">just a variable at runtime you can't</span> <span data-start="809.97" data-end="812.07">determine the square function can't</span> <span data-start="812.07" data-end="813.51">determine what it's being called with</span> <span data-start="813.51" data-end="814.74">since it only cares about the actual</span> <span data-start="814.74" data-end="816.63">value not kind of where it came from or</span> <span data-start="816.63" data-end="819.33">how it was represented so this is</span> <span data-start="819.33" data-end="820.83">extremely useful so we can determine</span> <span data-start="820.83" data-end="824.51">what the exact intent of the code was</span> <span data-start="824.51" data-end="827.61">this is so what are some examples of</span> <span data-start="827.61" data-end="830.79">this so a big one is reiax</span> <span data-start="830.79" data-end="833.01">you may have heard of it it has a neat</span> <span data-start="833.01" data-end="838.41">feature or well feature JSX which is xml</span> <span data-start="838.41" data-end="840.27">like syntax you either love it or hate</span> <span data-start="840.27" data-end="840.54">it</span> <span data-start="840.54" data-end="842.91">it is however good for one thing which</span> <span data-start="842.91" data-end="845.16">is writing additional language semantics</span> <span data-start="845.16" data-end="846.72">now traditionally it's really just being</span> <span data-start="846.72" data-end="848.28">syntax handy so it's been like a</span> <span data-start="848.28" data-end="850.35">one-to-one mapping to your function</span> <span data-start="850.35" data-end="854.07">calls but in Reax 0.14 JSX elements are</span> <span data-start="854.07" data-end="856.56">treated as constant value types so if it</span> <span data-start="856.56" data-end="858.03">looks the same then we'll always return</span> <span data-start="858.03" data-end="859.56">the same value so whenever you call</span> <span data-start="859.56" data-end="861.86">render it will return the exact same</span> <span data-start="861.86" data-end="865.32">instance so this is extremely important</span> <span data-start="865.32" data-end="867.27">for performance since why you're</span> <span data-start="867.27" data-end="868.86">constantly doing more work than you have</span> <span data-start="868.86" data-end="871.77">to so this would be turn in something</span> <span data-start="871.77" data-end="873.21">like this so it'd be hosted to the</span> <span data-start="873.21" data-end="875.58">highest paper that could and then just</span> <span data-start="875.58" data-end="877.65">return free would be done in the render</span> <span data-start="877.65" data-end="880.2">method so each time you called through a</span> <span data-start="880.2" data-end="883.04">render story it would return the same</span> <span data-start="883.04" data-end="886.53">element so this works for immutable</span> <span data-start="886.53" data-end="888.78">elements but this enough to be applied</span> <span data-start="888.78" data-end="891.33">to readable ones as well so here the</span> <span data-start="891.33" data-end="893.889">react the JSX element you</span> <span data-start="893.889" data-end="895.48">as references the fruit and text</span> <span data-start="895.48" data-end="898.239">variables and so that can be wasted to</span> <span data-start="898.239" data-end="902.549">the create component function like so um</span> <span data-start="902.549" data-end="905.04">and so the core concept is just</span> <span data-start="905.04" data-end="907.72">pre-processing and making the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="907.72" data-end="910.269">engine do less since doing less is</span> <span data-start="910.269" data-end="912.669">generally faster and JavaScript engines</span> <span data-start="912.669" data-end="914.949">have no way to infer this kind of</span> <span data-start="914.949"
