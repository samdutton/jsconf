<p><span data-start="58.84" data-end="61.75">UNIX socket and the TCP socket and vials</span> <span data-start="61.75" data-end="63.16">and just kind of all of this different</span> <span data-start="63.16" data-end="68.189">IO all at the same time and it does this</span> <span data-start="68.189" data-end="72.67">in a way that's not at all new it's what</span> <span data-start="72.67" data-end="76.42">twisted and what event machine do which</span> <span data-start="76.42" data-end="80.35">is making the network i/o non-blocking</span> <span data-start="80.35" data-end="84.939">and using an event loop yeah and the</span> <span data-start="84.939" data-end="88.99">file i/o is is asynchronous which is a</span> <span data-start="88.99" data-end="90.759">little bit new so it has a built in</span> <span data-start="90.759" data-end="93.189">thread pool so that whenever you call</span> <span data-start="93.189" data-end="97.119">like some blocking system call on on</span> <span data-start="97.119" data-end="99.67">some file which system calls usually are</span> <span data-start="99.67" data-end="102.49">on actual hard drive files it actually</span> <span data-start="102.49" data-end="105.069">goes to a thread pool so you you kind of</span> <span data-start="105.069" data-end="106.6">get this complete non blocking</span> <span data-start="106.6" data-end="112.869">environment and so just a very simple</span> <span data-start="112.869" data-end="117.399">demonstration this is a little program</span> <span data-start="117.399" data-end="120.099">that listens starts a web server and</span> <span data-start="120.099" data-end="122.59">starts a TCP server at the same time and</span> <span data-start="122.59" data-end="125.439">the web server is listening on port 8000</span> <span data-start="125.439" data-end="127.929">and the the TCP server is listening on</span> <span data-start="127.929" data-end="133">port 8000 and 1 and when you connect to</span> <span data-start="133" data-end="134.739">the web server you get hello world and</span> <span data-start="134.739" data-end="137.2">when you connect to the TCP server it</span> <span data-start="137.2" data-end="138.849">tells you how many people have connected</span> <span data-start="138.849" data-end="140.23">to the web server</span> <span data-start="140.23" data-end="144.41">just just an example that you can throw</span> <span data-start="144.41" data-end="148.28">multiple lots of different types of io</span> <span data-start="148.28" data-end="154.86">into the same program rather easily</span> <span data-start="154.87" data-end="158.66">right so here's a here's a reference to</span> <span data-start="158.66" data-end="162.23">a the other video so I want to talk</span> <span data-start="162.23" data-end="165.5">about speed actually in node because</span> <span data-start="165.5" data-end="168.07">it's it's pretty important like</span> <span data-start="168.07" data-end="170.39">everything is speed actually if the</span> <span data-start="170.39" data-end="172.1">program is not fast then it's it's</span> <span data-start="172.1" data-end="177.71">basically worthless and I think it's</span> <span data-start="177.71" data-end="182.45">important to make an environment like</span> <span data-start="182.45" data-end="185.48">this that is supposed to be for writing</span> <span data-start="185.48" data-end="187.61">servers and stuff as fast as it possibly</span> <span data-start="187.61" data-end="194.33">can be so what I want to do is is try to</span> <span data-start="194.33" data-end="197.83">describe to you how node is fast and</span> <span data-start="197.83" data-end="200.57">maybe some things that are not fast</span> <span data-start="200.57" data-end="203.15">about it just kind of put a realistic</span> <span data-start="203.15" data-end="205.64">perspective on you know what is this</span> <span data-start="205.64" data-end="208.76">there's no thing and really how fast is</span> <span data-start="208.76" data-end="213.11">it and so to do that I'll give some a</span> <span data-start="213.11" data-end="216.41">couple of benchmarks and I'll benchmark</span> <span data-start="216.41" data-end="221.81">against engine X which is a web server</span> <span data-start="221.81" data-end="226.94">written in C and is really really quite</span> <span data-start="226.94" data-end="233.57">fast and maybe there's the possibility</span> <span data-start="233.57" data-end="237.05">of a faster web server but I think we</span> <span data-start="237.05" data-end="239.18">can take engine X as kind of like the</span> <span data-start="239.18" data-end="242.36">baseline this is what is possible and</span> <span data-start="242.36" data-end="244.34">you probably can't get much better than</span> <span data-start="244.34" data-end="247.64">that and then we'll we'll benchmark node</span> <span data-start="247.64" data-end="252.56">and then we'll benchmark to web servers</span> <span data-start="252.56" data-end="256.48">for dynamic languages which is tornado</span> <span data-start="256.48" data-end="262.73">and then tornados Python thing and thin</span> <span data-start="262.73" data-end="266.66">is a ruby thing and I just did it on</span> <span data-start="266.66" data-end="269.84">this on this laptop these these</span> <span data-start="269.84" data-end="272.02">benchmarks aren't really meant to be</span> <span data-start="272.02" data-end="273.93">real necessary</span> <span data-start="273.93" data-end="275.58">it's not just trying to simulate like</span> <span data-start="275.58" data-end="279.83">actual what would happen on a website</span> <span data-start="279.83" data-end="281.88">because basically we're going to hit it</span> <span data-start="281.88" data-end="286.41">with more load than is achievable on a</span> <span data-start="286.41" data-end="291.24">single like Network device all four of</span> <span data-start="291.24" data-end="293.46">these web servers can saturate your</span> <span data-start="293.46" data-end="295.8">bandwidth right there they're all quite</span> <span data-start="295.8" data-end="299.009">fast what we're interested in is is more</span> <span data-start="299.009" data-end="302.31">about how they perform under very high</span> <span data-start="302.31" data-end="305.37">load levels and just see if we can bring</span> <span data-start="305.37" data-end="312.15">out any problems with with them so let's</span> <span data-start="312.15" data-end="313.83">let's just start with the standard like</span> <span data-start="313.83" data-end="318.3">hello world web server and what we'll do</span> <span data-start="318.3" data-end="320.34">is is we'll just hit it we'll hit each</span> <span data-start="320.34" data-end="323.46">of these with Apache bench and look at</span> <span data-start="323.46" data-end="325.8">how they differ with different amounts</span> <span data-start="325.8" data-end="329.58">of concurrency so hopefully you can see</span> <span data-start="329.58" data-end="331.889">this I'm not sure if it okay looks</span> <span data-start="331.889" data-end="336.199">visible um so so here's here's the the</span> <span data-start="336.199" data-end="339.479">the three control servers right nginx is</span> <span data-start="339.479" data-end="341.25">on the bottom okay wait so so</span> <span data-start="341.25" data-end="343.8">concurrency is is the horizontal axis</span> <span data-start="343.8" data-end="346.139">that's how many people are connecting at</span> <span data-start="346.139" data-end="348.75">the same time and the vertical axis is</span> <span data-start="348.75" data-end="352.229">response time so you want to be fast you</span> <span data-start="352.229" data-end="353.88">want to be lower down on the graph so</span> <span data-start="353.88" data-end="356.97">smaller is better so so engine X looks</span> <span data-start="356.97" data-end="358.849">really good it's at the bottom as</span> <span data-start="358.849" data-end="361.71">expected since somewhere in the middle</span> <span data-start="361.71" data-end="365.88">and and tornadoes a bit slower again the</span> <span data-start="365.88" data-end="368.82">actual numbers here aren't really so</span> <span data-start="368.82" data-end="372.05">important because they're probably not</span> <span data-start="372.05" data-end="374.729">you probably can't achieve this sort of</span> <span data-start="374.729" data-end="379.05">load actually in real life but the point</span> <span data-start="379.05" data-end="382.68">is engine X is quite a bit faster than</span> <span data-start="382.68" data-end="384.96">than the other ones by a factor of two</span> <span data-start="384.96" data-end="385.46">or three</span> <span data-start="385.46" data-end="388.83">so if we add note into there then it</span> <span data-start="388.83" data-end="392.699">looks like this which is good I would</span> <span data-start="392.699" data-end="396.389">say it's not really comparable to engine</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="396.389" data-end="399.75">X but it's it's looking good when</span> <span data-start="399.75" data-end="406.26">compared to thin yep</span> <span data-start="406.27" data-end="409.97">so now let's let's let's do another</span> <span data-start="409.97" data-end="413">benchmark and instead of just sending a</span> <span data-start="413" data-end="415.61">hello world response what we can do is</span> <span data-start="415.61" data-end="419.63">is fix our concurrency and and vary the</span> <span data-start="419.63" data-end="424.79">response size so you know send a five</span> <span data-start="424.79" data-end="426.95">kilobyte response send a ten kilobyte</span> <span data-start="426.95" data-end="429.25">response and see how the web servers</span> <span data-start="429.25" data-end="432.38">deal with with these different amounts</span> <span data-start="432.38" data-end="440.51">of throughput basically and so so well</span> <span data-start="440.51" data-end="442.37">ignore that bottom line here's oh wait</span> <span data-start="442.37" data-end="445.46">okay yeah so so basically this is this</span> <span data-start="445.46" data-end="448.25">is what the node webserver would do this</span> <span data-start="448.25" data-end="450.5">is for 16 kilobytes so you you just</span> <span data-start="450.5" data-end="453.77">generate some some string of data and</span> <span data-start="453.77" data-end="456.23">then you you when somebody connects you</span> <span data-start="456.23" data-end="457.76">write that string to the socket so this</span> <span data-start="457.76" data-end="459.77">would be 4 for 16 kilobytes but we're</span> <span data-start="459.77" data-end="462.14">going to vary the amount of response</span> <span data-start="462.14" data-end="466.64">size okay so so again here's the control</span> <span data-start="466.64" data-end="472.58">servers and again response time is on</span> <span data-start="472.58" data-end="475.76">the vertical axis and nginx looks really</span> <span data-start="475.76" data-end="478.13">good and it's it's approximately the</span> <span data-start="478.13" data-end="481.4">same as what we saw before you know thin</span> <span data-start="481.4" data-end="483.53">is in the middle tornadoes a little bit</span> <span data-start="483.53" data-end="488.17">slower and engine X is at the bottom so</span> <span data-start="488.17" data-end="491.8">let's let's add node into this picture</span> <span data-start="491.8" data-end="494.99">remember here this is 2 to the 18 so</span> <span data-start="494.99" data-end="498.23">that's like 256 kilobytes or something</span> <span data-start="498.23" data-end="501.56">like that and this is you know your</span> <span data-start="501.56" data-end="504.95">basic hello world program so you know</span> <span data-start="504.95" data-end="509.21">they slow down as you as you as they</span> <span data-start="509.21" data-end="512.419">send larger responses so let's let's add</span> <span data-start="512.419" data-end="518.63">note into this picture and I'll let you</span> <span data-start="518.63" data-end="523.97">grasp this for a second this is not good</span> <span data-start="523.97" data-end="526.1">that's a bad spike that's not a good</span> <span data-start="526.1" data-end="531.98">spike down here they look okay we can't</span> <span data-start="531.98" data-end="534.71">really see but it's pretty similar but</span> <span data-start="534.71" data-end="536.84">as we start getting into large response</span> <span data-start="536.84" data-end="546.06">sizes note sucks right node really sucks</span> <span data-start="546.07" data-end="550.52">your your that was like three seconds</span> <span data-start="550.52" data-end="553.67">well over three seconds four for a 256</span> <span data-start="553.67" data-end="556.61">kilobyte response that it's terrible</span> <span data-start="556.61" data-end="562.12">it's not rails terrible right I mean</span> <span data-start="562.12" data-end="566.21">this this is at 300 concurrent users at</span> <span data-start="566.21" data-end="568.34">the same time okay rails would be off</span> <span data-start="568.34" data-end="571.52">the map here but it's not it's it's a</span> <span data-start="571.52" data-end="573.83">different order of magnitude than these</span> <span data-start="573.83" data-end="576.47">other servers they're doing something</span> <span data-start="576.47" data-end="580.28">right and nodes doing something wrong so</span> <span data-start="580.28" data-end="582.65">so what's what's actually happening here</span> <span data-start="582.65" data-end="587.12">well v8 the the the virtual machine that</span> <span data-start="587.12" data-end="590.18">node runs on has this is very</span> <span data-start="590.18" data-end="592.91">complicated and has this generational</span> <span data-start="592.91" data-end="596.15">garbage collector so it moves data</span> <span data-start="596.15" data-end="600.92">around inside of its own heap and so v8</span> <span data-start="600.92" data-end="604.04">won't actually give you a pointer to the</span> <span data-start="604.04" data-end="606.59">data like the actual data of a string</span> <span data-start="606.59" data-end="609.98">you have to copy the data out of v8 into</span> <span data-start="609.98" data-end="612.68">your own heap outside of the vehicle and</span> <span data-start="612.68" data-end="615.32">then you can write it to socket so every</span> <span data-start="615.32" data-end="617.54">time node writes something to to a</span> <span data-start="617.54" data-end="620.21">socket it copies it out of v8 and then</span> <span data-start="620.21" data-end="625.28">copies it to the socket so I think in</span> <span data-start="625.28" data-end="631.28">the other web servers they can take</span> <span data-start="631.28" data-end="633.23">strings and write them directly to the</span> <span data-start="633.23" data-end="640.64">socket so to address this problem I've</span> <span data-start="640.64" data-end="645.28">added a buffer object to node which is</span> <span data-start="645.28" data-end="649.13">very simple it's just it's a chunk of</span> <span data-start="649.13" data-end="650.87">memory it's a chunk of memory that's</span> <span data-start="650.87" data-end="655.04">outside of v8s heap that you can modify</span> <span data-start="655.04" data-end="657.56">and write directly to the socket</span> <span data-start="657.56" data-end="660.98">and so this is what what the example</span> <span data-start="660.98" data-end="662.84">would look like with a with a buffer you</span> <span data-start="662.84" data-end="667.55">know it's it's binary data so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="667.55" data-end="669.32">look very string like but you can fill</span> <span data-start="669.32" data-end="672.35">it with data so so here where we create</span> <span data-start="672.35" data-end="675.08">a 16 kilobyte buffer and then we write</span> <span data-start="675.08" data-end="679.94">it to the socket so let's look at the</span> <span data-start="679.94" data-end="682.97">benchmark with the buffer now things</span> <span data-start="682.97" data-end="687.19">look ok actually things look really ok</span> <span data-start="687.19" data-end="691.13">over here with with the buffer note is</span> <span data-start="691.13" data-end="695.09">basically matching engine x4 speed which</span> <span data-start="695.09" data-end="696.38">is which is pretty impressive</span> <span data-start="696.38" data-end="698.69">considering that you know engine X is</span> <span data-start="698.69" data-end="702.71">this highly optimized C program and node</span> <span data-start="702.71" data-end="705.56">is this completely dynamic you know</span> <span data-start="705.56" data-end="707.86">things sitting written and java script</span> <span data-start="707.86" data-end="710.72">written sitting on top of this virtual</span> <span data-start="710.72" data-end="721.31">machine so so that's good yeah so so so</span> <span data-start="721.31" data-end="724.91">these buffers are pretty fast like node</span> <span data-start="724.91" data-end="727.58">can push these these buffers directly to</span> <span data-start="727.58" data-end="730.31">the socket and and it can it can do it</span> <span data-start="730.31" data-end="733.25">very well so if we just go back here and</span> <span data-start="733.25" data-end="735.8">we just took like a cross-section right</span> <span data-start="735.8" data-end="738.62">here at like the 256 kilobyte case and</span> <span data-start="738.62" data-end="741.26">and just looked at a histogram of of</span> <span data-start="741.26" data-end="745.43">these response times here just to get an</span> <span data-start="745.43" data-end="750.98">idea of how this looks
