yeah and</span> <span data-start="851.589" data-end="856.99">canvas</span> <span data-start="857" data-end="861.47">and let's draw yet we need the context</span> <span data-start="861.47" data-end="870.8">as well</span> <span data-start="870.81" data-end="876.12">so let's draw the image like the left</span> <span data-start="876.12" data-end="884.98">image oh yeah first of all</span> <span data-start="884.99" data-end="893.46">yeah I know it's ugly but it works right</span> <span data-start="893.47" data-end="899.51">yeah and we throw it in the same point</span> <span data-start="899.51" data-end="905.94">and the origin yeah and it works so now</span> <span data-start="905.95" data-end="911.779">hey come on thank you you can fit about</span> <span data-start="911.779" data-end="917.589">it and now we have also something like</span> <span data-start="917.589" data-end="927.13">image data so we can take the image data</span> <span data-start="927.13" data-end="931.58">from our canvas from whole canvas right</span> <span data-start="931.58" data-end="938.03">so</span> <span data-start="938.04" data-end="943.079">and then from the image day in data we</span> <span data-start="943.079" data-end="949.519">can take the data of each pixel so I</span> <span data-start="949.519" data-end="953.089">hope it was something like that and yeah</span> <span data-start="953.089" data-end="958.589">for now yeah okay no one I hope no one</span> <span data-start="958.589" data-end="966.029">will notice that yeah sure and now we</span> <span data-start="966.029" data-end="970.17">have an array with the pixels and yeah</span> <span data-start="970.17" data-end="975.35">and it done should be like that for sure</span> <span data-start="975.35" data-end="979.23">okay so the first element of the ra is</span> <span data-start="979.23" data-end="981.389">the red channel the second one is the</span> <span data-start="981.389" data-end="983.579">green channel then the third one is blue</span> <span data-start="983.579" data-end="987.149">the fourth one for ya then the next</span> <span data-start="987.149" data-end="989.579">after the third one is alpha channel and</span> <span data-start="989.579" data-end="993.899">so on so we want we are not interested</span> <span data-start="993.899" data-end="996.3">in here in the green or blue channel so</span> <span data-start="996.3" data-end="999.54">we just want to clear the red color from</span> <span data-start="999.54" data-end="1006.05">from the image ok and after that we want</span> <span data-start="1006.05" data-end="1016.519">to put that data that they turn into our</span> <span data-start="1016.519" data-end="1021.68">canvas yeah so that is the image without</span> <span data-start="1021.68" data-end="1026.99">the red color awesome and now yeah no</span> <span data-start="1026.99" data-end="1032.94">one will notice it again</span> <span data-start="1032.95" data-end="1035.5">we will yeah we don't need one that one</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1035.5" data-end="1039.19">I don't okay so now we create an array</span> <span data-start="1039.19" data-end="1041.65">it's like really big array because each</span> <span data-start="1041.65" data-end="1044.11">pixel is represented by four values in</span> <span data-start="1044.11" data-end="1061.79">here and we will remember or dead pixels</span> <span data-start="1061.8" data-end="1064.39">okay because we needed and we needed</span> <span data-start="1064.39" data-end="1074.14">after after that so we had our yeah good</span> <span data-start="1074.14" data-end="1080.74">cat I was testing you and now we will</span> <span data-start="1080.74" data-end="1089.62">draw another image like the right one</span> <span data-start="1089.63" data-end="1093.74">yeah I love jquery it's so easy to use</span> <span data-start="1093.74" data-end="1099.74">and just 70 k of code okay uh what's now</span> <span data-start="1099.74" data-end="1104.51">sure so we now draw another image the</span> <span data-start="1104.51" data-end="1112.84">red the right one okay yeah just just</span> <span data-start="1112.84" data-end="1119.03">testing if yeah sure and blah blah yeah</span> <span data-start="1119.03" data-end="1120.53">we made place it basically the same</span> <span data-start="1120.53" data-end="1123.26">thing in here after after drawing</span> <span data-start="1123.26" data-end="1135.99">another image but after that we will</span> <span data-start="1136" data-end="1138.92">leave the red pixel I don't yeah we</span> <span data-start="1138.92" data-end="1145.04">don't need to go</span> <span data-start="1145.05" data-end="1155.159">and we will clear that</span> <span data-start="1155.169" data-end="1160.249">okay and let's try if it will yeah it</span> <span data-start="1160.249" data-end="1162.379">works so now we have two images and we</span> <span data-start="1162.379" data-end="1164.989">have to combine them and we have to use</span> <span data-start="1164.989" data-end="1171.559">that magic formula from here so the</span> <span data-start="1171.559" data-end="1175.849">result coral color is like some thing of</span> <span data-start="1175.849" data-end="1184.46">two other colors yes so basically we had</span> <span data-start="1184.46" data-end="1194.239">the red pix link you sure and now but</span> <span data-start="1194.239" data-end="1197.599">the top color is our well notes like</span> <span data-start="1197.599" data-end="1208.249">that sure the top color is in here yeah</span> <span data-start="1208.249" data-end="1214.909">and the bottom color is that one</span> <span data-start="1214.919" data-end="1221.19">and it works like that for all the</span> <span data-start="1221.19" data-end="1232.36">channels</span> <span data-start="1232.37" data-end="1241.26">uh yeah I hope it will work and yeah</span> <span data-start="1241.27" data-end="1254.059">what I don't heard what do you work yeah</span> <span data-start="1254.059" data-end="1265.34">that's good cash in here yeah as I as I</span> <span data-start="1265.34" data-end="1280.92">said life coding is never yeah but still</span> <span data-start="1280.93" data-end="1295.68">yeah sure okay who cares</span> <span data-start="1295.69" data-end="1309.239">well it works</span> <span data-start="1309.249" data-end="1320.879">okay so let's back to the slides slides</span> <span data-start="1320.889" data-end="1323.809">and that Batman is also anaglyph i made</span> <span data-start="1323.809" data-end="1325.73">like i spend like three hours to find</span> <span data-start="1325.73" data-end="1333.379">them okay so yeah so basically what we</span> <span data-start="1333.379" data-end="1335.649">what we've done now we just clear</span> <span data-start="1335.649" data-end="1338.09">completely the red color from one chant</span> <span data-start="1338.09" data-end="1341.419">from the 1i view and the green and blue</span> <span data-start="1341.419" data-end="1343.429">from another one but not that's not the</span> <span data-start="1343.429" data-end="1346.159">only way to produce anaglyphs because we</span> <span data-start="1346.159" data-end="1348.169">have other types of anaglyph like</span> <span data-start="1348.169" data-end="1350.509">through anaglyph and it that's the</span> <span data-start="1350.509" data-end="1353.889">formula in here in which yeah you can</span> <span data-start="1353.889" data-end="1357.35">product that that was yeah I don't</span> <span data-start="1357.35" data-end="1358.97">really know what what this one was used</span> <span data-start="1358.97" data-end="1362.779">for but for example that gray anaglyphs</span> <span data-start="1362.779" data-end="1365.109">was used by NASA and to producing</span> <span data-start="1365.109" data-end="1367.129">three-dimensional images from that</span> <span data-start="1367.129" data-end="1371.69">photos I've I've already show you uh out</span> <span data-start="1371.69" data-end="1373.879">but yeah we don't have colors in here</span> <span data-start="1373.879" data-end="1377.259">also that is that is an agree if we use</span> <span data-start="1377.259" data-end="1381.71">the just with the simple values and that</span> <span data-start="1381.71" data-end="1385.1">is the optimized one and probably that</span> <span data-start="1385.1" data-end="1388.34">it has the best the best results and i</span> <span data-start="1388.34" data-end="1390.859">will show you one one demo after i don't</span> <span data-start="1390.859" data-end="1395.2">know 30 seconds so what's more we have</span> <span data-start="1395.2" data-end="1399.919">like anaglyphs in our browser so someone</span> <span data-start="1399.919" data-end="1402.739">creates a jquery plugin yeah it's not</span> <span data-start="1402.739" data-end="1404.389">the plug in its most likely more like a</span> <span data-start="1404.389" data-end="1421.45">snippet but</span> <span data-start="1421.46" data-end="1424.7">yeah and it looks like three-dimensional</span> <span data-start="1424.7" data-end="1426.409">tags but it's really hard to read it</span> <span data-start="1426.409" data-end="1432.409">from but but but it works like and they</span> <span data-start="1432.409" data-end="1436.72">were thing yeah so I showed you just</span> <span data-start="1436.72" data-end="1439.76">during just a couple of seconds ago the</span> <span data-start="1439.76" data-end="1442.61">optimized anaglyph and it's used in</span> </p>
