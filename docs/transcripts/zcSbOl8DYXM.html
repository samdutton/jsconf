<span data-start="479.22" data-end="482.36">convinced that they should be the same</span> <span data-start="482.36" data-end="484.32">so basically I was having problems with</span> <span data-start="484.32" data-end="485.58">like with a package to Jason you would</span> <span data-start="485.58" data-end="487.35">go to change a script and then that</span> <span data-start="487.35" data-end="488.58">would mean that you had to run npm</span> <span data-start="488.58" data-end="490.89">install again which seems like obviously</span> <span data-start="490.89" data-end="492.6">you know that you don't have to chain</span> <span data-start="492.6" data-end="494.73">run in p.m. install when you change the</span> <span data-start="494.73" data-end="496.8">script like that doesn't make sense but</span> <span data-start="496.8" data-end="498.48">because this is just looking at has the</span> <span data-start="498.48" data-end="500.43">file changed like if i copy a file into</span> <span data-start="500.43" data-end="504.45">the into the container and that files</span> <span data-start="504.45" data-end="506.7">changed and that invalidates the cache</span> <span data-start="506.7" data-end="509.52">for that level so this is why you'll see</span> <span data-start="509.52" data-end="510.87">this is a common pattern and people will</span> <span

data-end="536.43">complete docker file and this is a</span> <span data-start="536.43" data-end="538.53">docker file which would be able to run</span> <span data-start="538.53" data-end="540.66">our

data-end="553.83">super simple to build a a docker file</span> <span data-start="553.83" data-end="556.95">gonna just run docker build this — T is</span> <span data-start="556.95" data-end="558.57">a tag I'm gonna tag this image so I can</span> <span data-start="558.57" data-end="560.82">find it again you don't have to tag them</span> <span data-start="560.82" data-end="563.13">but then you just get like a hash that</span> <span data-start="563.13" data-end="565.5">refers to this build so it's difficult</span> <span data-start="565.5" data-end="567.93">to find it again and then thought just</span> <span data-start="567.93" data-end="569.82">means where should I build from what's</span> <span data-start="569.82" data-end="571.2">the context of the build and that's just</span> <span data-start="571.2" data-end="575.37">the current directory so first thing it</span> <span data-start="575.37" data-end="578.01">does is like figures out what files do I</span> <span data-start="578.01" data-end="580.43">need to send to the to the build and</span> <span data-start="580.43" data-end="582.42">you'll see that it skipped all the way</span> <span data-start="582.42" data-end="585.33">to step 6 straightaway and that's</span> <span data-start="585.33" data-end="589.17">because I've ran this before and the NPM</span> <span data-start="589.17" data-end="590.76">shrink-wrap dot jason hasn't changed</span> <span data-start="590.76" data-end="592.47">there aren't any new dependencies so we</span> <span data-start="592.47" data-end="594.09">can just reuse the last dependencies so</span> <span data-start="594.09" data-end="597.27">this is really nice like we can build we</span> <span data-start="597.27" data-end="599.28">can build this image and even if they've</span> <span data-start="599.28" data-end="603">been changes to our application code we</span> <span data-start="603" data-end="604.86">don't need to reinstall anything we</span> <span data-start="604.86" data-end="606.21">don't need to download node again none</span> <span data-start="606.21" data-end="615.24">of these things have changed okay so</span> <span data-start="615.24" data-end="617.55">let's let's run the image let's try</span> <span data-start="617.55" data-end="619.02">let's try out our application that we've</span> <span data-start="619.02" data-end="620.85">made so how do we do that</span> <span data-start="620.85" data-end="624.81">docker run this — IT means that we're</span> <span data-start="624.81" data-end="627">going to basically attach this terminal</span> <span data-start="627" data-end="630.27">sessions here into the terminal session</span> <span data-start="630.27" data-end="632.19">that's inside the container and reason</span> <span data-start="632.19" data-end="633.48">you have to do that is otherwise you</span> <span data-start="633.48" data-end="635.46">can't kill it which is frustrating for</span> <span data-start="635.46" data-end="639.63">demos then this next document — piece is</span> <span data-start="639.63" data-end="642">we're going to take the port 8000 that's</span> <span data-start="642" data-end="643.98">inside the container and map it to port</span> <span data-start="643.98" data-end="647.37">8000 outside the container next document</span> <span data-start="647.37" data-end="649.77">is the tag that's the image that we just</span> <span data-start="649.77" data-end="655.05">built and then I'm going to override the</span> <span data-start="655.05" data-end="658.56">command so I have basically this last</span> <span data-start="658.56" data-end="660.39">argument I'm going to run my dev command</span> <span data-start="660.39" data-end="662.91">and that's going to run instead of</span> <span data-start="662.91" data-end="665.61">running it with NPM start that's just</span> <span data-start="665.61" data-end="667.68">going to run load one so that we can</span> <span data-start="667.68" data-end="671.03">watch for changes</span> <span data-start="671.04" data-end="673.26">so application starts up watching for</span> <span data-start="673.26" data-end="682.95">changes great the problem is when I save</span> <span data-start="682.95" data-end="685.56">the file you know the application isn't</span> <span data-start="685.56" data-end="688.86">reloaded and the reason for that is</span> <span data-start="688.86" data-end="690.54">because this copy operation is a</span> <span data-start="690.54" data-end="692.34">one-time thing we copied the files into</span> <span data-start="692.34" data-end="694.17">the container but now the container is</span> <span data-start="694.17" data-end="696.48">done it's immutable it's not going to</span> <span data-start="696.48" data-end="698.94">pick up the changes from outside so this</span> <span data-start="698.94" data-end="700.56">is no good for development I mean we</span> <span data-start="700.56" data-end="703.35">could just stop it rebuild the image but</span> <span data-start="703.35" data-end="706.23">this is a really rubbish experience for</span> <span data-start="706.23" data-end="715.66">development so how can we fix that</span> <span data-start="715.67" data-end="717.779">so try doing it slightly different way</span> <span data-start="717.779" data-end="719.249">so exactly the same commanders before</span> <span data-start="719.249" data-end="722.189">but now we have this — V flag and what</span> <span data-start="722.189" data-end="723.269">that's going to do is create a volume</span> <span data-start="723.269" data-end="725.43">we're going to take the current working</span> <span data-start="725.43" data-end="727.98">directory and we're going to map that as</span> <span data-start="727.98" data-end="730.319">a file mount onto this code directory</span> <span data-start="730.319" data-end="731.519">which is where we're storing our code</span> <span data-start="731.519" data-end="735.93">that was the the working directory here</span> <span data-start="735.93" data-end="739.589">from before and so this is just like</span> <span data-start="739.589" data-end="744.12">taking the files the outside just like</span> <span data-start="744.12" data-end="746.43">in your in your on your regular file</span> <span data-start="746.43" data-end="748.86">system and they're going to act as like</span> <span data-start="748.86" data-end="751.139">a network drive or a file file share if</span> <span data-start="751.139" data-end="753.36">you like inside the container so that</span> <span data-start="753.36" data-end="756.42">now it has the real files and again</span> <span data-start="756.42" data-end="758.009">we're going to run node one so it can</span> <span data-start="758.009" data-end="768.059">pick up file changes and now when I hit</span> <span data-start="768.059" data-end="776.129">save node one rebuilds the files and if</span> <span data-start="776.129" data-end="784.639">we you can see if we have the new</span> <span data-start="784.639" data-end="786.99">message that I just typed in there so</span> <span data-start="786.99" data-end="789.6">we've got live reload working so this is</span> <span data-start="789.6" data-end="790.92">kind of the steps that we want so we</span> <span data-start="790.92" data-end="792.959">have our application running inside node</span> <span data-start="792.959" data-end="794.819">inside the docker container sorry</span> <span data-start="794.819" data-end="797">running node inside the docker container</span> <span data-start="797" data-end="799.92">and the live reload is working we can</span> <span data-start="799.92" data-end="802.439">just continue our development as we</span> <span data-start="802.439" data-end="808.829">always happen however it's going to be a</span> <span data-start="808.829" data-end="811.319">bit of a pain to just always be typing</span> <span data-start="811.319" data-end="813.089">these extra commands like the past in</span> <span data-start="813.089" data-end="815.069">these flags how can we how can we do</span> <span data-start="815.069" data-end="820.29">this nicer so the next step is to write</span> <span data-start="820.29" data-end="823.139">a compose file this is a file that's</span> <span data-start="823.139" data-end="825.179">interpreted by docker compose which is a</span> <span data-start="825.179" data-end="828.029">a tool that docker provides to run</span> <span data-start="828.029" data-end="830.67">multiple containers and what does that</span> <span data-start="830.67" data-end="835.35">look like</span> <span data-start="835.36" data-end="838.869">so dr. Campos file again is quite simple</span> <span data-start="838.869" data-end="840.579">it starts with version 2 because they</span> <span data-start="840.579" data-end="841.929">added some extra features which weren't</span> <span data-start="841.929" data-end="844.029">back backwards compatible so you can opt</span> <span data-start="844.029" data-end="847.989">into the new version of the file we're</span> <span data-start="847.989" data-end="849.73">going to define some services and the</span> <span data-start="849.73" data-end="851.619">service is just anything that you want</span> <span data-start="851.619" data-end="853.929">docker to start a container for so in</span> <span data-start="853.929" data-end="854.949">this case we're going to define a</span> <span data-start="854.949" data-end="858.1">service called API and then basically</span> <span data-start="858.1" data-end="860.049">each of these commands reflects the</span> <span data-start="860.049" data-end="861.519">parameters that we had to pass the</span> <span data-start="861.519" data-end="863.799">docker to configure it correctly to run</span> <span data-start="863.799" data-end="866.199">for development so we're going to build</span> <span data-start="866.199" data-end="868.54">from the current working directory dot</span> <span data-start="868.54" data-end="870.67">we're going to override the start</span> <span data-start="870.67" data-end="874.149">command this just runs node 1 we're</span> <span data-start="874.149" data-end="876.009">going to map the ports so that it's</span> <span data-start="876.009" data-end="879.399">visible outside outside of the container</span> <span data-start="879.399" data-end="882.189">and then we're going to do the same</span> <span data-start="882.189" data-end="885.699">trick with the volumes now there's one</span> <span data-start="885.699" data-end="887.379">problem with what the volume that I did</span> <span data-start="887.379" data-end="893.679">before and the reason the reason for</span> <span data-start="893.679" data-end="897.489">that is that the node modules which you</span> <span data-start="897.489" data-end="899.829">might have installed on your Mac for</span> <span data-start="899.829" data-end="902.769">example or on Windows they may have</span> <span data-start="902.769" data-end="904.299">binary dependencies which are built for</span> <span data-start="904.299" data-end="906.279">that platform and if you just copy your</span> <span data-start="906.279" data-end="908.86">node modules into this Linux environment</span> <span data-start="908.86" data-end="910.239">they're not going to work they're not</span> <span data-start="910.239" data-end="913.36">compiled for the right architecture so</span> <span data-start="913.36" data-end="916.119">what we do here and this is the biggest</span> <span data-start="916.119" data-end="917.439">leap of faith that you'll have to take</span> <span data-start="917.439" data-end="920.949">for this talk is we're going to we have</span> <span data-start="920.949" data-end="925.449">two volumes and we have the one that we</span> <span data-start="925.449" data-end="926.679">just used so that's the current</span> <span data-start="926.679" data-end="929.319">directory outside on the host that's</span> <span data-start="929.319" data-end="930.279">going to get mapped to this code</span> <span data-start="930.279" data-end="932.649">directory but then we're going to create</span> <span data-start="932.649" data-end="934.749">another volume this is a named volume</span> <span data-start="934.749" data-end="938.049">this is like a quite a new feature in in</span> <span data-start="938.049" data-end="940.569">docker which I'm defined down here and</span> <span data-start="940.569" data-end="942.579">there's no extra configuration for that</span> <span data-start="942.579" data-end="943.899">which just means it's going to create a</span> <span data-start="943.899" data-end="946.48">regular file volume using the default</span> <span data-start="946.48" data-end="948.669">driver and then we're going to map that</span> <span data-start="948.669" data-end="954.16">to a directory inside our other mount so</span> <span data-start="954.16" data-end="956.41">you have the docker container which has</span> <span data-start="956.41" data-end="957.61">its own file system that's isolated</span> <span data-start="957.61" data-end="960.309">we're going to mount inside of that our</span> <span data-start="960.309" data-end="963.339">files from our host and then inside of</span> <span data-start="963.339" data-end="966.22">that we're going to stub out like a safe</span> <span data-start="966.22" data-end="968.529">space for it to install the node modules</span> <span data-start="968.529" data-end="969.48">for its own</span> <span data-start="969.48" data-end="973.51">platform and that means that when we run</span> <span data-start="973.51" data-end="975.25">npm install inside the container</span> <span data-start="975.25" data-end="977.29">these node what these node modules will</span> <span data-start="977.29" data-end="979.6">end up inside this volume and they won't</span> <span data-start="979.6" data-end="984.7">get leaked outside back to your host and</span> <span data-start="984.7" data-end="987.37">so that allows us to if you want you can</span> <span data-start="987.37" data-end="991.12">even install run npm install on the host</span> <span data-start="991.12" data-end="993.28">have the node modules for mac there</span> <span data-start="993.28" data-end="995.26">which is sometimes useful for running</span> <span data-start="995.26" data-end="997.69">things like es lint or like your dev</span> <span data-start="997.69" data-end="999.88">dependencies and then inside the</span> <span data-start="999.88" data-end="1002.16">container all have the same dependencies</span> <span data-start="1002.16" data-end="1004.65">but compiled for the linux environment</span> <span data-start="1004.65" data-end="1007.74">that it runs in so that's how you can</span> <span data-start="1007.74" data-end="1009.18">get that to work and that allows you to</span> <span data-start="1009.18" data-end="1013.14">kind of not be locked in to developer</span> <span data-start="1013.14" data-end="1014.94">sort of developing in docker sometimes</span> <span data-start="1014.94" data-end="1017.04">it's easier to have those actual node</span> <span data-start="1017.04" data-end="1018.27">modules if you need to debug something</span> <span data-start="1018.27" data-end="1021.21">or whatever it works equally well if</span> <span data-start="1021.21" data-end="1023.07">you're going to be kind of careful and</span> <span data-start="1023.07" data-end="1025.05">commit to this run err always running</span> <span data-start="1025.05" data-end="1027.42">inside docker you can there's no problem</span> <span data-start="1027.42" data-end="1028.8">with just having these files being on</span> <span data-start="1028.8" data-end="1030.84">your hard drive the problem is if you</span> <span data-start="1030.84" data-end="1033.45">then try and run npm that's not going to</span> <span
