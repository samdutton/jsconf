data-start="290.26" data-end="292.57">statements isn't much better so a</span> <span data-start="292.57" data-end="295.27">psychologist damn place in came up with</span> <span data-start="295.27"

<span data-start="310.39" data-end="311.92">need to be flipped over to make sure</span> <span data-start="311.92" data-end="315.97">that this real checks out so formulate</span> <span data-start="315.97" data-end="321.31">your own answer so only four percent of</span> <span data-start="321.31" data-end="324.16">people got the right answer four percent</span> <span data-start="324.16" data-end="327.28">which is to flip only the a and the</span> <span data-start="327.28" data-end="329.47">seven over if you're stumped about why</span> <span data-start="329.47" data-end="331.15">this is right remember that the rule</span> <span data-start="331.15" data-end="333.25">says nothing about what has to be on the</span> <span data-start="333.25" data-end="336.94">other side of consonants so what does</span> <span data-start="336.94" data-end="339.37">this mean for testing our code properly</span> <span data-start="339.37" data-end="341.38">right if we can't come up with questions</span> <span data-start="341.38" data-end="344.65">to test rules that we hold to be true</span> <span data-start="344.65" data-end="346.72">how are you going to test our code and</span> <span data-start="346.72" data-end="348.64">what type of bugs are gonna arise from</span> <span data-start="348.64" data-end="352.3">this right but luckily there's some hope</span> <span data-start="352.3" data-end="354.33">which is that we get much better about</span> <span data-start="354.33" data-end="357.1">reasoning about concrete examples so</span> <span data-start="357.1" data-end="358.99">some other scientists adapted way since</span> <span data-start="358.99" data-end="361.93">for card task to test a concrete rule</span> <span data-start="361.93" data-end="364.51">which was that if a person is drinking</span> <span data-start="364.51" data-end="366.85">beer they must be over 19 years old and</span> <span data-start="366.85" data-end="368.65">in this case seventy-three percent of</span> <span data-start="368.65" data-end="370.48">people got the right answer so an</span> <span data-start="370.48" data-end="375.52">improvement but like still not great so</span> <span data-start="375.52" data-end="378.37">when we inevitably make a mistake in our</span> <span data-start="378.37" data-end="380.95">code logical or otherwise because after</span> <span data-start="380.95" data-end="383.77">all we are humans we're gonna have to</span> <span data-start="383.77" data-end="385.39">end up debugging our code and as</span> <span data-start="385.39" data-end="387.25">computer science elaborate e brian</span> <span data-start="387.25" data-end="389.26">kernighan said debugging is twice as</span> <span data-start="389.26" data-end="391.36">hard as writing the program in the first</span> <span data-start="391.36" data-end="394.36">place so why exactly is debugging so</span> <span data-start="394.36" data-end="397.03">hard I think there's some cognitive bias</span> <span data-start="397.03" data-end="399.82">ezel will help or not helping us to</span> <span data-start="399.82" data-end="402.37">debug well one of them is a confirmation</span> <span data-start="402.37" data-end="404.9">bias which is that we have a tendency</span> <span data-start="404.9" data-end="407.419">to search for interpret favor and</span> <span data-start="407.419" data-end="409.1">remember information in a way that</span> <span data-start="409.1" data-end="411.38">confirms our pre-existing beliefs or</span> <span data-start="411.38" data-end="413.06">hypotheses we also give</span> <span data-start="413.06" data-end="415.46">disproportionately less consideration to</span> <span data-start="415.46" data-end="418.49">alternative possibilities so an</span> <span data-start="418.49" data-end="421.4">experiment to test this Wayson did it</span> <span data-start="421.4" data-end="426.41">again and so for instance they gave a</span> <span data-start="426.41" data-end="428.27">trio participants a trade-off numbers</span> <span data-start="428.27" data-end="431">like 246 and told the participants that</span> <span data-start="431" data-end="432.56">the trio couldn't form to a specific</span> <span data-start="432.56" data-end="434.479">rule and their job was to figure out</span> <span data-start="434.479" data-end="436.43">what the rule was by asking if other</span> <span data-start="436.43" data-end="438.74">trios also informed the rule in this</span> <span data-start="438.74" data-end="440.449">case is actually pretty simple that the</span> <span data-start="440.449" data-end="441.979">numbers just have to be in a sending</span> <span data-start="441.979" data-end="444.32">order but people ended up having trouble</span> <span data-start="444.32" data-end="446">especially when they asked only</span> <span data-start="446" data-end="447.56">confirming questions and not</span> <span data-start="447.56" data-end="449.539">disconfirming questions if you were to</span> <span data-start="449.539" data-end="451.94">say like oh I got the rule it's like</span> <span data-start="451.94" data-end="456.83">does 6 8 10 apply like yep you would</span> <span data-start="456.83" data-end="458">probably just keep going down the same</span> <span data-start="458" data-end="459.32">path but if you're like I'm gonna try</span> <span data-start="459.32" data-end="462.05">something different one to a million and</span> <span data-start="462.05" data-end="464.18">they said yeah that also it works then</span> <span data-start="464.18" data-end="466.039">you have more insight into what the rule</span> <span data-start="466.039" data-end="470.93">actually is but we tend to scrutinize</span> <span data-start="470.93" data-end="472.91">disconfirming evidence we try to find</span> <span data-start="472.91" data-end="475.639">flaws or ambiguities in in this evidence</span> <span data-start="475.639" data-end="478.49">blaming say when you're like when it</span> <span data-start="478.49" data-end="480.8">relates to code a bug in the library or</span> <span data-start="480.8" data-end="482.449">it was someone else's code that has the</span> <span data-start="482.449" data-end="484.28">bug in it and even when the facts are</span> <span data-start="484.28" data-end="486.71">clearly stacked up against the belief</span> <span data-start="486.71" data-end="488.63">that we are holding true we often throw</span> <span data-start="488.63" data-end="490.789">out those disconfirming facts especially</span> <span data-start="490.789" data-end="493.729">when the issue is emotionally charged</span> <span data-start="493.729" data-end="496.36">such as when your code has a bug in it</span> <span data-start="496.36" data-end="499.61">we also tend to be rigid in how we</span> <span data-start="499.61" data-end="502.729">approach problems so if you write the</span> <span data-start="502.729" data-end="504.44">wrote the code you're going to be rigid</span> <span data-start="504.44" data-end="507.199">and stinking thinking through the the</span> <span data-start="507.199" data-end="508.61">problem and it's going to be hard to</span> <span data-start="508.61" data-end="510.44">think outside the box and squash the bug</span> <span data-start="510.44" data-end="512.479">especially if it's on a conceptual level</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="512.479" data-end="515">I know I'm guilty of substituting the</span> <span data-start="515" data-end="516.65">single equals four triple equals and</span> <span data-start="516.65" data-end="518.69">even that type of bug is hard to find so</span> <span data-start="518.69" data-end="520.58">when the bug is on a more conceptual</span> <span data-start="520.58" data-end="523.82">level it's that much harder to find and</span> <span data-start="523.82" data-end="526.61">squash and we even sometimes tend to</span> <span data-start="526.61" data-end="528.77">block problem solutions based on past</span> <span data-start="528.77" data-end="531.47">experiences because we have an inability</span> <span data-start="531.47" data-end="533.06">to see problems from a fresh perspective</span> <span data-start="533.06" data-end="535.459">I think a great way to get around this</span> <span data-start="535.459" data-end="537.9">is to pair on squishing bugs so</span> <span data-start="537.9" data-end="540.84">you get that extra set of eyes when</span> <span data-start="540.84" data-end="544.68">you're particularly stuck another thing</span> <span data-start="544.68" data-end="546.42">that's so frustrating about debugging is</span> <span data-start="546.42" data-end="548.52">that sometimes it feels

<span data-start="552.03" data-end="554.67">working it's frustrating then there's no</span> <span data-start="554.67" data-end="556.95">light at the end of the tunnel and this</span> <span data-start="556.95" data-end="558.84">is because we often have no idea when</span> <span data-start="558.84" data-end="560.85">we're going to solve a problem even the</span> <span data-start="560.85" data-end="562.83">30 seconds before we end up solving it</span> <span data-start="562.83" data-end="565.5">and so to test the scientists give</span> <span data-start="565.5" data-end="567.45">subjects

the</span> <span data-start="573.27" data-end="575.55">scientists ask them as the participants</span> <span data-start="575.55" data-end="577.47">to rate their progress in terms of</span> <span

data-end="865.62">wide array of situations not just</span> <span data-start="865.62" data-end="868.23">planning our software projects so people</span> <span data-start="868.23" data-end="870.69">tend

that</span> <span data-start="971.85" data-end="975.57">contrast is off so yeah like a switch</span> <span data-start="975.57" data-end="977.73">from English to German goes unnoticed</span> <span

data-start="1254.48" data-end="1257.96">not gonna make good software if you</span> <span data-start="1257.96" data-end="1259.429">don't realize how much more you have to</span> <span

data-start="1272.69" data-end="1275.21">skilled people often underestimate their</span> <span data-start="1275.21" data-end="1277.22">abilities and think that tasks that are</span> <span

data-start="1290.509" data-end="1291.86">going to ask questions that are</span> <span data-start="1291.86" data-end="1294.2">important to making good software going</span> <span data-start="1294.2" data-end="1295.46">to ask things that you're not really</span> <span data-start="1295.46" data-end="1299.57">thinking about anymore so if you if you</span> <span data-start="1299.57" data-end="1301.61">dismiss their questions they're not</span> <span data-start="1301.61" data-end="1302.869">going to ask them any more and then your</span> <span data-start="1302.869" data-end="1304.7">software isn't going to be as good as it</span> <span data-start="1304.7" data-end="1307.19">could be but this this can also manifest</span> <span data-start="1307.19" data-end="1309.139">in a different way and if you attended</span> <span data-start="1309.139" data-end="1311.69">the last talk an imposter syndrome you</span> <span data-start="1311.69" data-end="1313.399">know what impostor syndrome is the the</span> <span data-start="1313.399" data-end="1316.759">short of it is that people sometimes</span> <span data-start="1316.759" data-end="1319.1">think that their accomplishments and</span> <span data-start="1319.1" data-end="1321.08">their achievements are the result of</span> <span data-start="1321.08" data-end="1323.6">luck timing deception like they pulled</span> <span data-start="1323.6" data-end="1325.009">the wool over someone's eyes they don't</span> <span data-start="1325.009" data-end="1327.74">deserve what they have when in fact they</span> <span data-start="1327.74" data-end="1330.049">probably do and some studies suggest</span> <span data-start="1330.049" data-end="1332.029">that this is particularly common among</span> <span data-start="1332.029" data-end="1334.519">high-achieving women but across the</span> <span data-start="1334.519" data-end="1335.36">board even</span> <span data-start="1335.36" data-end="1338.059">of the best programmers I know suffer</span> <span data-start="1338.059" data-end="1344.87">from imposter syndrome so we're working</span> <span data-start="1344.87" data-end="1346.52">with people and we're working with the</span> <span data-start="1346.52" data-end="1348.71">team so how do we assemble the best team</span> <span data-start="1348.71" data-end="1350.12">and how are these cognitive biases</span> <span data-start="1350.12" data-end="1352.25">getting in the way of us assembling the</span> <span data-start="1352.25" data-end="1354.23">best team possible I think one of the</span> <span data-start="1354.23" data-end="1355.67">things getting in the way is that we</span> <span data-start="1355.67" data-end="1357.47">tend to favor members of our own in</span> <span data-start="1357.47" data-end="1361.28">group so and this is getting in the way</span> <span data-start="1361.28" data-end="1362.75">especially with those like referral</span> <span data-start="1362.75" data-end="1365.99">bonuses right you you get a lot of money</span> <span data-start="1365.99" data-end="1368.059">for referring people in your social</span> <span data-start="1368.059" data-end="1369.29">circles that you think you're good</span> <span data-start="1369.29" data-end="1372.679">programmers but if our social social</span> <span data-start="1372.679" data-end="1374.9">circles tend to look like us you're just</span> <span data-start="1374.9" data-end="1376.7">going to refer them so if i were to</span> <span data-start="1376.7" data-end="1379.07">refer people who looked like me my team</span> <span data-start="1379.07" data-end="1380.48">would just be a bunch of white women and</span> <span data-start="1380.48" data-end="1384.11">that's not good either so we want to not</span> <span data-start="1384.11" data-end="1388.4">do that so another thing getting in our</span> <span data-start="1388.4" data-end="1389.75">way is called the fundamental</span> <span data-start="1389.75" data-end="1392.48">attribution error so people have a</span> <span data-start="1392.48" data-end="1394.7">tendency to attribute situations to</span> <span data-start="1394.7" data-end="1396.86">other people's character rather than to</span> <span data-start="1396.86" data-end="1399.08">external factors so a classic example of</span> <span data-start="1399.08" data-end="1401.63">this is like you're driving down the</span> <span data-start="1401.63" data-end="1403.97">street being a law abiding and driving</span> <span data-start="1403.97" data-end="1405.559">the right speed limit and then all of a</span> <span data-start="1405.559" data-end="1407.15">sudden someone like rushes past you and</span> <span data-start="1407.15" data-end="1409.429">you're like ah what a jerk they're like</span> <span data-start="1409.429" data-end="1411.049">breaking all the laws and they're</span> <span data-start="1411.049" data-end="1412.64">causing a dangerous situation on the</span> <span data-start="1412.64" data-end="1416.03">road but maybe in fact they're driving a</span> <span data-start="1416.03" data-end="1417.32">loved one to the hospital and they're</span> <span data-start="1417.32" data-end="1419.21">they're not really thinking about laws</span> <span data-start="1419.21" data-end="1420.95">they're just thinking about their loved</span> <span

data-start="1424.64" data-end="1427.34">to have empathy for that person and it</span> <span data-start="1427.34" data-end="1428.6">has nothing to do with they're not like</span> <span data-start="1428.6" data-end="1434.63">a jerk actually so this also happens on</span> <span data-start="1434.63" data-end="1436.669">a larger scale something called the</span> <span data-start="1436.669" data-end="1438.71">group attribution error so people have a</span> <span data-start="1438.71" data-end="1441.5">tendency to believe that attributes of a</span> <span data-start="1441.5" data-end="1443.419">group member reflects the entire group</span> <span data-start="1443.419" data-end="1446.63">so I thought this was well explained by</span> <span

data-end="1459.26">actually on the left nah I'm below</span> <span data-start="1459.26" data-end="1462.62">average in which direction is which so</span> <span data-start="1462.62" data-end="1466.52">on one side you see two dudes one who</span> <span data-start="1466.52" data-end="1468.29">apparently is not great at math</span> <span data-start="1468.29" data-end="1471.11">and his friend is saying why do you suck</span> <span data-start="1471.11" data-end="1475.46">at math on the right we see a dude and a</span> <span data-start="1475.46" data-end="1478.43">woman and the woman apparently is not</span> <span data-start="1478.43" data-end="1482">good at math and the guy is saying wow</span> <span data-start="1482" data-end="1486.05">girls suck at math so why does this why</span> <span data-start="1486.05" data-end="1489.2">is this kind of true um but studies have</span> <span data-start="1489.2" data-end="1491.78">shown that the the group attribution</span> <span data-start="1491.78" data-end="1493.97">error is stronger and perceptions of</span> <span data-start="1493.97" data-end="1495.56">groups that are viewed as more too</span> <span data-start="1495.56" data-end="1498.86">similar to once owned and this doesn't</span> <span data-start="1498.86" data-end="1500.33">really happen with perceptions of our</span> <span data-start="1500.33"

data-start="1636.36" data-end="1638.49">we're at a programming meet up it's very</span> <span data-start="1638.49" data-end="1640.17">likely that people at programming</span> <span data-start="1640.17" data-end="1642.81">meetups are programmers but people have</span> <span data-start="1642.81" data-end="1643.77">come up to him in like are you a</span> <span data-start="1643.77" data-end="1647.67">designer are you a recruiter like no I'm</span> <span data-start="1647.67" data-end="1649.32">at a programming meetup of a programmer</span> <span data-start="1649.32" data-end="1656.13">it's like not good Oh so um might it be</span> <span data-start="1656.13" data-end="1657.21">able to tell them kind of talking about</span> <span data-start="1657.21" data-end="1659.82">diversity here um so like why is</span> <span data-start="1659.82" data-end="1662.52">diversity important for assembling good</span> <span data-start="1662.52" data-end="1665.88">team and creating good software well so</span> <span data-start="1665.88" data-end="1667.71">i mentioned that creativity is all about</span> <span data-start="1667.71" data-end="1669.81">collective is about associative memory</span> <span data-start="1669.81" data-end="1673.17">so when you have a diverse team you're</span> <span data-start="1673.17" data-end="1676.67">going to have a wider array of of</span> <span data-start="1676.67" data-end="1680.18">experiences of backgrounds of interests</span> <span data-start="1680.18" data-end="1683.07">and therefore you're going to have</span> <span data-start="1683.07" data-end="1685.62">better collective associative memory and</span> <span data-start="1685.62" data-end="1686.55">therefore you're going to be more</span> <span data-start="1686.55" data-end="1687.84">creative you're going to find better</span> <span data-start="1687.84" data-end="1689.61">solutions to problems that's going to</span> <span data-start="1689.61" data-end="1692.55">lead to better software so what can we</span> <span data-start="1692.55" data-end="1695.94">do about all of this right so first off</span> <span data-start="1695.94" data-end="1698.13">like don't feel bad your brains are like</span> <span data-start="1698.13" data-end="1701.06">literally programmed to do this because</span> <span data-start="1701.06" data-end="1705.03">like back in the day we were just</span> <span data-start="1705.03" data-end="1707.85">supposed to like escape predators but</span> <span data-start="1707.85" data-end="1710.76">now we are sitting at computers thinking</span> <span data-start="1710.76" data-end="1713.46">all day so it's a little different so</span> <span data-start="1713.46" data-end="1715.52">like the quicker that you can think the</span> <span data-start="1715.52" data-end="1717.24">quicker you're going to get away from</span> <span data-start="1717.24" data-end="1720.33">that tiger that's chasing you and you're</span> <span data-start="1720.33" data-end="1723.09">going to have more cognitive economy so</span> <span data-start="1723.09" data-end="1725.49">this thinking fast system is called</span> <span data-start="1725.49" data-end="1728.46">system one in the literature and the</span> <span data-start="1728.46" data-end="1730.83">thinking slow system is called system to</span> <span data-start="1730.83" data-end="1732.15">in the literature and if you might have</span> <span data-start="1732.15" data-end="1735.21">read a book or heard of a book by this</span> <span data-start="1735.21" data-end="1735.69">title</span> <span data-start="1735.69" data-end="1737.549">making fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman</span> <span data-start="1737.549" data-end="1740.639">so like what can we do about this right</span> <span data-start="1740.639" data-end="1742.86">like we're as I said we are literally</span> <span data-start="1742.86" data-end="1745.169">sitting there and thinking our job is to</span> <span data-start="1745.169" data-end="1747.299">think and we usually take a really long</span> <span data-start="1747.299" data-end="1749.549">time to think through very hard problems</span> <span data-start="1749.549" data-end="1752.34">so if we just take that same amount of</span> <span data-start="1752.34" data-end="1754.049">time and apply them to things that we</span> <span data-start="1754.049" data-end="1756.33">might not think about as much just take</span> <span data-start="1756.33" data-end="1757.889">another hour to make those hard</span> <span data-start="1757.889" data-end="1760.649">decisions then we're probably going to</span> <span data-start="1760.649" data-end="1763.08">end up making better software that more</span> <span data-start="1763.08" data-end="1764.58">humans can use and we're going to end up</span> <span data-start="1764.58" data-end="1768.47">making these things with happier humans</span> <span data-start="1768.47" data-end="1772.11">so thanks for listening that's me and</span> <span data-start="1772.11" data-end="1774.149">all my emoji friends you can find my</span> <span
