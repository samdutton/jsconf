data-end="255.72">physics of light so here you see it's</span> <span data-start="255.72" data-end="257.789">very simple scene we have this little</span> <span data-start="257.789" data-end="262.74">apartment it works okay and we have we</span> <span data-start="262.74" data-end="264.96">see a computer or standing on a desk we</span> <span data-start="264.96" data-end="266.28">have a chair we</span> <span data-start="266.28" data-end="268.95">a window and outside we have the Sun</span> <span data-start="268.95" data-end="272.49">which is primarily the source of light</span> <span data-start="272.49" data-end="275.31">which makes us see everything but how</span> <span data-start="275.31" data-end="278.85">does it actually work so every light</span> <span data-start="278.85" data-end="280.889">source for now we're talking about the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="280.889" data-end="284.1">Sun is emitting race of electromagnetic</span> <span data-start="284.1" data-end="289.889">waves as soon as these rays are hitting</span> <span data-start="289.889" data-end="293.01">an object they are going to interact</span> <span data-start="293.01" data-end="297.33">with that object so either the object is</span> <span data-start="297.33" data-end="300.12">absorbing all the light in that case a</span> <span data-start="300.12" data-end="303.75">lot of energy is being produced or parts</span> <span data-start="303.75" data-end="305.669">of the ray of the Sun are gonna be</span> <span data-start="305.669" data-end="309.63">bouncing off and reflecting on different</span> <span data-start="309.63" data-end="312.72">surfaces until that light energy is used</span> <span data-start="312.72" data-end="317.16">up I already said that the lecture</span> <span data-start="317.16" data-end="319.62">magnetic waves consisting of different</span> <span data-start="319.62" data-end="321.419">frequencies so that means different</span> <span data-start="321.419" data-end="325.08">frequencies are different colors if one</span> <span data-start="325.08" data-end="327.6">frequency is absorbed the other of two</span> <span data-start="327.6" data-end="330.45">frequencies are going to hit our eye the</span> <span data-start="330.45" data-end="332.64">retina of our eye therefore creating</span> <span data-start="332.64" data-end="339.64">this color in our eyes and we can see it</span> <span data-start="339.65" data-end="341.76">different materials react very</span> <span data-start="341.76" data-end="344.43">differently which I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="344.43" data-end="346.86">about the differences afterwards but</span> <span data-start="346.86" data-end="349.02">there is three major things as I said</span> <span data-start="349.02" data-end="351.72">already its absorption reflection and</span> <span data-start="351.72" data-end="355.35">transmission of light we could say this</span> <span data-start="355.35" data-end="358.31">here a little bit more graphically</span> <span data-start="358.31" data-end="362.01">imagine you have a perfect mirror which</span> <span data-start="362.01" data-end="364.86">is even it's not possible even if we</span> <span data-start="364.86" data-end="367.53">polish your surface very well you're</span> <span data-start="367.53" data-end="368.97">never going to have it but theoretically</span> <span data-start="368.97" data-end="372.72">a perfect mirror will reflect all the</span> <span data-start="372.72" data-end="377.24">light rays uniformly this we call</span> <span data-start="377.24" data-end="381.06">specular reflection then we have diffuse</span> <span data-start="381.06" data-end="385.77">material like cloth and like wood and</span> <span data-start="385.77" data-end="387.99">other things that are not so much</span> <span data-start="387.99" data-end="391.83">reflective so it's gonna take the race</span> <span data-start="391.83" data-end="394.83">and bounce them back in a very chaotic</span> <span data-start="394.83" data-end="400.05">way and you have propagated light so</span> <span data-start="400.05" data-end="403.05">if you have glass or water the light is</span> <span data-start="403.05" data-end="405.449">not only gonna reflect it's also gonna</span> <span data-start="405.449" data-end="410.22">transmit through the solid creating</span> <span data-start="410.22" data-end="414.69">these really cool effects so with this</span> <span data-start="414.69" data-end="416.159">is of course not everything that defines</span> <span data-start="416.159" data-end="418.74">a material but as we can see in this</span> <span data-start="418.74" data-end="423.03">illustration these three components make</span> <span data-start="423.03" data-end="426.8">a lot of our real-life materials and</span> <span data-start="426.8" data-end="430.699">it's never just one component that is</span> <span data-start="430.699" data-end="435.479">there in one material for example if you</span> <span data-start="435.479" data-end="438.75">imagine about if you imagine you have a</span> <span data-start="438.75" data-end="442.259">wooden floor that is not polished the</span> <span data-start="442.259" data-end="444.03">the rays of light are going to bounce</span> <span data-start="444.03" data-end="446.819">back chaotically but if you then put a</span> <span data-start="446.819" data-end="450">polish or finish on it's going to be</span> <span data-start="450" data-end="452.419">very shiny from specific angles and</span> <span data-start="452.419" data-end="454.71">that's what I really want you to think</span> <span data-start="454.71" data-end="456.449">about when he gets started with 3d</span> <span data-start="456.449" data-end="458.43">because that's what a lot of people get</span> <span data-start="458.43" data-end="461.25">wrong or just don't think about because</span> <span data-start="461.25" data-end="465.63">why would you so how do we now translate</span> <span data-start="465.63" data-end="470.159">this into computer graphics I would like</span> <span data-start="470.159" data-end="474.599">to just go back to a few centuries back</span> <span data-start="474.599" data-end="477.33">where the first cameras were appearing</span> <span data-start="477.33" data-end="481.11">and these are called pinhole cameras so</span> <span data-start="481.11" data-end="483.12">you have a light-sensitive film on the</span> <span data-start="483.12" data-end="486.84">back of a box with a little hole inside</span> <span data-start="486.84" data-end="492.09">and only one ray of light per angle is</span> <span data-start="492.09" data-end="494.21">allowed to pass through that hole</span> <span data-start="494.21" data-end="497.639">creating then the color on that spot of</span> <span data-start="497.639" data-end="504.15">the of the film and we are also using</span> <span data-start="504.15" data-end="507.719">this technique in the render engine</span> <span data-start="507.719" data-end="509.61">technique called ray tracing and that's</span> <span data-start="509.61" data-end="514.949">what I'm gonna talk about however if you</span> <span data-start="514.949" data-end="517.38">imagine again the Sun it's not only</span> <span data-start="517.38" data-end="520.469">shooting one ray at the time it's like a</span> <span data-start="520.469" data-end="522.719">really really big energy source and it's</span> <span data-start="522.719" data-end="524.73">shooting down all these billions and</span> <span data-start="524.73" data-end="526.74">billions of race at the same time and</span> <span data-start="526.74" data-end="529.41">most of these rays are never gonna hit</span> <span data-start="529.41" data-end="531.69">our eye they're never going to hit our</span> <span data-start="531.69" data-end="533.55">camera or whatever specifics</span> <span data-start="533.55" data-end="536.31">but that we want to look at so what</span> <span data-start="536.31" data-end="539.01">computer graphics are doing is they use</span> <span data-start="539.01" data-end="541.8">technique called backwards ray tracing</span> <span data-start="541.8" data-end="544.649">so we are tracing the race but instead</span> <span data-start="544.649" data-end="546.69">of going from the light source we're</span> <span data-start="546.69" data-end="549.72">going from our camera through the pixel</span> <span data-start="549.72" data-end="552.209">that we want to trace and we should</span> <span data-start="552.209" data-end="555.269">array into the scene and we look at the</span> <span data-start="555.269" data-end="557.01">first object that we're going to hit at</span> <span data-start="557.01" data-end="560.22">the closest one from there we're going</span> <span data-start="560.22" data-end="563.25">to see we want to see if this one object</span> <span data-start="563.25" data-end="577.11">is in shadow or if it is in light okay</span> <span data-start="577.11" data-end="582.089">so if the object is actually lit we're</span> <span data-start="582.089" data-end="584.61">going to use the color of the of the</span> <span data-start="584.61" data-end="587.12">material that is defined at that space</span> <span data-start="587.12" data-end="589.62">basically multiplying it simple</span> <span data-start="589.62" data-end="592.56">simplified set multiplying it with the</span> <span data-start="592.56" data-end="594.839">color of the light intensity of the</span> <span data-start="594.839" data-end="598.47">light if the object is in shadow we're</span> <span data-start="598.47" data-end="601.56">just going to use we're just going to</span> <span data-start="601.56" data-end="605.31">use black for now as for shadow this is</span> <span data-start="605.31" data-end="609.209">very simplified but now I also talked</span> <span data-start="609.209" data-end="611.49">about these other things that called</span> <span data-start="611.49" data-end="615.93">like transmission and reflection so how</span> <span data-start="615.93" data-end="618.38">are we handling this in ray tracing</span> <span data-start="618.38" data-end="624.81">imagine we want to see where if we have</span> <span data-start="624.81" data-end="628.829">a transparent material like glass we</span> <span data-start="628.829" data-end="631.47">would like to see what can we see</span> <span data-start="631.47" data-end="633.6">through that glass and what is reflected</span> <span data-start="633.6" data-end="636.72">on the surface of that glass so on the</span> <span data-start="636.72" data-end="640.17">impact point we have to calculate the</span> <span data-start="640.17" data-end="642.41">different race that we're going to trace</span> <span data-start="642.41" data-end="645.209">one of those rays is going to be the</span> <span data-start="645.209" data-end="648.209">reflection ray and one of them is going</span> <span data-start="648.209" data-end="651.51">to be the refraction ray it's a bit yeah</span> <span data-start="651.51" data-end="653.459">not very nice that the names are so</span> <span data-start="653.459" data-end="657.6">close and from there these rays we're</span> <span data-start="657.6" data-end="659.07">going to do another check if they are</span> <span data-start="659.07" data-end="661.98">hitting a next object so if the</span> <span data-start="661.98" data-end="663.899">reflection ray is hitting this red</span> <span data-start="663.899" data-end="666.93">sphere it's going to be red at that</span> <span data-start="666.93" data-end="670.08">points but the refraction rays hitting</span> <span data-start="670.08" data-end="672.899">this green sphere and so we have to</span> <span data-start="672.899" data-end="676.26">calculate together if we want to have to</span> <span data-start="676.26" data-end="680.31">pixel their red or green from the impact</span> <span data-start="680.31" data-end="683.49">point of the secondary race we're going</span> <span data-start="683.49" data-end="686.43">to trace to towards the Sun and see if</span> <span data-start="686.43" data-end="692.64">these points are in light or not I want</span> <span data-start="692.64" data-end="694.95">you to have a moment to look at this</span> <span data-start="694.95" data-end="710.31">code</span> <span data-start="710.32" data-end="714.89">everybody get it can you come here and</span> <span data-start="714.89" data-end="717.8">explain it to me because this is how I</span> <span data-start="717.8" data-end="719.84">feel about my own code after two weeks</span> <span data-start="719.84" data-end="724.4">of not looking at it so yeah what you're</span> <span data-start="724.4" data-end="727.04">looking at is a basic implementation of</span> <span data-start="727.04" data-end="729.08">a ray tracing engine that can do</span> <span data-start="729.08" data-end="731.68">reflection reflection and reflect</span> <span data-start="731.68" data-end="736.22">refraction with geometry primitives of</span> <span data-start="736.22" data-end="739.28">spheres and I'm not sure if planes as</span> <span data-start="739.28" data-end="742.34">well I think only spheres and this is a</span> <span data-start="742.34" data-end="745.13">common challenge and young people who do</span> <span data-start="745.13" data-end="747.41">computer graphics is how to make the</span> <span data-start="747.41" data-end="750.05">most compact ray tracing engine that can</span> <span data-start="750.05" data-end="754.52">be fit on a business card so this</span> <span data-start="754.52" data-end="756.38">actually compiles and I think that's</span> <span data-start="756.38" data-end="758.9">pretty cool but let's take it apart a</span> <span data-start="758.9" data-end="762.35">little bit so what we want to do is we</span> <span data-start="762.35" data-end="765.65">want to define our geometry primitives</span> <span data-start="765.65" data-end="768.56">and for now we are just going to talk</span> <span data-start="768.56" data-end="770.24">about the sphere because the sphere is</span> <span data-start="770.24" data-end="772.88">one of the most easy shapes to calculate</span> <span data-start="772.88" data-end="776.66">an intersection and for that we need a</span> <span data-start="776.66" data-end="779.06">center and radius and we want to have</span> <span data-start="779.06" data-end="780.92">the material because as I explained</span> <span data-start="780.92" data-end="782.86">before that's the most interesting part</span> <span data-start="782.86" data-end="786.44">and we're going to make an algorithm</span> <span data-start="786.44" data-end="788.15">that will calculate our intersection</span> <span data-start="788.15" data-end="791.48">from that if we are successful we're</span> <span data-start="791.48" data-end="795.02">going to return both points that are</span> <span data-start="795.02" data-end="796.67">intersecting with the sphere because</span> <span data-start="796.67" data-end="799.13">usually you will have two of them so the</span> <span data-start="799.13" data-end="802.16">the distance to the the closest one and</span> <span data-start="802.16" data-end="804.29">the distance to this to the further away</span> <span data-start="804.29" data-end="809.86">one then we're gonna start our main</span> <span data-start="809.86" data-end="812.21">function and we're going to define the</span> <span data-start="812.21" data-end="814.48">geometries and again for simplification</span> <span data-start="814.48" data-end="817.25">our light source are also going to be</span> <span data-start="817.25" data-end="820.04">spheres just with a different material</span> <span data-start="820.04" data-end="823.85">that actually emits light for that we</span> <span data-start="823.85" data-end="826.43">can test afterwards we're gonna have a</span> <span data-start="826.43" data-end="829.61">buffer for our canvas and we're going to</span> <span data-start="829.61" data-end="831.71">go and Traverse through each pixel and</span> <span data-start="831.71" data-end="834.77">for and we're gonna trace for each pixel</span> <span data-start="834.77" data-end="838.45">one ray that's what we did before right</span> <span data-start="838.45" data-end="842.18">then in the trace function I want to see</span> <span data-start="842.18" data-end="843.26">again</span> <span data-start="843.26" data-end="845.24">shoot this is the primary ray that we</span> <span data-start="845.24" data-end="848.33">talked about before and we want to see</span> <span data-start="848.33" data-end="850.67">which is the closest object so we're</span> <span data-start="850.67" data-end="852.92">gonna we're gonna test the Ray against</span> <span data-start="852.92" data-end="857.24">every object in the sea and as a result</span> <span data-start="857.24" data-end="859.58">we get the nearest one back if we don't</span> <span data-start="859.58" data-end="861.2">have one hit at all we could just return</span> <span data-start="861.2" data-end="863.27">the background color because there is</span> <span data-start="863.27" data-end="867.14">nothing there and there will never be</span> <span data-start="867.14" data-end="868.79">something there that's the really cool</span> <span data-start="868.79" data-end="870.71">thing about ray tracing you actually</span> <span data-start="870.71" data-end="873.92">test against the whole scene if there is</span> <span data-start="873.92" data-end="877.25">an object there and it's a transparent</span> <span data-start="877.25" data-end="881.54">or a reflective material we're gonna</span> <span data-start="881.54" data-end="884.45">have to to shoot the secondary rays for</span> <span data-start="884.45" data-end="888.05">each of those and we do this recursively</span> <span data-start="888.05" data-end="891.98">until we are satisfied and usually you</span> <span data-start="891.98" data-end="893.6">don't want to do this endlessly because</span> <span data-start="893.6" data-end="896.33">it's gonna take forever so we're gonna</span> <span data-start="896.33" data-end="899.27">decide how often you want to do this</span> <span data-start="899.27" data-end="902.03">recursion and at the end of that you</span> <span data-start="902.03" data-end="904.16">will test against the lights and see if</span> <span data-start="904.16" data-end="908.69">these points are in shadow or not then</span> <span data-start="908.69" data-end="911.09">you're gonna use a fernell algorithm to</span> <span data-start="911.09" data-end="913.52">see how you should calculate the lights</span> <span data-start="913.52" data-end="915.95">together or the results of the colors</span> <span data-start="915.95" data-end="917.54">you're getting I'm not going to explain</span> <span data-start="917.54" data-end="919.34">that right now but it's very interesting</span> <span data-start="919.34" data-end="922.94">to look at and if it doesn't fall into</span> <span data-start="922.94" data-end="925.91">this that means we are hitting a light</span> <span data-start="925.91" data-end="928.58">source or a diffuse material that is not</span> <span data-start="928.58" data-end="931.46">going to reflect any different points so</span> <span data-start="931.46" data-end="934.25">we can break the recursion there I did</span> <span data-start="934.25" data-end="936.2">not make another slide for this because</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="936.2" data-end="939.14">I think it's clear and this is the</span> <span data-start="939.14" data-end="946.62">result that we are getting from this I</span> <span data-start="946.63" data-end="949.07">think it's very interesting to see that</span> <span data-start="949.07" data-end="953.99">from this rather simple algorithm we</span> <span data-start="953.99" data-end="957.5">already get really cool effects like we</span> <span data-start="957.5" data-end="959.72">can really see the spheres that are</span> <span data-start="959.72" data-end="960.64">close to each other</span> <span data-start="960.64" data-end="964.43">reflecting each other we can see shadows</span> <span data-start="964.43" data-end="967.43">and we can also see what's behind the</span> <span data-start="967.43" data-end="969.23">camera which is pretty cool</span> <span data-start="969.23" data-end="973.1">and this is something that you do not</span> <span data-start="973.1" data-end="977.329">generally see in games for example or in</span> <span data-start="977.329" data-end="981.489">different render engines and why is that</span> <span data-start="981.489" data-end="984.04">we're gonna get to that later on</span> <span data-start="984.04" data-end="988.819">so this was really easy I think but now</span> <span data-start="988.819" data-end="991.91">we want to really go realistic because</span> <span data-start="991.91" data-end="994.579">we said before there is not one ray per</span> <span data-start="994.579" data-end="997.399">pixel usually the Sun shoot so many rays</span> <span data-start="997.399" data-end="1000.04">that make up one pixel of your image</span> <span data-start="1000.04" data-end="1002.23">there is so many things that come</span> <span data-start="1002.23" data-end="1005.499">together we want to have soft shadows we</span> <span data-start="1005.499" data-end="1008.259">want to use multiple light sources how</span> <span data-start="1008.259" data-end="1010.679">are we going to compute these together</span> <span data-start="1010.679" data-end="1014.769">how are we going to decide on what is</span> <span data-start="1014.769" data-end="1018.459">more weighted which pixel should be what</span> <span data-start="1018.459" data-end="1021.249">and we really want to have this physical</span> <span data-start="1021.249" data-end="1024.549">correctness which means that we have to</span> <span data-start="1024.549" data-end="1028.209">basically bounce the array forever until</span> <span data-start="1028.209" data-end="1031.389">it hits the light source by itself right</span> <span data-start="1031.389" data-end="1033.909">now we're just making it a shortcut</span> <span data-start="1033.909" data-end="1036.339">because we just test if it's if it will</span> <span data-start="1036.339" data-end="1038.799">be hitting the light or not if there is</span> <span data-start="1038.799" data-end="1042.909">something in-between or not this is</span> <span data-start="1042.909" data-end="1044.559">going to use a lot of computational</span> <span data-start="1044.559" data-end="1048">power ray tracing is really old</span> <span data-start="1048" data-end="1051.46">technique it's from the knife from 1984</span> <span data-start="1051.46" data-end="1054.909">was the first sake graph conference that</span> <span data-start="1054.909" data-end="1058.659">was taking this as a topic and since</span> <span data-start="1058.659" data-end="1061.36">then we are still not there where we</span> <span data-start="1061.36" data-end="1065.139">have real time ray traced and she is</span> <span data-start="1065.139" data-end="1067.929">that are engines that are working it has</span> <span data-start="1067.929" data-end="1070.72">a lot to do with this that you cannot</span> <span data-start="1070.72" data-end="1073.029">make shortcuts to make it look good</span> <span data-start="1073.029" data-end="1075.789">you have to have a certain amount of</span> <span data-start="1075.789" data-end="1077.86">samples unless you're gonna have a</span> <span data-start="1077.86" data-end="1080.23">really otherwise you can have a really</span> <span data-start="1080.23" data-end="1088.12">noisy scenery so we have a lot of new</span> <span data-start="1088.12" data-end="1090.039">light sources in the room that are also</span> <span data-start="1090.039" data-end="1094.96">casting Ray's I would like to just very</span> <span data-start="1094.96" data-end="1098.049">briefly introduce to you rasterization</span> <span data-start="1098.049" data-end="1100.179">technique this is the most common</span> <span data-start="1100.179" data-end="1103.179">real-time render engine technique that</span> <span data-start="1103.179" data-end="1106.72">is being used and it's just as ray</span> <span data-start="1106.72" data-end="1109">tracing just it's just as fundamental</span> <span data-start="1109" data-end="1110.71">this technique it has been around</span> <span data-start="1110.71" data-end="1112.299">almost the same time because when</span> <span data-start="1112.299" data-end="1114.58">ray-tracing was introduced the</span> <span data-start="1114.58" data-end="1117.01">computational power was not good enough</span> <span data-start="1117.01" data-end="1119.26">or not strong enough it would have taken</span> <span data-start="1119.26" data-end="1122.649">them forever to render one frame of an</span> <span data-start="1122.649" data-end="1128.679">animated movie for example so what's</span> <span data-start="1128.679" data-end="1132.13">interesting about rasterization is that</span> <span data-start="1132.13" data-end="1134.14">it's also trying to solve the visibility</span> <span data-start="1134.14" data-end="1136.27">problem it's also trying to find out</span> <span data-start="1136.27" data-end="1138.52">which object object is laying in shadow</span> <span data-start="1138.52" data-end="1145.39">or what's the color of it but it's doing</span> <span data-start="1145.39" data-end="1147.6">it in a very opposite way of ray tracing</span> <span data-start="1147.6" data-end="1149.89">while the ray tracing is going from the</span> <span data-start="1149.89" data-end="1154.11">eye or from the camera into the scene</span> <span data-start="1154.11" data-end="1157.179">rasterization is going from the objects</span> <span data-start="1157.179" data-end="1161.049">or from the scenery onto the screen due</span> <span data-start="1161.049" data-end="1164.22">to perspective projection so we take all</span> <span data-start="1164.22" data-end="1168.789">the numbers and all our points and all</span> <span data-start="1168.789" data-end="1171.399">our vertices everything and we project</span> <span data-start="1171.399" data-end="1175.419">it onto the screen for this we it's</span> <span data-start="1175.419" data-end="1178.51">currently using triangles which is also</span> <span data-start="1178.51" data-end="1180.94">a rendering primitive the cool thing</span> <span data-start="1180.94" data-end="1183.159">about triangles is you cannot subdivide</span> <span data-start="1183.159" data-end="1185.02">it anymore it's already you cannot make</span> <span data-start="1185.02" data-end="1188.86">more areas out of it and the areas is</span> <span data-start="1188.86" data-end="1191.62">always planner so we never have like a</span> <span data-start="1191.62" data-end="1195.76">perspective warp or something which</span> <span data-start="1195.76" data-end="1200.049">makes it really cool to then project and</span> <span data-start="1200.049" data-end="1204.7">test what we then do with it with the</span> <span data-start="1204.7" data-end="1206.47">triangles that are mapped onto screen</span> <span data-start="1206.47" data-end="1210.159">space is something that also shown has</span> <span data-start="1210.159" data-end="1212.02">been talking about before we were</span> <span data-start="1212.02" data-end="1215.649">rasterizing each pixel for each triangle</span> <span data-start="1215.649" data-end="1218.5">that is visible and we mapped their sea</span> <span data-start="1218.5" data-end="1220.57">value so how far it is away from the</span> <span data-start="1220.57" data-end="1223.299">camera so that afterwards when we color</span> <span data-start="1223.299" data-end="1225.46">it in we know what's on top of each</span> <span data-start="1225.46" data-end="1228.94">other and if you have transparency then</span> <span data-start="1228.94" data-end="1231.58">we have to consider the C buffer because</span> <span data-start="1231.58" data-end="1233.2">that's how we're going to put it</span> <span data-start="1233.2" data-end="1238.179">together which also tells us that the Z</span> <span data-start="1238.179" data-end="1240.309">buffer is basically so a transparent</span> <span data-start="1240.309" data-end="1243.07">object is basically just look through</span> <span data-start="1243.07" data-end="1244.75">with a different</span> <span data-start="1244.75" data-end="1247.35">our value which does not have this</span> <span data-start="1247.35" data-end="1250.24">refraction rays that are kind of warped</span> <span data-start="1250.24" data-end="1256.03">around in the scene so here in this</span> <span data-start="1256.03" data-end="1259.06">image you can see two basic</span> <span data-start="1259.06" data-end="1261.73">implementations one basic implementation</span> <span data-start="1261.73" data-end="1264.01">of rasterization and the basic</span> <span data-start="1264.01" data-end="1266.89">implementation of ray tracing and you</span> <span data-start="1266.89" data-end="1276.74">can already see the difference I think</span> <span data-start="1276.75" data-end="1280.18">while rasterization has come a really</span> <span data-start="1280.18" data-end="1282.7">long way if you have played any 3d games</span> <span data-start="1282.7" data-end="1285.43">recently or if you are working with VR</span> <span data-start="1285.43" data-end="1287.74">you're gonna know that it's not going to</span> <span data-start="1287.74" data-end="1290.74">look like the image up there so there is</span> <span data-start="1290.74" data-end="1293.52">a lot of simulations of real physics</span> <span data-start="1293.52" data-end="1296.59">happening in restoration but generally</span> <span data-start="1296.59" data-end="1300.67">this implementation is also really a lot</span> <span data-start="1300.67" data-end="1305.31">of work to do to simulate these physics</span> <span data-start="1305.31" data-end="1308.41">but they are doing a pretty good job the</span> <span data-start="1308.41" data-end="1310.33">only problem is still transparency I</span> <span data-start="1310.33" data-end="1314.98">think so just a quick overview of the</span> <span data-start="1314.98" data-end="1318.13">two ray tracing is mostly physically</span> <span data-start="1318.13" data-end="1319.84">correct if you put enough effort in it</span> <span data-start="1319.84" data-end="1324.19">it has very high details very nice side</span> <span data-start="1324.19" data-end="1325.75">effects that you don't have to think</span> <span data-start="1325.75" data-end="1328.36">about you get the soft shadows you get</span> <span data-start="1328.36" data-end="1330.58">the inter reflections you get the</span> <span data-start="1330.58" data-end="1333.46">caustics but it's very computationally</span> <span data-start="1333.46" data-end="1337.63">heavy so we are going to use a lot of</span> <span data-start="1337.63" data-end="1340.84">computation time to render frames and if</span> <span data-start="1340.84" data-end="1343.15">we ever want to do this real time we're</span> <span data-start="1343.15" data-end="1346.12">gonna either have to break it down or we</span> <span data-start="1346.12" data-end="1350.56">have to make cuts and restoration is</span> <span data-start="1350.56" data-end="1353.95">super fast it's really only one</span> <span data-start="1353.95" data-end="1356.02">transformation basically from your world</span> <span data-start="1356.02" data-end="1358.99">world coordinates to your screens space</span> <span data-start="1358.99" data-end="1361.48">coordinates there's a lot of tooling and</span> <span data-start="1361.48" data-end="1363.79">hardware support so your GPU and your</span> <span data-start="1363.79"

data-end="1378.64">they're still rendering ray tracing</span> <span data-start="1378.64" data-end="1382.54">with CPUs because it doesn't matter to</span> <span data-start="1382.54" data-end="1384.31">them if there are three times faster or</span> <span data-start="1384.31" data-end="1386.56">not in what matters is that they have to</span> <span data-start="1386.56" data-end="1388.84">change all their their tools and they</span> <span data-start="1388.84" data-end="1391.05">have to change their engines to be</span> <span data-start="1391.05" data-end="1395.89">supportive of GPUs for just a little</span> <span data-start="1395.89" data-end="1401.29">benefit so you have the physics that are</span> <span data-start="1401.29" data-end="1403.42">not really correct you have like an</span> <span data-start="1403.42" data-end="1405.57">approximation of what you can do and you</span> <span data-start="1405.57" data-end="1412.09">have quality loss due to that so this is</span> <span data-start="1412.09" data-end="1414.82">kind of the point where I hope you are</span> <span data-start="1414.82" data-end="1416.98">all oh god how should I even get started</span> <span data-start="1416.98" data-end="1419.8">it seems very complicated so I would</span> <span data-start="1419.8" data-end="1423.04">like to introduce you a frame toolkit</span> <span data-start="1423.04" data-end="1427.78">and a frame is a web toolkit where you</span> <span data-start="1427.78" data-end="1429.64">can really easily get started with</span> <span data-start="1429.64" data-end="1432.7">making your own 3d scenes and if you're</span> <span data-start="1432.7" data-end="1435.64">a fan of HTML you're gonna be really</span> <span data-start="1435.64" data-end="1438.01">happy because this is what its gonna</span> <span data-start="1438.01" data-end="1443.05">look like so you can define with HTML</span> <span data-start="1443.05" data-end="1445.57">tags we basically define everything you</span> <span data-start="1445.57" data-end="1448.99">define your scene you define the sky you</span> <span data-start="1448.99" data-end="1451.33">can put sources and if you want to use a</span> <span data-start="1451.33" data-end="1454.63">sky texture if you prefer to use a sky</span> <span data-start="1454.63" data-end="1457.72">color then you can put a color then you</span> <span data-start="1457.72" data-end="1460.51">have this geometry primitives as you</span> <span data-start="1460.51" data-end="1464.5">have usually boxes spheres cubes</span> <span data-start="1464.5" data-end="1468.4">whatever planes are also very prominent</span> <span data-start="1468.4" data-end="1472.81">and you can also define the lights and</span> <span data-start="1472.81" data-end="1474.61">that's where we come back to the</span> <span data-start="1474.61" data-end="1478.45">beginning because with this components</span> <span data-start="1478.45" data-end="1481.99">you're gonna make or break your scene if</span> <span data-start="1481.99" data-end="1484.42">your lightning is good sorry lighting</span> <span data-start="1484.42" data-end="1489.34">it's good you're gonna have you can</span> <span data-start="1489.34" data-end="1491.7">really achieve a lot by just having</span> <span data-start="1491.7" data-end="1495.46">three or four or five different objects</span> <span data-start="1495.46" data-end="1499.45">in the scene and the best part of a</span> <span data-start="1499.45" data-end="1501.85">frame is that it comes with webviewer</span> <span data-start="1501.85" data-end="1504.07">integration so you don't have to do</span> <span data-start="1504.07" data-end="1506.83">anything you just lean back you import</span> <span data-start="1506.83" data-end="1509.71">your wife controls or every major</span> <span data-start="1509.71" data-end="1512.38">headset is supported or so mostly</span> <span data-start="1512.38" data-end="1514.03">every major headset controller is</span> <span data-start="1514.03" data-end="1518.59">supported so this is what that example</span> <span data-start="1518.59" data-end="1524.62">would look like once it is but that did</span> <span data-start="1524.62" data-end="1527.02">not look very good I mean the background</span> <span data-start="1527.02" data-end="1532.81">does but the foreground so it's still</span> <span data-start="1532.81" data-end="1534.64">the big question in the room is how do I</span> <span data-start="1534.64" data-end="1538.06">get my 3d models and that's where also</span> <span data-start="1538.06" data-end="1542.05">we come in so for example this is gonna</span> <span data-start="1542.05" data-end="1545.05">be in your head of your HTML you load</span> <span data-start="1545.05" data-end="1547.54">all these external components they're</span> <span data-start="1547.54" data-end="1550.18">called a frame components and I think</span> <span data-start="1550.18" data-end="1552.07">the open-source community is really</span> <span data-start="1552.07" data-end="1554.5">doing an amazing job here because you</span> <span data-start="1554.5" data-end="1556.9">have all these really cool components</span> <span data-start="1556.9" data-end="1559.9">like a frame orbit controls you have</span> <span data-start="1559.9" data-end="1561.7">people that are building environment</span> <span data-start="1561.7" data-end="1564.52">presets for you so you can just import</span> <span data-start="1564.52" data-end="1566.29">them and say I would like to use this</span> <span data-start="1566.29" data-end="1568.57">preset and then afterwards you can</span> <span data-start="1568.57" data-end="1572.91">always use animation of each attributes</span> <span data-start="1572.91" data-end="1577.39">to to change your scene the way you want</span> <span data-start="1577.39" data-end="1580.09">and you can if you don't like HTML you</span> <span data-start="1580.09" data-end="1582.37">can do that with JavaScript so you can</span> <span data-start="1582.37" data-end="1586.12">just edit edit your HTML attributes</span> <span data-start="1586.12" data-end="1589.32">programmatically to make them animate</span> <span data-start="1589.32" data-end="1591.94">and this is how you're going to use the</span> <span data-start="1591.94" data-end="1593.59">a frame components that are made by</span> <span data-start="1593.59" data-end="1597.52">external parties for example if you can</span> <span data-start="1597.52" data-end="1600.91">load a 3d i/o furniture of your choice</span> <span data-start="1600.91" data-end="1603.73">you can position it because position</span> <span data-start="1603.73" data-end="1606.01">attributes are just generally used for</span> <span data-start="1606.01" data-end="1610.6">each object and you can you can have</span> <span data-start="1610.6" data-end="1613.63">your camera rotating around that object</span> <span data-start="1613.63" data-end="1617.02">and you had this really nice background</span> <span data-start="1617.02" data-end="1620.77">that you loved so much and you just want</span> <span data-start="1620.77" data-end="1623.77">to lay in that bed and with the VR</span> <span data-start="1623.77" data-end="1628.66">headset yeah so this I think it's really</span> <span data-start="1628.66" data-end="1630.16">cool and you should definitely try it</span> <span data-start="1630.16" data-end="1632.98">out because there is so many amazing</span> <span data-start="1632.98" data-end="1635.97">things that people are doing with this I</span> <span data-start="1635.97" data-end="1638.32">would like to share with you like a few</span> <span data-start="1638.32" data-end="1640.33">tips and tricks this would just be a</span> <span data-start="1640.33" data-end="1642.64">talk on its own but this is what I have</span> <span data-start="1642.64" data-end="1645.85">been asked most of the times again how</span> <span data-start="1645.85" data-end="1646.06">do</span> <span data-start="1646.06" data-end="1648.85">get my 3d content should I go now and</span> <span data-start="1648.85" data-end="1652.09">start to learn blender because that's a</span> <span data-start="1652.09" data-end="1653.83">pretty frustrating tool to learn</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1653.83" data-end="1656.05">I know it's I've worked a lot with</span> <span data-start="1656.05" data-end="1658.99">blender but it's pretty powerful however</span> <span data-start="1658.99" data-end="1661.45">you don't have to do that because some</span> <span data-start="1661.45" data-end="1663.79">people like my coworker Thomas I'm</span> <span data-start="1663.79" data-end="1664.9">writing</span> <span data-start="1664.9" data-end="1667.54">inspector plugin for a-frame so a-frame</span> <span data-start="1667.54" data-end="1669.22">has a 3d inspector where you can</span> <span data-start="1669.22" data-end="1671.53">manipulate your scene drag around things</span> <span data-start="1671.53" data-end="1673.84">try out your values that you then can</span> <span data-start="1673.84" data-end="1677.38">pour it into your HTML file and you can</span> <span data-start="1677.38" data-end="1680.17">use this inspector plug-in to get models</span> <span data-start="1680.17" data-end="1684.13">from for example Google blocks I just</span> <span data-start="1684.13" data-end="1684.97">try it out</span> <span data-start="1684.97" data-end="1688.87">scale the models have fun with it then</span> <span data-start="1688.87" data-end="1691.99">lightning not lightning why do I always</span> <span data-start="1691.99" data-end="1695.44">say lightning lightning it's gonna make</span> <span data-start="1695.44" data-end="1699.73">or break your scene so I think it makes</span> <span data-start="1699.73" data-end="1702.04">a really big difference and if you're</span> <span data-start="1702.04" data-end="1705.73">interested in this I have hi motivations</span> <span data-start="1705.73" data-end="1709.14">to write blog posts about this topic and</span> <span data-start="1709.14" data-end="1712.21">then for the end is content optimization</span> <span data-start="1712.21" data-end="1715">we are people that work mostly with the</span> <span data-start="1715" data-end="1719.86">web and with different devices so if you</span> <span data-start="1719.86" data-end="1722.31">start working with 3d for a project</span> <span data-start="1722.31" data-end="1725.68">think about what is your target group if</span> <span data-start="1725.68" data-end="1729.55">you want to use 3d on different devices</span> <span data-start="1729.55" data-end="1732.19">at the same time keep in mind that you</span> <span data-start="1732.19" data-end="1735.01">might want to design it differently for</span> <span data-start="1735.01" data-end="1737.23">whatever you want to do if you want to</span> <span data-start="1737.23" data-end="1739.99">do a fast-paced game then you have to</span> <span data-start="1739.99" data-end="1743.56">maybe not be so detailed but if you want</span> <span data-start="1743.56" data-end="1746.95">to do product like you want to have a 3d</span> <span data-start="1746.95" data-end="1749.98">scene of your product to try to sell you</span> <span data-start="1749.98" data-end="1753.18">might want to be more detailed on that</span> <span data-start="1753.18" data-end="1756.52">so you should be thinking about loading</span> <span data-start="1756.52" data-end="1759.34">your assets progressively that means you</span> <span data-start="1759.34" data-end="1761.44">could have your textures in different</span> <span data-start="1761.44" data-end="1763.99">sizes or different formats depending on</span> <span data-start="1763.99" data-end="1767.76">what your device is capable of doing and</span> <span data-start="1767.76" data-end="1771.07">you should design for level of detail if</span> <span data-start="1771.07"

data-end="1779.72">make it have a million polygons please</span> <span data-start="1779.72" data-end="1782.97">and these are all the lessons that we</span> <span data-start="1782.97" data-end="1786.48">have for free from game development also</span> <span data-start="1786.48" data-end="1789.72">one other lesson that we are actually</span> <span data-start="1789.72" data-end="1794">doing or that I was working on is we do</span> <span data-start="1794" data-end="1798.39">use ray tracing for calculating light</span> <span data-start="1798.39"

also</span> <span data-start="1817.5" data-end="1822">really cool workarounds so one two</span> <span data-start="1822" data-end="1825.27">takeaways and then I'm done models</span> <span
