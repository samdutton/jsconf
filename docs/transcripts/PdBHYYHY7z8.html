data-end="698.25">using bittorrent over like shitty</span> <span data-start="698.25" data-end="700.56">network right and like this thing is</span> <span data-start="700.56" data-end="702.69">totally usable I can do like LS here and</span> <span data-start="702.69" data-end="704.97">like it has to fish LS but of course I</span> <span data-start="704.97" data-end="709.05">haven't synced that right and you can</span> <span data-start="709.05" data-end="711.44">even like you can you can even run node</span> <span data-start="711.44" data-end="714.75">and it'll start it fits that so you can</span> <span data-start="714.75" data-end="715.92">see down here in the big I don't know if</span> <span data-start="715.92" data-end="716.88">you can see it but like it's trying to</span> <span data-start="716.88" data-end="718.2">fetch known all the dependencies which</span> <span data-start="718.2" data-end="721.2">is like lip standard C++ that's probably</span> <span data-start="721.2" data-end="727.92">cool inshare ripe and in a second it</span> <span data-start="727.92" data-end="732.15">will have that first so basically the</span> <span data-start="732.15" data-end="733.86">idea is that we just fetch what is</span> <span data-start="733.86" data-end="735.18">needed we don't need to fetch all these</span> <span data-start="735.18" data-end="736.59">five hundred forty megabytes and like</span> <span data-start="736.59" data-end="738.81">while we're running this thing like oven</span> <span data-start="738.81" data-end="740.19">the top corner is also seeding the image</span> <span data-start="740.19" data-end="742.2">right so if someone else tries to put my</span> <span data-start="742.2" data-end="743.97">machine we now have two peers if that</span> <span data-start="743.97" data-end="745.77">guy tries to run it we now have three</span> <span data-start="745.77" data-end="748.05">piers and like you know it's spreading</span> <span data-start="748.05" data-end="750.21">like crazy right which is really really</span> <span data-start="750.21" data-end="752.28">cool so we got note and we can run note</span> <span data-start="752.28" data-end="754.56">now so that's cool so like imagine going</span> <span data-start="754.56" data-end="757.11">back to the original example like a</span> <span data-start="757.11" data-end="759.45">female's dislike so we can basically do</span> <span data-start="759.45" data-end="761.82">like that cat that could be like it</span> <span data-start="761.82" data-end="764.55">let's do it alive right</span> <span data-start="764.55" data-end="767.62">and like you could run into torn darker</span> <span data-start="767.62" data-end="772.24">here so basically you can using this</span> <span data-start="772.24" data-end="773.5">kind of thing you could you could have</span> <span data-start="773.5" data-end="775.06">like a debt that contains like a</span> <span data-start="775.06" data-end="776.8">terabyte of data typing into a sucker</span> <span data-start="776.8" data-end="779.11">image that's like a gigabyte but it all</span> <span data-start="779.11" data-end="780.85">put in like seconds so I think that's</span> <span data-start="780.85" data-end="785.08">pretty cool anyways that lasted talker</span> <span data-start="785.08" data-end="788.01">stuff I'm just a sub sector here right</span> <span data-start="788.01" data-end="790.06">are you talking about replication right</span> <span data-start="790.06" data-end="791.89">right so I won't talk too much about it</span> <span data-start="791.89" data-end="794.26">but like just that so this is part of</span> <span data-start="794.26" data-end="795.91">our big replication scheme like we want</span> <span data-start="795.91" data-end="797.2">to view up the time we want to do stuff</span> <span data-start="797.2" data-end="800.77">like that we also in the process of</span> <span data-start="800.77" data-end="803.62">discussing how do we actually like how</span> <span data-start="803.62" data-end="805.6">do you

have</span> <span data-start="809.14" data-end="810.28">a kid and you can push to each other and</span> <span data-start="810.28" data-end="812.26">that's kind of cool so we were just I'm</span> <span data-start="812.26" data-end="813.85">just going to pre flea talk about what</span> <span data-start="813.85" data-end="815.92">we're trying to do there and kind of</span> <span data-start="815.92" data-end="817.18">make the scenes of subscribe to do this</span> <span data-start="817.18" data-end="820.54">thing so like we wanted to be able to do</span> <span data-start="820.54" data-end="821.83">kind of like the same sort of things</span> <span data-start="821.83" data-end="823.93">like get up doing is doing with baby</span> </p>
