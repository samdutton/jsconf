basically</span> <span data-start="198.43" data-end="204.639">looks a bit like this excuse me so it's</span> <span data-start="204.639" data-end="208.09">got just a few properties really it's</span> <span data-start="208.09" data-end="214.209">got an ID that identify it my controller</span> <span data-start="214.209" data-end="216.76">here is saying I'm a standard gamepad</span> <span data-start="216.76" data-end="219.43">from this vendor it's this product I'm</span> <span data-start="219.43" data-end="221.049">sure there's a list of those vendor and</span> <span data-start="221.049" data-end="222.34">product code somewhere I couldn't find</span> <span data-start="222.34" data-end="225.79">it then it's got an index you can</span> <span data-start="225.79" data-end="227.23">actually hook up multiple gamepads your</span> <span data-start="227.23" data-end="228.519">browser will recognize multiple gamepad</span> <span data-start="228.519" data-end="230.379">so you know if I could clone myself and</span> <span data-start="230.379" data-end="232">the controller I could like play against</span> <span data-start="232" data-end="234.84">myself on the other side of the machine</span> <span data-start="234.84" data-end="237.459">it's got a time stamp which tells you</span> <span data-start="237.459" data-end="240.18">something about when it was last updated</span> <span data-start="240.18" data-end="243.19">and then the rest is basic telling you</span> <span data-start="243.19" data-end="244.87">what state to the gamepad is it's got</span> <span data-start="244.87" data-end="249.599">four axes which corresponds to the</span> <span data-start="249.599" data-end="254.5">sticks and it's got an array of 17</span> <span data-start="254.5" data-end="256.51">buttons which is basically everything</span> <span data-start="256.51" data-end="259.599">else and it's probably a little bit</span> <span data-start="259.599" data-end="262.87">easier to just visualize it like this so</span> <span data-start="262.87" data-end="265.949">the buttons you can push the buttons</span> <span data-start="265.949" data-end="271.03">lots of buttons you can push multiple</span> <span data-start="271.03" data-end="272.919">buttons at the same time it'll register</span> <span data-start="272.919" data-end="275.38">that you also got access to these</span> <span data-start="275.38" data-end="278.169">control buttons in the middle and with</span> <span data-start="278.169" data-end="279.669">the sticks you can sort of move things</span> <span data-start="279.669" data-end="282.46">up and down back and forth you can use</span> <span data-start="282.46" data-end="286.07">both sticks and</span> <span data-start="286.08" data-end="288.87">it's really actually quite easy to set</span> <span data-start="288.87" data-end="293.099">up if you have quick look at some code</span> <span data-start="293.099" data-end="299.87">here it's not big enough can you see it</span> <span data-start="299.87" data-end="303.659">yep cool so the first step is to get the</span> <span data-start="303.659" data-end="309.27">connection to the gamepad this is</span> <span data-start="309.27" data-end="311.789">currently not a standard so it's not</span> <span data-start="311.789" data-end="313.62">currently implemented exactly the same</span> <span data-start="313.62" data-end="317.46">in oh hang on a skip the slide in though</span> <span data-start="317.46" data-end="322.44">does that skipped forward backwards a</span> <span data-start="322.44" data-end="324.5">little bit it's a little bit of a bug</span> <span data-start="324.5" data-end="326.34">anyway let's have a little bit of a look</span> <span data-start="326.34" data-end="327.87">at browser compatibility before we move</span> <span data-start="327.87" data-end="330.599">to the actual code itself so I was</span> <span data-start="330.599" data-end="332.569">saying this is not quite standard yet</span> <span data-start="332.569" data-end="336.24">it's a little bit flaky and safari and</span> </p>

data-start="340.68" data-end="342.9">implemented from what I've seen there's</span> <span data-start="342.9" data-end="344.669">no immediate plans to implement any of</span> <span data-start="344.669" data-end="349.439">it it's a matrix here because it's not</span> <span data-start="349.439" data-end="352.889">just the browser the online operating</span> <span data-start="352.889"

data-end="360.87">keyboards anymore that you need to</span> <span data-start="360.87" data-end="363.029">install drivers for you know back in the</span> <span data-start="363.029" data-end="364.65">day when you bought a new fancy keyboard</span> <span data-start="364.65" data-end="365.969">you actually had to install the driver</span> <span data-start="365.969"

data-end="381.87">because Windows is the primary gaming</span> <span data-start="381.87" data-end="389.009">platform for pc it's bit sad OSX as you</span> <span data-start="389.009"

data-end="396.33">presentation is a bit wobbly and kind of</span> <span data-start="396.33" data-end="401.069">flaky this controller here is using some</span> <span data-start="401.069" data-end="403.199">xbox controller driver that some guy I</span> <span data-start="403.199" data-end="404.849">hacked in his basement about two years</span> <span data-start="404.849" data-end="406.349">ago and haven't really bothered with</span> <span data-start="406.349" data-end="408.479">sins and that was the best thing I could</span> <span data-start="408.479" data-end="410.37">find to hook an xbox controller up to</span> <span data-start="410.37" data-end="413.639">the OS X so if you think of doing this</span> <span data-start="413.639" data-end="418.37">maybe windows this is the way to go</span> <span data-start="418.37" data-end="422.43">the support is about as good in Chrome</span> <span data-start="422.43" data-end="428.91">as it is in Firefox there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="428.91" data-end="430.47">different implications which will have a</span> <span data-start="430.47" data-end="434.04">look at in in a second on Linux there's</span> <span data-start="434.04" data-end="435.78">been some issues with buttons being</span> <span data-start="435.78" data-end="438.87">mapped wrong so you know you press a and</span> <span data-start="438.87" data-end="441.21">you get and y or your wiggle one</span> <span data-start="441.21" data-end="442.53">joystick and it registers and the other</span> <span data-start="442.53" data-end="448.29">one but yeah you best the best that is</span> <span data-start="448.29" data-end="454.71">windows with chrome or firefox so if you</span> <span data-start="454.71" data-end="457.14">go to step one here of getting the</span> <span data-start="457.14" data-end="461.4">connected gamepad like I said the</span> <span data-start="461.4" data-end="462.92">implementation is not locked down yet</span> <span data-start="462.92" data-end="465.87">the specs s that you need to expose to</span> <span data-start="465.87" data-end="469.02">events a connected event in a disconnect</span> <span data-start="469.02" data-end="471.9">event and this is how Firefox dusting</span> <span data-start="471.9" data-end="474.21">right it adds an event Lisa and license</span> <span data-start="474.21" data-end="477.54">to the Kinect event then you add a</span> <span data-start="477.54" data-end="480.51">handle to it and you get the gamepad</span> <span data-start="480.51" data-end="485.28">object off the event in chrome you have</span> <span data-start="485.28" data-end="486.81">to do it slightly differently in chrome</span> <span data-start="486.81" data-end="489.42">you have to ask a navigator object for</span> <span data-start="489.42" data-end="492.21">your game pads and then it'll be the</span> <span data-start="492.21" data-end="495.42">first game pad in that array hopefully</span> <span data-start="495.42" data-end="497.85">if you have more than one game pad</span> <span data-start="497.85" data-end="502.59">you'll have multiple game pats there the</span> <span data-start="502.59" data-end="505.86">second step is to start scheduling</span> <span data-start="505.86" data-end="509.01">polling for your gamepad so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="509.01" data-end="510.54">actually give you any vents when</span> <span data-start="510.54" data-end="512.58">anything's pressed right when you push a</span> <span data-start="512.58" data-end="514.77">button nothing really happens except</span> <span data-start="514.77" data-end="517.68">that the state changes the time step up</span> <span data-start="517.68" data-end="520.71">that time stamp updates but you have to</span> <span data-start="520.71" data-end="525.47">pull it and a good way of doing this is</span> <span data-start="525.47" data-end="529.44">requestanimationframe happily the same</span> <span data-start="529.44" data-end="531.18">browsers that support animation frames</span> <span data-start="531.18" data-end="533.19">are also supporting gamepad API so you</span> <span data-start="533.19" data-end="536.55">won't have any problems there and for</span> <span data-start="536.55" data-end="538.23">those who don't know what a animation</span> <span data-start="538.23" data-end="540.84">frame is it's basically their browser</span> <span data-start="540.84" data-end="543.24">running a loop for you and forcing that</span> <span data-start="543.24" data-end="546.66">loop when your tab loses focus which is</span> <span data-start="546.66" data-end="548.73">nice other ways you kind of chew through</span> <span data-start="548.73" data-end="552.329">battery like it's going out of fashion</span> <span data-start="552.339" data-end="555.799">slightly slightly different in chrome</span> <span data-start="555.799" data-end="561.709">and firefox here in chrome you just ask</span> <span data-start="561.709" data-end="564.349">the window for an animation frame and in</span> <span data-start="564.349" data-end="567.589">firefox it's a moss request guess they</span> <span data-start="567.589" data-end="576.699">want to be special so step three profit</span> <span data-start="576.699" data-end="580.339">this is where basically you check the</span> <span data-start="580.339" data-end="581.959">time stamping as a previous time step if</span> <span data-start="581.959" data-end="584.359">that time stamp has been updated that</span> <span data-start="584.359" data-end="586.399">means that the controller changed the</span> <span data-start="586.399" data-end="587.869">state has changed something has been</span> <span data-start="587.869" data-end="592.579">pushed and so yeah you can now do some</span> <span data-start="592.579" data-end="593.929">stuff whatever you want to do with those</span> <span data-start="593.929" data-end="604.249">events bit flaky so this isn't this</span> <span data-start="604.249" data-end="606.439">isn't just a gimmick though right this</span> <span data-start="606.439" data-end="608.239">isn't just something that were like muck</span> <span data-start="608.239"

<span data-start="741.99" data-end="745.2">actually quite easy to change I showed</span> <span data-start="745.2" data-end="746.43">you how to set up with the gamepad</span> <span data-start="746.43"

I'm really bad at</span> <span data-start="763.98" data-end="766.32">it first when I'm also talking we can</span> <span data-start="766.32" data-end="767.7">start playing game this is this is</span> <span data-start="767.7" data-end="769.77">actually just an open-source JavaScript</span> <span data-start="769.77" data-end="771.93">imitation Tetris and all I've done is</span> <span data-start="771.93" data-end="774.9">like tape get just it's exposed to the</span> <span data-start="774.9" data-end="777.15">events so it exposes the methods that</span> <span data-start="777.15" data-end="779.37">you need to call to you know move</span> <span data-start="779.37" data-end="783.03">something a turn something and so i just</span> <span data-start="783.03" data-end="785.88">added a little bit of gamepad api</span> <span data-start="785.88" data-end="789.27">goodness do this and i cannot start</span> <span data-start="789.27" data-end="792.36">playing this with one hand you couldn't</span> <span data-start="792.36" data-end="794.34">do that before this is Tetris it's got</span> <span data-start="794.34" data-end="799.05">all four controls right it's got right</span> <span data-start="799.05" data-end="803.7">left turn down and those four controls</span> <span data-start="803.7" data-end="805.8">you can find out with like a finger</span> <span data-start="805.8" data-end="809.54">missing even but they were mapped to</span> <span data-start="809.54" data-end="811.56">three keys on that side of the keyboard</span> <span data-start="811.56" data-end="813.95">and one key on that side of the keyboard</span> <span data-start="813.95" data-end="816.06">all right the other good thing about</span> <span data-start="816.06" data-end="817.13">this is they give</span> <span data-start="817.13" data-end="819.71">one hand need like Jesus if you have the</span> <span data-start="819.71" data-end="825.91">second hand and it's really quite</span> <span data-start="825.91" data-end="828.83">straightforward to to hook up to I've</span> <span data-start="828.83" data-end="829.73">done the same thing with the</span> <span data-start="829.73" data-end="831.2">presentation framework that I'm using</span> <span data-start="831.2" data-end="833.69">here using something called bespoke j/s</span> <span data-start="833.69" data-end="836.15">which spaces itself on on touch events</span> <span data-start="836.15" data-end="841.01">and key events and it's quite easy right</span> <span data-start="841.01" data-end="842.81">because again it exposes the methods</span> <span data-start="842.81" data-end="843.92">that you need to cause all you need to</span> <span data-start="843.92" data-end="846.89">do is like put some little gamepad API</span> <span data-start="846.89" data-end="849.71">script in there and call tetras right or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="849.71" data-end="854.6">Tetris left you know you might notice</span> <span data-start="854.6" data-end="856.04">that I'm using thresholds instead of</span> <span data-start="856.04" data-end="857.8">discrete values and that bit of co there</span> <span data-start="857.8" data-end="861.29">that's because the values you get from</span> <span data-start="861.29" data-end="865.39">these are sometimes a little bit dirty</span> <span data-start="865.39" data-end="868.73">so with the access for example it's a</span> <span data-start="868.73" data-end="870.32">floating point number when you get it</span> <span data-start="870.32" data-end="872.93">back and even if it's like completely</span> <span data-start="872.93" data-end="874.13">neutral like now I'm not touching</span> <span data-start="874.13" data-end="876.68">anything you'll still say that it's like</span> <span data-start="876.68" data-end="878.69">zero point zero zero one zero zero</span> <span data-start="878.69" data-end="881.3">because these things are still plastic</span> <span data-start="881.3" data-end="886.13">and not that precise but it's not just</span> <span data-start="886.13" data-end="890">about you know it's not just about games</span> <span data-start="890" data-end="892.97">and so just but presentation framework</span> <span data-start="892.97" data-end="895.82">game pads are part of something that we</span> <span data-start="895.82" data-end="899.09">can we can start thinking more about how</span> <span data-start="899.09" data-end="900.86">we let users interact with the things</span> <span data-start="900.86" data-end="903.32">that we built we're talking about these</span> <span data-start="903.32" data-end="904.85">things at the moment we're doing we're</span> <span data-start="904.85" data-end="907.04">doing responsive design right we know</span> <span data-start="907.04" data-end="909.02">that some devices are sure then some are</span> <span data-start="909.02" data-end="911.18">wide and some at all sometimes we have a</span> <span data-start="911.18" data-end="912.68">lot of screen space sometimes given</span> <span data-start="912.68" data-end="914.03">little so we gave responsive design</span> <span data-start="914.03" data-end="916.4">that's cool and we go progressive</span> <span data-start="916.4" data-end="918.26">enhancement because we know that some</span> <span data-start="918.26" data-end="920.03">browsers a and some rails are great</span> <span data-start="920.03" data-end="923.36">something some browsers have really</span> <span data-start="923.36" data-end="925.01">exciting features and some browsers</span> <span data-start="925.01" data-end="927.65">don't really have features and I think</span> <span data-start="927.65" data-end="928.85">this is one of those things that should</span> <span data-start="928.85" data-end="930.89">feed into that philosophy a little bit</span> <span data-start="930.89" data-end="932.27">right we need some sort of like</span> <span data-start="932.27" data-end="934.25">progressive enhancement for input</span> <span data-start="934.25" data-end="936.77">devices because it's really not that</span> <span data-start="936.77" data-end="943.16">hard to basically set up a PlayStation</span> <span data-start="943.16" data-end="948.44">drum pad hook it up it's a gamepad hook</span> <span data-start="948.44" data-end="950.15">it up to your browser</span> <span data-start="950.15" data-end="952.52">and then start playing the newspaper all</span> <span data-start="952.52" data-end="956.84">right go left article right article you</span> <span data-start="956.84" data-end="959.24">know use the pedal to scroll get a</span> <span data-start="959.24" data-end="962.18">workout with your breakfast or you know</span> <span data-start="962.18" data-end="963.92">allow people to remap there is some</span> <span data-start="963.92" data-end="965.57">single thing that they do every way they</span> <span data-start="965.57" data-end="969.53">interact with your silly little blog so</span> <span data-start="969.53" data-end="970.76">that they can use whatever input device</span> <span data-start="970.76" data-end="972.14">they want to we're going to get more of</span> <span data-start="972.14" data-end="974.42">this and I think it's going to be really</span> <span data-start="974.42" data-end="976.19">really exciting and I think you should</span> <span data-start="976.19" data-end="987.26">start playing with it today thank you</span> <span data-start="987.27" data-end="990.81">all right all right I think we can open</span> <span data-start="990.81" data-end="998.62">up for some questions okay Oh again</span> <span data-start="998.63" data-end="1000.65">you're gonna make me do

<span data-start="1006.71" data-end="1011.29">idea what the like handheld console</span> <span data-start="1011.29" data-end="1014.6">support is like for the gamepad API II</span> <span

data-end="1022.79">whether any way any of them have the</span> <span data-start="1022.79" data-end="1024.44">gamepad API and whether they may use</span> <span data-start="1024.44" data-end="1026.78">that kind of thing and or if it just</span> <span data-start="1026.78" data-end="1028.55">defaults to the mouse I'm assuming most</span> <span data-start="1028.55" data-end="1030.65">than the old ones to force the mouse but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1030.65" data-end="1031.82">I wonder if any of them actually support</span> <span data-start="1031.82" data-end="1033.31">the gamepad API in the first place</span> <span data-start="1033.31" data-end="1036.41">things like the des are natively built</span> <span data-start="1036.41" data-end="1038.39">to to work with the buttons that are</span> <span data-start="1038.39" data-end="1040.459">there I don't think they use the gamepad</span> <span data-start="1040.459" data-end="1043.22">API it's not ready yet I think they use</span> <span data-start="1043.22" data-end="1046.07">some sort of Shem that they already have</span> <span data-start="1046.07" data-end="1052.03">but I'm not sure all right next question</span> <span data-start="1052.03" data-end="1056.2">hi there as you're based in the UK um</span> <span data-start="1056.2" data-end="1060.88">over here hey hi and have you had any</span> <span data-start="1060.88"

data-end="1076.31">interested in maybe talking to them at</span> <span data-start="1076.31" data-end="1078.2">some point in the future I'm often gonna</span> <span data-start="1078.2" data-end="1080.9">be super cool to talk to them I hadn't</span> <span data-start="1080.9" data-end="1082.19">really thought about this until I found</span> <span data-start="1082.19"

data-end="1114.02">prancing through the audience well</span> <span data-start="1114.02" data-end="1115.79">there's just more about the movement of</span> <span data-start="1115.79" data-end="1117.92">these input devices because I don't</span> <span data-start="1117.92" data-end="1119.52">really see keyboards are much too</span> <span data-start="1119.52" data-end="1121.62">fenton game pets and I see the</span> <span data-start="1121.62" data-end="1125.1">tendencies are that the input devices</span> <span data-start="1125.1" data-end="1127.23">we're using now are more the input</span> <span data-start="1127.23" data-end="1129.6">devices we are born with with touch and</span> <span data-start="1129.6" data-end="1131.55">movement with the leap

be</span> <span data-start="1136.05" data-end="1139.38">like it may be interesting for gamers on</span> <span data-start="1139.38" data-end="1141.03">an xbox that they can navigate your blog</span> <span data-start="1141.03" data-end="1143.7">but for most people is it really useful</span> <span data-start="1143.7" data-end="1147.69">like and with the tendencies so I see</span> <span data-start="1147.69" data-end="1149.73">the gamepad API as it stands now it's</span> <span data-start="1149.73" data-end="1152.31">it's a beginning I think what we're</span> <span data-start="1152.31" data-end="1154.89">going to get is basically a future where</span> <span data-start="1154.89" data-end="1158.07">there are multiple manifold ways of</span> <span data-start="1158.07"
