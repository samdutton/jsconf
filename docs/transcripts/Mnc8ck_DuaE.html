data-end="297.94">am NOT an accessibility expert but you</span> <span data-start="297.94" data-end="299.53">don't need to be to do this kind of work</span> <span data-start="299.53"

three main</span> <span data-start="313.93" data-end="316.39">areas today first how do you know</span> <span data-start="316.39" data-end="317.59">whether or not your website is</span> <span

data-end="325.33">bugs how do you go about coding to fix</span> <span data-start="325.33" data-end="328.54">those bugs and then lastly how can you</span> <span data-start="328.54" data-end="330.49">adapt your process to prevent bugs like</span> <span data-start="330.49" data-end="333.51">that from happening in the first place</span> <span data-start="333.51" data-end="339.37">okay kicking things off with testing so</span> <span data-start="339.37" data-end="342">what is accessibility you mean at all</span> <span data-start="342" data-end="345.55">it's a very broadly scoped term but it</span> <span data-start="345.55" data-end="347.49">look luckily it is thoroughly documented</span> <span data-start="347.49" data-end="349.84">if you've ever had to

data-end="377.98">about accessibility some light reading</span> <span data-start="377.98" data-end="384.85">if you will what they distill are what</span> <span data-start="384.85" data-end="387.25">feature what makes features on the web</span> <span data-start="387.25" data-end="389.05">accessible or not accessible and they</span> <span data-start="389.05"

data-start="409.04" data-end="411.35">support them is infinitely broad and</span> <span data-start="411.35" data-end="413.99">while I'd love to cover everything we've</span> <span data-start="413.99" data-end="416.39">got like 20 minutes left so we're gonna</span> <span data-start="416.39" data-end="417.68">start with the hello world of</span> <span data-start="417.68" data-end="420.32">accessibility if you will so here are</span> <span data-start="420.32" data-end="422.54">some four areas that you can get started</span> <span data-start="422.54"

data-end="1233.169">a year ago when I joined there were 75</span> <span data-start="1233.169" data-end="1235.12">front-end engineers but there was only</span> <span data-start="1235.12" data-end="1238.72">one accessibility expert as I mentioned</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1238.72" data-end="1240.85">I am NOT that expert we have the famed</span> <span data-start="1240.85" data-end="1243.82">Todd Kurtz who is incredibly talented</span> <span data-start="1243.82" data-end="1244.99">and amazing to work with</span> <span data-start="1244.99" data-end="1248.02">but even so one engineer is not enough</span> <span data-start="1248.02" data-end="1249.549">to support all the accessibility</span> <span data-start="1249.549" data-end="1252.039">features we want to include so over the</span> <span data-start="1252.039" data-end="1253.48">past year we've rolled out training</span> <span data-start="1253.48" data-end="1255.07">similar to this one to ensure all</span> <span data-start="1255.07" data-end="1257.95">front-end engineers at slack understand</span> <span data-start="1257.95" data-end="1259.63">the accessibility criteria that we are</span> <span data-start="1259.63" data-end="1261.64">shooting for and how to build and test</span> <span data-start="1261.64" data-end="1264.52">for it more importantly that means that</span> <span data-start="1264.52" data-end="1266.62">since we all have this understanding</span> <span data-start="1266.62" data-end="1268.21">when we're reviewing each other's code</span> <span data-start="1268.21" data-end="1271.15">reviews and code and pull requests that</span> <span data-start="1271.15" data-end="1273.19">we know how to test accessibility for</span> <span data-start="1273.19" data-end="1276.429">everybody else those features too we've</span> <span data-start="1276.429" data-end="1278.83">taken it one step further and we also</span> <span data-start="1278.83" data-end="1280.84">ensure that our designers know what</span> <span data-start="1280.84" data-end="1283.39">accessibility is and isn't and they</span> <span data-start="1283.39" data-end="1284.83">provide things like the keyboard</span> <span data-start="1284.83" data-end="1286.99">interaction model for us so we can then</span> <span data-start="1286.99" data-end="1292">build it out we haven't are using our</span> <span data-start="1292" data-end="1293.559">internal design system has helped</span> <span data-start="1293.559" data-end="1296.02">formalize a lot of best practices so</span> <span data-start="1296.02" data-end="1297.58">over the last year we've also conducted</span> <span data-start="1297.58" data-end="1300.37">a color audit to simplify and ensure</span> <span data-start="1300.37" data-end="1304.72">that our smaller new set of colors meets</span> <span data-start="1304.72" data-end="1306.7">all of our contrast standards we've also</span> <span data-start="1306.7" data-end="1308.62">set up things like linters to prevent</span> <span data-start="1308.62" data-end="1311.409">folks from adding one-off colors this is</span> <span data-start="1311.409" data-end="1312.52">just one of the steps that we've taken</span> <span data-start="1312.52" data-end="1314.89">to help prepare for one of the most</span> <span data-start="1314.89" data-end="1317.169">requested features of slack dark mode so</span> <span data-start="1317.169" data-end="1319.15">that once it does roll out</span> <span data-start="1319.15" data-end="1320.74">we can ensure that it'll still be fully</span> <span data-start="1320.74" data-end="1325.51">accessible so having front Enders use a</span> <span data-start="1325.51" data-end="1327.49">centralized component library that is</span> <span data-start="1327.49" data-end="1331.15">accessible by default is awesome we</span> <span data-start="1331.15" data-end="1332.74">currently use these components and</span> <span data-start="1332.74" data-end="1335.47">nearly 75% of applicable areas of our</span> <span data-start="1335.47" data-end="1336.76">code base and we're trying to increase</span> <span data-start="1336.76" data-end="1339.97">that steadily but the single most useful</span> <span data-start="1339.97" data-end="1341.89">thing I've learned is that you need to</span> <span data-start="1341.89" data-end="1344.32">consider accessibility as early on in</span> <span data-start="1344.32" data-end="1347.26">the process as possible because it's</span> <span data-start="1347.26" data-end="1349.15">easier to add the blueberries in before</span> <span data-start="1349.15" data-end="1353.53">you bake muffin somebody once said we</span> <span data-start="1353.53" data-end="1356.679">also have a dedicated QA team to run</span> <span data-start="1356.679" data-end="1358.42">throw checks before we launch a feature</span> <span data-start="1358.42" data-end="1360.82">and also you to utilize a third-party</span> <span data-start="1360.82" data-end="1362.92">service called Ultra who conduct an</span> <span data-start="1362.92" data-end="1367.12">audit as well so even if you don't have</span> <span data-start="1367.12" data-end="1369.429">the benefit of a component library or</span> <span data-start="1369.429" data-end="1372.55">design system or QA team and you're so</span> <span data-start="1372.55"

you learning to become your own</span> <span data-start="1379.42" data-end="1383.62">resident expert awesome so nice job</span> <span data-start="1383.62" data-end="1386.17">everybody you've learned a
