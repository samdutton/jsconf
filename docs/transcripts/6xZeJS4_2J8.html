data-start="73.82" data-end="76.399">the original pebble in 2012 was a</span> <span data-start="76.399" data-end="78.649">started out as a Kickstarter project it</span> <span data-start="78.649" data-end="81.079">got a whole lot more interest than</span> <span data-start="81.079" data-end="83.27">anyone actually expected and at the time</span> <span data-start="83.27" data-end="85.64">it was

cooler but it looks</span> <span data-start="114.679" data-end="116.84">kind of awesome oh that guy i hope lots</span> <span data-start="116.84" data-end="117.889">of people are having fun with

<span data-start="122.63" data-end="124.46">then this year a few months ago we</span> <span data-start="124.46" data-end="126.799">released pebble released their newer</span> <span data-start="126.799" data-end="128.78">announced their new watch the pebble</span> <span data-start="128.78" data-end="131.33">time on kickstarter this is a revamp</span> <span data-start="131.33" data-end="134.18">design we've got a color display we've</span> <span data-start="134.18" data-end="135.77">also got added a microphone for voice</span> <span data-start="135.77" data-end="139.28">capabilities and this you know we did a</span> <span data-start="139.28" data-end="141.44">little bit better this time I hear we</span> <span data-start="141.44" data-end="142.91">gave Kickstarter a couple of bad days</span> <span data-start="142.91" data-end="145.05">sorry about that</span> <span data-start="145.05" data-end="147.73">but yeah so why would I want to pebble</span> <span data-start="147.73" data-end="149.41">for starters the thing that I like about</span> <span data-start="149.41" data-end="151.06">it best actually being kind of a</span> <span data-start="151.06" data-end="152.65">curmudgeon about technology is that it</span> <span data-start="152.65" data-end="155.02">is always accurate the time is synced</span> <span data-start="155.02" data-end="156.7">via its connection to your mobile device</span> <span data-start="156.7" data-end="158.65">so it's literally the most accurate</span> <span data-start="158.65" data-end="160.93">watch I've ever owned it's also got an</span> <span data-start="160.93" data-end="162.64">always-on screen which is what they</span> <span data-start="162.64" data-end="164.59">would call an e-paper display the idea</span> <span data-start="164.59" data-end="166.06">with this is that it reflects light</span> <span data-start="166.06" data-end="167.62">instead of emitting light so it's big</span> <span data-start="167.62" data-end="169.42">power savings and it's often times</span> <span data-start="169.42" data-end="171.76">easier to see in sunlight because of</span> <span data-start="171.76" data-end="173.26">this and other things you'll get up to a</span> <span data-start="173.26" data-end="174.79">week of battery life now that this is</span> <span data-start="174.79" data-end="176.77">dependent on how many active like button</span> <span data-start="176.77" data-end="177.94">pressing games you're playing on your</span> <span data-start="177.94" data-end="179.26">watch obviously but you'll get up to a</span> <span data-start="179.26" data-end="181.39">week of battery life and there are tons</span> <span data-start="181.39" data-end="182.92">of cool apps cool watch faces</span> <span data-start="182.92" data-end="184.66">integrations with companies all sorts of</span> <span data-start="184.66" data-end="189.4">stuff like this so what it isn't is you</span> <span data-start="189.4" data-end="191.11">know the pebble is a relatively simple</span> <span data-start="191.11" data-end="193.09">device it's not a heart or health</span> <span data-start="193.09" data-end="195.73">monitor it is not a payment system it is</span> <span data-start="195.73" data-end="198.49">not a smartphone on your wrist it is not</span> <span data-start="198.49" data-end="201.73">a new pile of virtual distractions or in</span> <span data-start="201.73" data-end="204.43">other words and overpriced trophy watch</span> <span data-start="204.43" data-end="210.16">was not on our to-do list so yeah along</span> <span data-start="210.16" data-end="211.75">with the pebble time we've come out with</span> <span data-start="211.75" data-end="214.6">a new idea for an operating system for</span> <span data-start="214.6" data-end="216.93">the watch this is the pebble timeline</span> <span data-start="216.93" data-end="219.43">the whole idea when you think about an</span> <span data-start="219.43" data-end="221.53">operating system what you want is to</span> <span data-start="221.53" data-end="222.91">have something where the information</span> <span data-start="222.91" data-end="224.05">that you really want the information</span> <span data-start="224.05" data-end="225.7">that you're really after is very readily</span> <span data-start="225.7" data-end="228.31">accessible for you and in the case of a</span> <span data-start="228.31" data-end="231.31">watch what you care about is time so</span> <span data-start="231.31" data-end="233.35">what this gives you is the the basic</span> <span data-start="233.35" data-end="235.51">like the the most basic service</span> <span data-start="235.51" data-end="237.16">interface for this operating system is</span> <span data-start="237.16" data-end="239.32">just the timeline you can hit one button</span> <span data-start="239.32" data-end="240.85">to get to your recent past and another</span> <span data-start="240.85" data-end="241.959">button to get to your recent future</span> <span data-start="241.959" data-end="246.04">upcoming events so yeah an interface for</span> <span data-start="246.04" data-end="247.75">upcoming and past life events it's</span> <span data-start="247.75" data-end="250.03">designed to be really simple and to save</span> <span data-start="250.03" data-end="251.739">you time as opposed to being another</span> <span data-start="251.739" data-end="252.85">thing that you're taking out of your</span> <span data-start="252.85" data-end="254.23">pocket to press buttons with and stuff</span> <span data-start="254.23" data-end="257.52">like that each event is called a pin it</span> <span data-start="257.52" data-end="260.35">can be easily created by our API is all</span> <span data-start="260.35" data-end="261.76">of these things are just JSON objects</span> <span data-start="261.76" data-end="264.46">and for starters without you having to</span> <span data-start="264.46" data-end="266.44">do anything your phone's calendar app is</span> <span data-start="266.44" data-end="269.76">automatically synced with your timeline</span> <span data-start="269.76" data-end="272.979">so what can I use it for we're sitting</span> <span data-start="272.979" data-end="274.84">here at a conference there's talks going</span> <span data-start="274.84" data-end="276.789">on all day left right and sideways let's</span> <span data-start="276.789" data-end="278.129">put the talk schedule</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="278.129" data-end="282.19">Lance yeah so let's let's try to do that</span> <span data-start="282.19" data-end="284.86">um so to get started with the timeline</span> <span data-start="284.86" data-end="288.039">API you have a couple things get a</span> <span data-start="288.039" data-end="291.129">script which is actually using a pebble</span> <span data-start="291.129" data-end="292.84">API to post pains this is just a nodejs</span> <span data-start="292.84" data-end="296.169">module you can grab off NPM and a small</span> <span data-start="296.169" data-end="297.849">watch app to handle the sinking of those</span> <span data-start="297.849" data-end="300.159">pins that's that's really it so let's</span> <span data-start="300.159" data-end="304.69">take a look at an example here is the no</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="304.69" data-end="307.75">Jess library peple API node and you can</span> <span data-start="307.75" data-end="310.06">create pins send a pin to a user pretty</span> <span data-start="310.06" data-end="312.25">straightforward so let's go look at an</span> <span data-start="312.25" data-end="314.11">example we get this J Escom 2015</span> <span data-start="314.11" data-end="316.09">schedule there's no read me because I</span> <span data-start="316.09" data-end="318.159">did this like 3am last night or</span> <span data-start="318.159" data-end="322.18">something but we got a year so you've</span> <span data-start="322.18" data-end="323.71">got to populate dodge yes this is the</span> <span data-start="323.71" data-end="325.18">bit that actually matters and it is very</span> <span data-start="325.18" data-end="328.36">quick to put together and hurry you've</span> <span data-start="328.36" data-end="330.55">got all sorts of stuff here at the top</span> <span data-start="330.55" data-end="333.099">which I'll show you this is to get the</span> <span data-start="333.099" data-end="334.93">schedule it's just parses the GS comp</span> <span data-start="334.93" data-end="336.58">schedule web page and pulls out all of</span> <span data-start="336.58" data-end="339.909">the data and whatnot kind of rage roots</span> <span data-start="339.909" data-end="342.669">and regex here but it does the job lance</span> <span data-start="342.669" data-end="344.919">has that habit sometimes it's true but</span> <span data-start="344.919" data-end="346.719">so if you need to make a quick j/s comp</span> <span data-start="346.719" data-end="348.4">app you can come steal this function and</span> <span data-start="348.4" data-end="350.289">it does the right thing at least as long</span> <span data-start="350.289" data-end="351.52">as this change format doesn't change</span> <span data-start="351.52" data-end="353.259">around but any of it so we skipped down</span> <span data-start="353.259" data-end="354.729">to the part that it's actually really</span> <span data-start="354.729" data-end="357.43">relevant here to get scheduled magic it</span> <span data-start="357.43" data-end="358.75">all to worry about alright we've got a</span> <span data-start="358.75" data-end="361.81">schedule we come down here for each and</span> <span data-start="361.81" data-end="364.719">we just have pins you create a pin you</span> <span data-start="364.719" data-end="368.199">have a topic you have a generic pan</span> <span data-start="368.199" data-end="370.389">layout to notification it's got a title</span> <span data-start="370.389" data-end="372.88">that's all you need then you send the</span> <span data-start="372.88" data-end="374.949">shared pin to the j s compu doesn't 15</span> <span data-start="374.949" data-end="378.729">schedule topic and you can log it if you</span> <span data-start="378.729" data-end="381.13">want that's it that's all it takes to</span> <span data-start="381.13" data-end="382.21">make a basic out the nice thing about</span> <span data-start="382.21" data-end="383.77">this is that there's no server involved</span> <span data-start="383.77" data-end="386.469">here you just run this once Oh or run it</span> <span data-start="386.469" data-end="388.36">periodically if you want to update so</span> <span data-start="388.36" data-end="389.65">that's your data source up doing the</span> <span data-start="389.65" data-end="391.659">pins those pans are then posted to our</span> <span data-start="391.659" data-end="394">server and the watches then pull those</span> <span data-start="394" data-end="396.009">pins from our servers and keep in sync</span> <span data-start="396.009" data-end="403.609">for you so let's jump back</span> <span data-start="403.619" data-end="405.779">there's actually what that looks like</span> <span data-start="405.779" data-end="408.339">got a couple things in the timeline</span> <span data-start="408.339" data-end="411.009">there to show what the next things are</span> <span data-start="411.009" data-end="413.019">to do so what I looked at to realize oh</span> <span data-start="413.019" data-end="414.159">hey we have a talk that we're supposed</span> <span data-start="414.159" data-end="417.849">to be at so we did make it here yeah</span> <span data-start="417.849" data-end="421.869">thnkx Bibble yeah so very basic we</span> <span data-start="421.869" data-end="424.179">provide an API we have the no Jess</span> <span data-start="424.179" data-end="426.339">library you make content and then you</span> <span data-start="426.339" data-end="429.039">make apps that you know make the watch</span> <span data-start="429.039" data-end="430.269">gets notified when that content has</span> <span data-start="430.269" data-end="433.449">changed so pretty straightforward here</span> <span data-start="433.449" data-end="435.399">you can actually create update delete</span> <span data-start="435.399" data-end="437.649">pins pins are attached to either topics</span> <span data-start="437.649" data-end="439.239">or users so you can either attach a pen</span> <span data-start="439.239" data-end="441.039">directly to a user and that goes to only</span> <span data-start="441.039" data-end="443.229">their timeline or to a topic which goes</span> <span data-start="443.229" data-end="445.36">to many users apps subscribe to the</span> <span data-start="445.36" data-end="448.599">topics the watch passively updates that</span> <span data-start="448.599" data-end="451.029">and you can notify the user if it's</span> <span data-start="451.029" data-end="452.499">something that matters right now you</span> <span data-start="452.499" data-end="454.029">give them a notification else with</span> <span data-start="454.029" data-end="456.809">something they can just passively check</span> <span data-start="456.809" data-end="459.249">all right so let's let's go over some of</span> <span data-start="459.249" data-end="461.229">the tools we've used here it's all</span> <span data-start="461.229" data-end="463.779">pretty standard stuff we use MongoDB is</span> <span data-start="463.779" data-end="466.689">our primary data store it's all built-in</span> <span data-start="466.689" data-end="468.579">nodejs & Co ajs as far as our</span> <span data-start="468.579" data-end="471.369">application runtimes concerned we've got</span> <span data-start="471.369" data-end="474.069">red is in place as a cache and to handle</span> <span data-start="474.069" data-end="476.409">rate limiting for the timeline api's and</span> <span data-start="476.409" data-end="478.689">the actual notifications are handled by</span> <span data-start="478.689" data-end="480.249">a pool of workers which are pulling</span> <span data-start="480.249" data-end="482.919">messages off of amazon SQS no real</span> <span data-start="482.919" data-end="484.329">rocket science here just good solid</span> <span data-start="484.329" data-end="487.179">stuff so let's talk about our web</span> <span data-start="487.179" data-end="488.379">infrastructure let's talk about how</span> <span data-start="488.379" data-end="489.909">we've actually built and deployed this</span> <span data-start="489.909" data-end="493.089">whole thing so the the philosophy that</span> <span data-start="493.089" data-end="495.579">we have is best summed up as version</span> <span data-start="495.579" data-end="498.399">control the immutable deployments now</span> <span data-start="498.399" data-end="500.319">what this means is the idea that if</span> <span data-start="500.319" data-end="501.729">you're making a change to your</span> <span data-start="501.729" data-end="504.219">infrastructure that is actually even</span> <span data-start="504.219" data-end="505.419">more something that you should be</span> <span data-start="505.419" data-end="507.009">tracking in version control compared to</span> <span data-start="507.009" data-end="509.559">your coat the idea is that if you're</span> <span data-start="509.559" data-end="511.539">making a change it's getting tracked an</span> <span data-start="511.539" data-end="512.919">immutable deployment is the idea

yourself out of the box docker</span> <span data-start="741.62" data-end="744.35">only knows how to pull standard IO out</span> <span data-start="744.35" data-end="745.91">of these processes and it
