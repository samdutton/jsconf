data-start="869.68" data-end="871.48">always trying to make sense of the world</span> <span data-start="871.48" data-end="873.82">around us and for example way when you</span> <span data-start="873.82" data-end="876.31">get more and more dots which are totally</span> <span data-start="876.31" data-end="880.42">random for example here you don't know</span> <span data-start="880.42" data-end="882.279">that a lot of people do not see random</span> <span data-start="882.279" data-end="884.94">dots but they start seeing poodles right</span> <span data-start="884.94" data-end="888.279">or you've seen people looking at the</span> <span data-start="888.279" data-end="890.86">cloud and seeing are no monsters bears</span> <span data-start="890.86" data-end="894.25">or people looking at it already drunken</span> <span data-start="894.25" data-end="896.829">coffee coffee cups and trying to predict</span> <span data-start="896.829" data-end="902.14">the future it's our way of telling it's</span> <span data-start="902.14" data-end="905.709">our way of that our brain tells us oh</span> <span data-start="905.709" data-end="908.079">it's so too</span> <span data-start="908.079" data-end="910.51">too complicated I want to make it simple</span> <span data-start="910.51" data-end="915.31">again and here is an example where it</span> <span data-start="915.31" data-end="918.76">could be a problem in programming let's</span> <span data-start="918.76" data-end="922.3">say we have this these are a lot of you</span> <span data-start="922.3" data-end="927.19">a lot of even our statements right so if</span> <span data-start="927.19" data-end="930.579">if a person is reading it after probably</span> <span data-start="930.579" data-end="932.769">the second or the third they will get</span> <span data-start="932.769" data-end="933.88">the general pattern</span> <span data-start="933.88" data-end="936.73">oh we're just checking about type right</span> <span data-start="936.73" data-end="940.18">and then something happens for for a</span> <span data-start="940.18" data-end="943.36">specific type but there is a great</span> <span data-start="943.36" data-end="946.57">chance they will not see that we</span> <span data-start="946.57" data-end="950.12">actually broke the pattern in few places</span> <span data-start="950.12" data-end="952.86">so with this it is really important to</span> <span data-start="952.86" data-end="955.56">have our patterns in um in in in a much</span> <span data-start="955.56" data-end="958.29">simpler ways like for example if this</span> <span data-start="958.29" data-end="962.52">was in an object we couldn't he wouldn't</span> <span data-start="962.52" data-end="966.57">be so easy for us for us to break the</span> <span data-start="966.57" data-end="974.7">pattern the next trick is to is to put</span> <span data-start="974.7" data-end="978.21">more focus on on on reaction we are</span> <span data-start="978.21" data-end="981.27">doing and not so much on the intricacies</span> <span data-start="981.27" data-end="986.64">of the logic here is an example here is</span> <span data-start="986.64" data-end="991.41">the logic of a kid in us in the ass</span> <span data-start="991.41"

if it's not a weekday but if it's</span> <span data-start="999.45" data-end="1002.12">a Saturday it plays it plays football</span> <span data-start="1002.12" data-end="1004.64">and if it's raining it watches TV</span> <span data-start="1004.64" data-end="1007.61">because they can play food football and</span> <span data-start="1007.61" data-end="1010.4">on Sunday obviously kids have to do</span> <span data-start="1010.4" data-end="1012.98">their homework some some times and if</span> <span data-start="1012.98" data-end="1015.11">it's winter we like like birds really</span> <span data-start="1015.11" data-end="1020.72">like to hibernate so how how can we make</span> <span data-start="1020.72" data-end="1024.29">this simpler because when you look at it</span> <span data-start="1024.29" data-end="1027.41">you don't see any any actual pattern it</span> <span data-start="1027.41" data-end="1029.66">is just a random logic going back and</span> <span data-start="1029.66" data-end="1033.59">back and forth and here is what we can</span> <span data-start="1033.59" data-end="1035.63">do we can just focus on the action</span> <span data-start="1035.63"
