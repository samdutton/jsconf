<p><span data-start="85.82" data-end="87.59">JavaScript code again and want to</span> <span data-start="87.59" data-end="89.99">present a chase come for you so it was</span> <span data-start="89.99" data-end="92.45">like yeah my talk got accepted so ask</span> <span data-start="92.45" data-end="95.06">you and then actually well now that</span> <span data-start="95.06" data-end="96.89">means I got to get is working so that</span> <span data-start="96.89" data-end="99.77">was the hard part but let's give a demo</span> <span data-start="99.77" data-end="104.899">so this is what this is jay Furyk github</span> <span data-start="104.899" data-end="108.109">I Oh Rach xjs you want to try it out so</span> <span data-start="108.109" data-end="111.14">what we can do in the console is you</span> <span data-start="111.14" data-end="115.609">know not only would do just new records</span> <span data-start="115.609" data-end="119.78">a B then you would do regular expression</span> <span data-start="119.78" data-end="122.6">execute foo AV and get something back</span> <span data-start="122.6" data-end="126.88">and now what you can do do same thing</span> <span data-start="126.88" data-end="131.46">just with the javascript implementation</span> <span data-start="131.47" data-end="135.98">you so that works but what's cooler is</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="138.62">am the debugger parts so here you can</span> <span data-start="138.62" data-end="141.89">write your regular expression and you</span> <span data-start="141.89" data-end="143.24">basically have some input and you see</span> <span data-start="143.24" data-end="145.819">what matches so here you see what</span> <span data-start="145.819" data-end="148.16">happens so at the top it it looks at a</span> <span data-start="148.16" data-end="151.19">and B then tries to match a but that</span> <span data-start="151.19" data-end="152.96">doesn't work because it's be so it goes</span> <span data-start="152.96" data-end="155.96">back then it matches be and yeah that's</span> <span data-start="155.96" data-end="158.09">successful that's pretty cool so</span> <span data-start="158.09" data-end="160.64">try something more complex you see yeah</span> <span data-start="160.64" data-end="162.349">that's that's not regular X so let's</span> <span data-start="162.349" data-end="164.51">write a litte bit more cool thing is</span> <span data-start="164.51" data-end="165.92">once you implement the regular</span> <span data-start="165.92" data-end="168.11">expressions you are pretty good at</span> <span data-start="168.11" data-end="171.95">writing them it turns out so it's like</span> <span data-start="171.95" data-end="178.7">this and now we can do hello and you see</span> <span data-start="178.7" data-end="181.819">matches in real yr there's a little bit</span> <span data-start="181.819" data-end="184.7">to learn something so this is now what</span> <span data-start="184.7" data-end="187.31">happens is like it tries to you know</span> <span data-start="187.31" data-end="190.64">repeat this a few times so it matches aw</span> <span data-start="190.64" data-end="193.13">machines the chapter it matches they</span> <span data-start="193.13" data-end="195.62">tries next time and like are the column</span> <span data-start="195.62" data-end="198.26">doesn't work so does back-trace now calm</span> <span data-start="198.26" data-end="201.26">words it tries to match multiple em</span> <span data-start="201.26" data-end="203.989">spaces so another space no no that's not</span> <span data-start="203.989" data-end="206.42">a space anymore so got to backtrack okay</span> <span data-start="206.42" data-end="208.299">now repeat the W yeah that's the word</span> <span data-start="208.299" data-end="210.53">there's nothing else but yeah I'm all</span> <span data-start="210.53" data-end="213.379">right on so that's it and what you also</span> <span data-start="213.379" data-end="215.239">get is you get the results of your</span> <span data-start="215.239" data-end="217.67">matches so you see the a and B are in</span> <span data-start="217.67" data-end="219.769">groups you can share this to your</span> <span data-start="219.769" data-end="221.54">friends so if they come along oh this is</span> <span data-start="221.54" data-end="222.859">not matching you can fix it and give</span> <span data-start="222.859" data-end="224.69">them the link again so it's basic just</span> <span data-start="224.69" data-end="226.489">putting this in the hash you breathe on</span> <span data-start="226.489" data-end="228.98">school and you also get a parse tree for</span> <span data-start="228.98" data-end="230.75">basically the door directly expression</span> <span data-start="230.75" data-end="232.7">there right up here so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="232.7" data-end="238.579">cool so let's see how this works so this</span> <span data-start="238.579" data-end="240.319">is like an overview of what I'm going to</span> <span data-start="240.319" data-end="242.599">talk about so basically you're going to</span> <span data-start="242.599" data-end="244.459">tell you a little bit how the past trees</span> <span data-start="244.459" data-end="246.919">build how to internal node list works</span> <span data-start="246.919" data-end="248.93">which is basically what amateur uses</span> <span data-start="248.93" data-end="250.97">them to really go with string and see</span> <span data-start="250.97" data-end="254.15">whether it matches on art and then about</span> <span data-start="254.15" data-end="257.18">how to regular expression reg ex object</span> <span data-start="257.18" data-end="259.82">itself a few things about it and then</span> <span data-start="259.82" data-end="261.769">writing the chit and some conclusion</span> <span data-start="261.769" data-end="267.169">stuff so let's talk about past 3am the</span> <span data-start="267.169" data-end="269.419">parse tree basically in computer science</span> <span data-start="269.419" data-end="271.729">means that if you have some string you</span> <span data-start="271.729" data-end="273.169">give some rip em structured</span> <span data-start="273.169" data-end="275.93">representation of that string and that</span> <span data-start="275.93" data-end="278.36">structures described by a crammer rules</span> <span data-start="278.36" data-end="280.7">in a high-level what we want to achieve</span> <span data-start="280.7" data-end="283.07">is we have records that we put in we</span> <span data-start="283.07" data-end="285.289">have a parser and it generates the</span> <span data-start="285.289" data-end="288.11">posturing so let's take a look at an</span> <span data-start="288.11" data-end="289.88">example so here we have this expression</span> <span data-start="289.88" data-end="291.31">where you have</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.31" data-end="293.65">OOP and then inside you have a B or C</span> <span data-start="293.65" data-end="297.58">and if we will the past 3-4 this this</span> <span data-start="297.58" data-end="299.92">looks likely so at the top we have group</span> <span data-start="299.92" data-end="302.2">then we have this Junction because we</span> <span data-start="302.2" data-end="304.9">have I a B or C then we have an</span> <span data-start="304.9" data-end="306.64">alternative that means the can be</span> <span data-start="306.64" data-end="308.8">multiple things following each other and</span> <span data-start="308.8" data-end="310.45">then we have the character a and</span> <span data-start="310.45" data-end="315.4">character p and as a set a B or C so we</span> <span data-start="315.4" data-end="318.55">have the sea on the other side so this</span> <span data-start="318.55" data-end="322.48">is what a parse tree looks like am the</span> <span data-start="322.48" data-end="325.09">part of that I'd wrote it's completely</span> <span data-start="325.09" data-end="328.18">handwritten I took a computer science</span> <span data-start="328.18" data-end="330.13">class on compilers and that we used a</span> <span data-start="330.13" data-end="333.01">generator and I was I'm still young so I</span> <span data-start="333.01" data-end="334.57">thought well now write one my own my own</span> <span data-start="334.57" data-end="336.64">and call a bit painful but you're gonna</span> <span data-start="336.64" data-end="339.85">see there's only basic error handling</span> <span data-start="339.85" data-end="342.61">which could be improved and the thing is</span> <span data-start="342.61" data-end="345.04">that it uses regular expressions itself</span> <span data-start="345.04" data-end="346.72">so it's kind of cheating that you write</span> <span data-start="346.72" data-end="348.46">your regular expression parser for</span> <span data-start="348.46" data-end="349.99">transcript which uses regular</span> <span data-start="349.99" data-end="351.67">expressions from JavaScript again and</span> <span data-start="351.67" data-end="355.47">but i hope i can just replace them with</span> <span data-start="355.47" data-end="359.29">tractor off or compile my my own thing</span> <span data-start="359.29" data-end="361">to a transcript function and use it</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="364.81">there em but what I also try to do is</span> <span data-start="364.81" data-end="367.42">for the past three that it emits that to</span> <span data-start="367.42" data-end="369.91">contain useful information so for</span> <span data-start="369.91" data-end="372.13">example if you have a regular expression</span> <span data-start="372.13" data-end="375.1">like a bee or troop and they basically</span> <span data-start="375.1" data-end="377.71">give back reference it's not obvious</span> <span data-start="377.71" data-end="381.46">that / one means it is a reference for</span> <span data-start="381.46" data-end="383.02">example if you would have a slash to</span> <span data-start="383.02" data-end="385.18">there would not be such a group and you</span> <span data-start="385.18" data-end="386.83">need to figure out what to do and the</span> <span data-start="386.83" data-end="388.99">parts are already says the kid type is</span> <span data-start="388.99" data-end="390.73">referenced so it's really reference and</span> <span data-start="390.73" data-end="393.28">its reference group not one and you also</span> <span data-start="393.28" data-end="395.65">got it from to that means where the</span> <span data-start="395.65" data-end="397.54">characters starting and ending and it</span> <span data-start="397.54" data-end="398.89">got this raw string which basically</span> <span data-start="398.89" data-end="400.96">means okay this is part of pass three is</span> <span data-start="400.96" data-end="405.13">this backslash one ok so now</span> <span data-start="405.13" data-end="407.2">implementing the parcel was kind of fun</span> <span data-start="407.2" data-end="409.06">because this is like the official</span> <span data-start="409.06" data-end="411.07">grammar from the echamos back so try to</span> <span data-start="411.07" data-end="412.84">follow this back so this is where it</span> <span data-start="412.84" data-end="416.2">starts wait continues a little bit more</span> <span data-start="416.2" data-end="419.2">and this is the final end so took me a</span> <span data-start="419.2" data-end="421.96">little bit long to implement this but</span> <span data-start="421.96" data-end="424.66">yet it's pretty working now um</span> <span data-start="424.66" data-end="426.97">these are actually just the grammar</span> <span data-start="426.97" data-end="429.25">rules for character classes it was a</span> <span data-start="429.25" data-end="431.08">blog post complaining the directly</span> <span data-start="431.08" data-end="435.46">expression grammar is so horrible it</span> <span data-start="435.46" data-end="437.71">turns out that it got to be that like</span> <span data-start="437.71" data-end="440.53">that way for this reason and for example</span> <span data-start="440.53" data-end="443.71">if you have a regular expression where</span> <span data-start="443.71" data-end="446.56">you have just a character arrange a ana</span> <span data-start="446.56" data-end="449.29">minors that's an actual interpreted as</span> <span data-start="449.29" data-end="452.95">you I've imagined a or minors so if you</span> <span data-start="452.95" data-end="455.11">execute it against a minus sign that</span> <span data-start="455.11" data-end="457.23">that actually results in something</span> <span data-start="457.23" data-end="460.9">whereas if you have a minus B and you</span> <span data-start="460.9" data-end="463.12">execute it against just a minus sign</span> <span data-start="463.12" data-end="465.43">that doesn't match because it really</span> <span data-start="465.43" data-end="467.14">means the ranges of characters between a</span> <span data-start="467.14" data-end="472.39">and B and but so you you see you need to</span> <span data-start="472.39" data-end="474.37">keep some kind of track or state whether</span> <span data-start="474.37" data-end="476.53">you have a minus and something following</span> <span data-start="476.53" data-end="478.36">or you have a minus and actually</span> <span data-start="478.36" data-end="480.25">character following but we have a</span> <span data-start="480.25" data-end="482.59">context-free grammar here so there's no</span> <span data-start="482.59" data-end="485.11">real way to encode a state and their own</span> <span data-start="485.11" data-end="486.79">way to encode estate is to have more</span> <span data-start="486.79" data-end="488.98">grammar rules and that's why disposed up</span> <span data-start="488.98" data-end="493.39">such horrible a lot um someone's on a</span> <span data-start="493.39" data-end="496.36">passer so um I think looking back I</span> <span data-start="496.36" data-end="497.86">might should have used the parser</span> <span data-start="497.86" data-end="500.53">generator which would have made more</span> <span data-start="500.53" data-end="502.9">errors and more bear error messages and</span> <span data-start="502.9" data-end="506.5">also helped me too yep tube to choose</span> <span data-start="506.5" data-end="510.34">right mmm easily I try to read follow</span> <span data-start="510.34" data-end="512.41">this back as close as possible but their</span> <span data-start="512.41" data-end="514.69">thumbs things they're not in the specs</span> <span data-start="514.69" data-end="517.51">for example or I'm a transcript engine</span> <span data-start="517.51" data-end="519.4">directly expression down there which is</span> <span data-start="519.4" data-end="521.11">the closing brackets it's valid where's</span> <span data-start="521.11" data-end="523.99">there's no such rule in the grammar and</span> <span data-start="523.99" data-end="527.97">passing numbers is pretty interesting um</span> <span data-start="527.97" data-end="531.52">so this is in the parts that smell</span> <span data-start="531.52" data-end="533.71">expression so as I already said if you</span> <span data-start="533.71" data-end="536.26">have like two truths any of them as / to</span> <span data-start="536.26" data-end="539.2">that meetings a reference for sure but</span> <span data-start="539.2" data-end="541.21">what if you have number that's not a</span> <span data-start="541.21" data-end="544.24">reference and so actually turns out if</span> <span data-start="544.24" data-end="546.28">it's an actual number you got to</span> <span data-start="546.28" data-end="549.52">interpret this like you got to do ya get</span> <span data-start="549.52" data-end="551.35">an actual number and then use a string</span> <span data-start="551.35" data-end="553.36">character off to represent what</span> <span data-start="553.36" data-end="555.73">characters should match against if it's</span> <span data-start="555.73" data-end="557.85">not an octal number</span> <span data-start="557.85" data-end="559.17">just interpret the number basically</span> <span data-start="559.17" data-end="562.44">without a backslash but at least in v8 a</span> <span data-start="562.44" data-end="564.12">spider monkey does something different</span> <span data-start="564.12" data-end="566.459">it was took me some hours to get these</span> <span data-start="566.459" data-end="569.94">small details right but it's now passing</span> <span data-start="569.94" data-end="573.75">all the tests okay so now that we have</span> <span data-start="573.75" data-end="576.6">to parse tree and we're looking at the</span> <span data-start="576.6" data-end="578.25">node list which is basically you think</span> <span data-start="578.25" data-end="580.47">that match uses to execute against</span> <span data-start="580.47" data-end="583.079">regular expression and so we convert</span> <span data-start="583.079" data-end="585.54">parse tree to note list and stave</span> <span data-start="585.54" data-end="587.639">structure for the matter so simple</span> <span data-start="587.639" data-end="590.1">example is if you have red X a and B</span> <span data-start="590.1" data-end="593.49">this looks like maybe you have a node of</span> <span data-start="593.49" data-end="597.06">type care character with data a

data-end="824.17">eight</span> <span data-start="824.17" data-end="826.47">that looks good so moves to next one and</span> <span data-start="826.47" data-end="828.94">now it has the option either to match B</span> <span data-start="828.94" data-end="832.54">or C so it chooses ok I choose the first</span> <span data-start="832.54" data-end="835.18">one and before it goes into dirt makes a</span>

data-start="841.329" data-end="844.41">test be yep that's good so we move to d</span> <span data-start="844.41" data-end="847.839">which st up the works basically we ran</span> <span data-start="847.839" data-end="851.68">the file so we are done so if that</span> <span data-start="851.68" data-end="853.87">doesn't work because you know the first</span> <span data-start="853.87" data-end="856.149">option is not working and it looks like</span> <span data-start="856.149" data-end="860.76">this so we have the same thing again we</span> <span data-start="860.76" data-end="864.85">come here we try to match be and we</span> <span data-start="864.85" data-end="866.589">cloned this but actually this time it</span> <span data-start="866.589" data-end="867.85">doesn't work because we have to see at</span> <span data-start="867.85" data-end="869.5">that position so what we do we do</span> <span data-start="869.5" data-end="871.75">backtracking and so we jump out the</span> <span data-start="871.75" data-end="875.579">function we try to match see this time</span> <span data-start="875.579" data-end="878.62">with another so it is also another clone</span> <span data-start="878.62" data-end="883.87">state as double Prime we try to match ok</span> <span data-start="883.87"

data-end="892.54">against that thing it does we try that</span> <span data-start="892.54" data-end="898.35">works and we are done again ok um and</span> <span data-start="898.35" data-end="900.61">while we're doing this we are also</span> <span data-start="900.61" data-end="902.56">recording this trace information that's</span> <span data-start="902.56"

due back dragging in what part is</span> <span data-start="908.29" data-end="911.709">matching and there are some pitfalls if</span> <span data-start="911.709" data-end="913.69">you implement this matter so one thing</span> <span data-start="913.69" data-end="917.769">that came across is basically if you if</span> <span data-start="917.769" data-end="919.75">you have a loop when you go back and you</span> <span data-start="919.75" data-end="922.089">get to reset all the mattress that you</span> <span data-start="922.089" data-end="925.66">did before so example and the the crew p</span> <span data-start="925.66" data-end="930.43">if you loop the outer ABC once more you</span> <span data-start="930.43" data-end="934.12">got to reset the inner group for be ok</span> <span data-start="934.12" data-end="936.339">that's that someone were the inspectors</span> <span data-start="936.339" data-end="938.38">but you also need to reset the count of</span> <span data-start="938.38" data-end="940.66">four to be so there was back there</span> <span data-start="940.66" data-end="943.329">basically of the first time ABC matches</span> <span data-start="943.329" data-end="946.029">it would still not reset the counter for</span> <span data-start="946.029" data-end="948.43">this be in a group and then just tries</span> <span data-start="948.43" data-end="951.22">to con new matching a and plus one piece</span> <span data-start="951.22" data-end="953.829">next time which didn't work also you</span> <span data-start="953.829" data-end="955.959">have two problems with infinity loops so</span> <span data-start="955.959" data-end="957.51">for example the expression</span> <span data-start="957.51" data-end="959.55">they're busy you could say while it's</span> <span data-start="959.55" data-end="962.31">just trying to match as many times an</span> <span data-start="962.31" data-end="964.62">empty string which is basically infinity</span> <span data-start="964.62" data-end="969.63">match but yeah the all the ancients just</span> <span data-start="969.63" data-end="972.57">match the a and directly so you need to</span> <span data-start="972.57" data-end="973.92">have some loop protection which you can</span> <span data-start="973.92" data-end="976.56">do pretty easily by just saying well if</span> <span data-start="976.56" data-end="979.05">you came and come here once more in this</span> <span data-start="979.05" data-end="980.91">kind of loop or this repetition and</span> <span data-start="980.91" data-end="982.8">there was no process you say okay then I</span> <span data-start="982.8" data-end="984.93">just do the other way and don't go into</span> <span data-start="984.93" data-end="989.73">group anymore okay so now we have we</span> <span data-start="989.73" data-end="991.59">have liked you can pass in a regular</span> <span data-start="991.59" data-end="993.81">expression and then you basically can</span> <span data-start="993.81" data-end="995.67">build the past three we have to make</span> <span data-start="995.67" data-end="998.1">sure but what you want to use expose</span> <span data-start="998.1" data-end="1000.11">some object that looks like the building</span> <span data-start="1000.11" data-end="1001.67">regular expression to the user that you</span> <span data-start="1001.67" data-end="1003.53">can play with it so it's about building</span> <span data-start="1003.53" data-end="1006.35">the records J as object that you've seen</span> <span data-start="1006.35" data-end="1009.38">before so it has just these two</span> <span data-start="1009.38" data-end="1011.42">functions execute and test you could</span> <span data-start="1011.42" data-end="1013.69">also think about string prototype em</span> <span data-start="1013.69" data-end="1017">match etc but I said that's out of scope</span> <span data-start="1017" data-end="1018.65">of this project so just concentrate on</span> <span data-start="1018.65" data-end="1021.44">these two functions and that's</span> <span data-start="1021.44" data-end="1026.02">repetition where we already did em and</span> <span data-start="1026.02" data-end="1028.4">maybe it's you know the first attempt</span> <span data-start="1028.4" data-end="1030.89">will be that it's I mean that looks</span> <span data-start="1030.89" data-end="1033.589">pretty simple to rewrite just if you</span> <span data-start="1033.589" data-end="1035.69">have something like execute it just take</span> <span data-start="1035.69" data-end="1038.51">the regular expressions thing and you</span> <span data-start="1038.51" data-end="1041.12">parse it you build a note list and then</span> <span data-start="1041.12" data-end="1043.1">you just throw that a matter and see</span> <span data-start="1043.1" data-end="1045.589">what comes back but it turns out that's</span> <span data-start="1045.589" data-end="1047.6">not want to send the right thing to do</span> <span data-start="1047.6" data-end="1050.93">and because down there as you see the</span> <span data-start="1050.93" data-end="1052.31">first regular expression works fine</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1052.31" data-end="1054.74">Boston butter the last one doesn't and</span> <span data-start="1054.74" data-end="1058.61">the reason is the ABC can match at an</span> <span data-start="1058.61" data-end="1060.38">arbitrary position so it doesn't have to</span> <span data-start="1060.38" data-end="1062.48">measure the first one but the first</span> <span data-start="1062.48" data-end="1064.67">implementation just didn't you know</span> <span data-start="1064.67" data-end="1067.28">looked at anything with a certain offset</span> <span data-start="1067.28" data-end="1069.71">from the beginning so how could that be</span> <span data-start="1069.71" data-end="1073.28">fixed so the easy fix is to do some kind</span> <span data-start="1073.28" data-end="1077.06">of fake loop and so if we have ABC you</span> <span data-start="1077.06" data-end="1078.71">just could convert that regular</span> <span data-start="1078.71" data-end="1081.2">expression to basically say well try to</span> <span data-start="1081.2" data-end="1085.61">match as as less possible any characters</span> <span data-start="1085.61" data-end="1088.34">and then the ABC following and also Duke</span> <span data-start="1088.34" data-end="1090.559">roofing around such that you recall</span> <span data-start="1090.559" data-end="1093.919">where we actually did a match turns out</span> <span data-start="1093.919" data-end="1098.779">the worse so where's the problem is you</span> <span data-start="1098.779" data-end="1100.789">end up with a lot of recursion in this</span> <span data-start="1100.789" data-end="1103.009">case because every time you do this kind</span> <span data-start="1103.009" data-end="1105.32">of match something at the beginning this</span> <span data-start="1105.32" data-end="1107.509">means another function call the way the</span> <span data-start="1107.509" data-end="1109.61">mattress interpreted and for long</span> <span data-start="1109.61" data-end="1113.57">strange we hit the v8 maximum function</span> <span data-start="1113.57"

data-end="1122.899">at the first precision or started first</span> <span data-start="1122.899" data-end="1124.73">pictures and if this doesn't work move</span> <span data-start="1124.73" data-end="1127.309">to the next position plus one and then</span> <span data-start="1127.309" data-end="1130.94">do it um are things there for regular</span> <span data-start="1130.94" data-end="1133.909">expressions are flags and so there's the</span> <span data-start="1133.909" data-end="1136.159">multi-line flag that you can pass to and</span> <span data-start="1136.159"

data-end="1143.029">expressions and they are pretty simple</span> <span data-start="1143.029" data-end="1144.86">to get right that if you have a new line</span> <span data-start="1144.86" data-end="1146.509">before after it should also match</span> <span data-start="1146.509" data-end="1149.259">there's a global match which basically</span> <span data-start="1149.259"
