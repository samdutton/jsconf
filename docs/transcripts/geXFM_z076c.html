data-end="151.06">kind of a pain</span> <span data-start="151.06" data-end="155.47">right so idea of theseus is to make it</span> <span data-start="155.47" data-end="157.39">easier to debug this stuff by basically</span> <span data-start="157.39" data-end="160">capturing information as we go along so</span> <span data-start="160" data-end="161.349">to see this let me go ahead and start a</span> <span data-start="161.349" data-end="163.51">brackets and if you haven't seen</span> <span data-start="163.51" data-end="165.25">brackets before you know as you can tell</span> <span data-start="165.25" data-end="166.9">pretty much looks like a text editor on</span> <span data-start="166.9" data-end="167.92">the surface right it's just got the</span> <span data-start="167.92" data-end="169.06">standard stuff you'd expect like code</span> <span data-start="169.06" data-end="170.769">coloring and it's got a little file tree</span> <span data-start="170.769" data-end="171.73">and stuff like that i'll show you some</span> <span data-start="171.73" data-end="173.08">of the more like specific features that</span> <span data-start="173.08" data-end="174.76">we already have in brackets later on but</span> <span data-start="174.76" data-end="175.93">right now you know and all this stuff is</span> <span data-start="175.93" data-end="178.38">built in HTML like I said in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="178.38" data-end="180.519">but let me go ahead and show you how</span> <span data-start="180.519" data-end="183.19">this Theseus stuff works so when we</span> <span data-start="183.19" data-end="185.86">start by starting the server for it so</span> <span data-start="185.86" data-end="187.12">this is my server app but what I'm going</span> <span data-start="187.12" data-end="188.41">to do is instead of starting at a node</span> <span data-start="188.41" data-end="190.6">i'm going to start it and no Theseus</span> <span data-start="190.6" data-end="191.65">which is going to instrument it in</span> <span data-start="191.65" data-end="193.11">certain ways that we'll talk about later</span> <span data-start="193.11" data-end="195.489">okay so this is running my node app now</span> <span data-start="195.489" data-end="198.04">and then from brackets I'm going to</span> <span data-start="198.04" data-end="200.2">enable Theseus and I'm going to go to</span> <span data-start="200.2" data-end="203.29">the source code for that project hoops</span> <span data-start="203.29" data-end="206.65">and I'm going to go into this live</span> <span data-start="206.65" data-end="208.45">development mode ok so now I'm running</span> <span data-start="208.45" data-end="209.65">this application and this is just like a</span> <span data-start="209.65" data-end="211.299">simple demo app it's a reservation</span> <span data-start="211.299" data-end="212.95">application right and so the ideas are</span> <span data-start="212.95" data-end="213.79">supposed to be able to select an</span> <span data-start="213.79" data-end="215.829">activity you want to do and then select</span> <span data-start="215.829" data-end="217.209">which date you want to do it on but as</span> <span data-start="217.209" data-end="219.01">you can see there's no actual dates in</span> <span data-start="219.01" data-end="220.69">the drop-down right so there's a bug</span> <span data-start="220.69" data-end="222.76">somewhere so where's the bug well it</span> <span data-start="222.76" data-end="224.68">could be in this event handler for this</span> <span data-start="224.68" data-end="226.69">drop-down right it could be that we're</span> <span data-start="226.69" data-end="228.22">not kicking off the Ajax request</span> <span data-start="228.22" data-end="229.78">properly it could be that on the server</span> <span data-start="229.78" data-end="230.92">side it's not accessing the database</span> <span data-start="230.92" data-end="232.45">properly or it's not returning the</span> <span data-start="232.45" data-end="233.769">response properly whatever so it could</span> <span data-start="233.769" data-end="235.6">be in a bunch of different places so</span> <span data-start="235.6" data-end="237.28">because we were running this all in the</span> <span data-start="237.28" data-end="238.93">context of Theseus we can actually go</span> <span data-start="238.93" data-end="242.35">back and look at our source code and now</span> <span data-start="242.35" data-end="243.73">i'm going to switch to my client side</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.73" data-end="245.2">JavaScript and you can see that as I've</span> <span data-start="245.2" data-end="247.09">been doing stuff it's actually been</span> <span data-start="247.09" data-end="248.44">capturing information on which functions</span> <span data-start="248.44" data-end="250.54">got called right and this is live so if</span> <span data-start="250.54" data-end="252.28">I go and I pick another activity let's</span> <span data-start="252.28" data-end="255.04">say you know like running or something</span> <span data-start="255.04" data-end="256.72">you can see that it updates what got</span> <span data-start="256.72" data-end="259.329">called so it's kind of useful and I can</span> <span data-start="259.329" data-end="260.38">also click on these things to get more</span> <span data-start="260.38" data-end="261.97">information so for example we can see</span> <span data-start="261.97" data-end="263.44">that our change handler got called to x</span> <span data-start="263.44" data-end="264.61">which is what we would expect as we pick</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="265.66">two different things from the background</span> <span data-start="265.66" data-end="271.65">yeah oh I'm sorry it's a better</span> <span data-start="271.65" data-end="279.79">it better all right okay so you can see</span> <span data-start="279.79" data-end="280.96">that we've got to change gentlefolk make</span> <span data-start="280.96" data-end="283">an even bigger so we've got change</span> <span data-start="283" data-end="285.13">handler here right and that got called</span> <span data-start="285.13" data-end="286.93">which is what we would expect and so I</span> <span data-start="286.93" data-end="288.52">can click on that and I'm sorry I can't</span> <span data-start="288.52" data-end="289.69">increase the font size of this right now</span> <span data-start="289.69" data-end="290.77">but basically it's showing the</span> <span data-start="290.77" data-end="292.27">information about each of those calls</span> <span data-start="292.27" data-end="294.43">and I can also look at some other stuff</span> <span data-start="294.43" data-end="295.84">like there's this set up dates function</span> <span data-start="295.84" data-end="297.91">which got called also twice and then</span> <span data-start="297.91" data-end="300.16">there's an ajax post and then there was</span> <span data-start="300.16" data-end="302.5">a callback function that got returned or</span> <span data-start="302.5" data-end="304.42">that got called when the data was</span> <span data-start="304.42" data-end="306.49">returned right so you click on all those</span> <span data-start="306.49" data-end="307.42">things and you can see that we're</span> <span data-start="307.42" data-end="308.56">actually showing in this log now</span> <span data-start="308.56" data-end="311.05">basically the causal chains here so the</span> <span data-start="311.05" data-end="312.61">change handler called set up dates and</span> <span data-start="312.61" data-end="314.32">then as a result of the post that got</span> <span data-start="314.32" data-end="316.36">done instead of dates get dates callback</span> <span data-start="316.36" data-end="318.64">got called and the interesting thing</span> <span data-start="318.64" data-end="320.29">here I mean a little side note is that</span> <span data-start="320.29" data-end="322.33">you know this isn't just a call stack</span> <span data-start="322.33" data-end="323.38">right like this is basically a call</span> <span data-start="323.38" data-end="325.09">stack but the get dates callback that I</span> <span data-start="325.09" data-end="326.53">should got called back asynchronously so</span> <span data-start="326.53" data-end="327.61">if you were to look at this in devtools</span> <span data-start="327.61" data-end="328.87">you wouldn't see it in the same call</span> <span data-start="328.87" data-end="330.91">stack because all that other stuff but</span> <span data-start="330.91" data-end="331.99">we're actually kind of tracking that</span> <span data-start="331.99" data-end="333.7">stuff and showing you how these</span> <span data-start="333.7" data-end="334.81">asynchronous things are related to each</span> <span data-start="334.81" data-end="337.09">other so I can look at this and I can</span> <span data-start="337.09" data-end="338.68">look at the return values from get dates</span> <span data-start="338.68" data-end="339.91">call back and you can see that the data</span> </p>

<span data-start="459.16" data-end="461.62">visualization of how the values of</span> <span data-start="461.62" data-end="463.15">variables change over time and as you</span> <span data-start="463.15" data-end="464.8">edit the code on the left the</span> <span data-start="464.8" data-end="466.419">visualization on the right hand side is</span> <span data-start="466.419" data-end="467.83">actually updating continuously as you're</span> <span data-start="467.83" data-end="468.82">typing so you're getting this sort of</span> <span data-start="468.82" data-end="470.44">live feedback how many people have seen</span> <span data-start="470.44" data-end="473.46">that that demo before all right cool</span> <span data-start="473.46" data-end="476.26">this is a kind of sort of novel thinking</span> <span data-start="476.26" data-end="477.91">that gets me really excited about the</span> <span data-start="477.91" data-end="480.4">future of JavaScript tooling and so I've</span> <span data-start="480.4" data-end="481.51">actually been working on something along</span> <span data-start="481.51" data-end="485.68">these lines and basically to looking at</span> <span data-start="485.68" data-end="486.669">some of the ways that you can branch out</span> <span data-start="486.669" data-end="489.22">from this idea so let me show you a bit</span> <span data-start="489.22" data-end="491.139">of that just going to take a little</span> <span data-start="491.139" data-end="496.84">quick switch a root here oh it's your</span> <span data-start="496.84" data-end="500.31">turn up disease</span> <span data-start="500.32" data-end="502">so I don't know if I can make the font</span> <span data-start="502" data-end="503.17">much bigger than that i haven't still</span> <span data-start="503.17" data-end="508.39">fit but hopefully it'll be okay so for</span> <span data-start="508.39" data-end="509.5">those of you haven't seen in demo here's</span> <span data-start="509.5" data-end="510.67">basically how it works you have some</span> <span data-start="510.67" data-end="513.01">code and as you make edits in the code</span> <span data-start="513.01" data-end="514.539">actually see the stuff on the right hand</span> <span data-start="514.539" data-end="515.919">side here is updating in real time it's</span> <span data-start="515.919" data-end="518.349">showing me how each value changes as its</span> <span data-start="518.349" data-end="520.3">assigned as its modified so as I'm</span> <span data-start="520.3" data-end="521.62">making edits here you can actually see</span> <span data-start="521.62" data-end="525.25">those values being modified so what's</span> <span data-start="525.25" data-end="526.48">really cool about this is it's taking</span> <span data-start="526.48" data-end="528.07">this traditional three-step cycle that</span> <span data-start="528.07" data-end="529.96">we're used to first you write code then</span> <span data-start="529.96" data-end="531.97">you test code then you debug the code to</span> <span data-start="531.97" data-end="533.92">find problems to fix the problems taking</span> <span data-start="533.92" data-end="535.39">those three steps and it's fusing them</span> <span data-start="535.39" data-end="537.37">to this one continuous ongoing process</span> <span data-start="537.37" data-end="538.9">so while you're writing code you're</span> <span data-start="538.9" data-end="541.48">continuously seeing live feedback as to</span> <span data-start="541.48" data-end="543.7">the results of executing that code and</span> <span data-start="543.7" data-end="544.6">when the result isn't what you expected</span> <span data-start="544.6" data-end="546.28">you already have this rich debug</span> <span data-start="546.28" data-end="548.2">information on the screen right right</span> <span data-start="548.2" data-end="550.39">there and I think that's actually a</span> <span data-start="550.39" data-end="551.65">combination of sort of two interrelated</span> <span data-start="551.65" data-end="554.02">ideas the first is this this sort of</span> <span data-start="554.02" data-end="555.91">idea of continuously executing the code</span> <span data-start="555.91" data-end="558.85">as you're making changes and to be able</span> <span data-start="558.85" data-end="560.08">to show you that live feedback and then</span> <span data-start="560.08" data-end="561.13">the second is this really rich</span> <span data-start="561.13" data-end="562.54">visualization you see on the right hand</span> <span data-start="562.54" data-end="565.21">side that's broader on the time spectrum</span> <span data-start="565.21" data-end="566.41">then when you get from a traditional</span> <span data-start="566.41" data-end="568.06">debugger so traditional debugger right</span> <span data-start="568.06" data-end="569.26">you're looking to this really narrow</span> <span data-start="569.26" data-end="570.79">window it's just an instant in time and</span> <span data-start="570.79" data-end="572.44">that's all you can see you can step</span> <span data-start="572.44" data-end="574.06">forwards but you're only looking through</span> <span data-start="574.06" data-end="576.01">a little sliver this is showing you a</span> <span data-start="576.01" data-end="577.99">more holistic view of the whole history</span> <span data-start="577.99" data-end="579.85">of the execution of the flow of</span> <span data-start="579.85" data-end="583.27">execution through the code and I think</span> <span data-start="583.27" data-end="584.53">that right hand side that visualization</span> <span data-start="584.53" data-end="587.41">can actually be made semantically more</span> <span data-start="587.41" data-end="589.99">rich in other ways to let me show you a</span> <span data-start="589.99" data-end="593.62">couple ideas that we had around that so</span> <span data-start="593.62" data-end="595">one thing you could do for example is</span> <span data-start="595" data-end="596.35">you can grow out blocks of code that</span> <span data-start="596.35" data-end="597.61">aren't being executed so that your eye</span> <span data-start="597.61" data-end="599.23">is just naturally drawn toward the</span> <span data-start="599.23" data-end="601.86">actual code path that the execution took</span> <span data-start="601.86" data-end="604.75">then if you have something that lets say</span> <span data-start="604.75" data-end="606.97">a loop being executed we can show you</span> <span data-start="606.97" data-end="609.25">the number of iterations that it</span> <span data-start="609.25" data-end="611.23">executed just a really quick way to get</span> <span data-start="611.23" data-end="612.37">a you know wrap your head around what</span> <span data-start="612.37" data-end="614.23">the codes been doing and then let's say</span> <span data-start="614.23" data-end="615.97">if you have a variable that's being used</span> <span data-start="615.97" data-end="618.67">as an index into an array we can</span> <span data-start="618.67" data-end="619.87">actually show you the value of that</span> <span data-start="619.87" data-end="621.64">variable not just as an integer sort of</span> <span data-start="621.64" data-end="623.98">floating out of context but actually as</span> <span data-start="623.98" data-end="626.62">an indicator on the array itself showing</span> <span data-start="626.62" data-end="629.32">you what member of the array that value</span> <span data-start="629.32" data-end="631.21">is actually pointing to so it's</span> <span data-start="631.21" data-end="632.68">basically beginning to give you sort of</span> <span data-start="632.68" data-end="633.85">this rich or semantic view</span> <span data-start="633.85" data-end="635.829">of what the values in the code mean and</span> <span data-start="635.829" data-end="637.149">what the execution of the code looks</span> <span data-start="637.149" data-end="640.24">like over time but skimming back to that</span> <span data-start="640.24" data-end="641.44">first thought that sort of continues to</span> <span data-start="641.44" data-end="643.72">re execution of the code one question</span> <span data-start="643.72" data-end="645.13">about that is whether that's actually</span> <span data-start="645.13" data-end="646.959">sort of a fatal flaw in this this whole</span> <span data-start="646.959" data-end="649.6">idea every time you see demos like this</span> <span data-start="649.6" data-end="651.399">it's always either a toy snippet of code</span> <span data-start="651.399" data-end="653.829">like this one or it's some kind of run</span> <span data-start="653.829" data-end="655.99">loop like in an animation or a game that</span> <span data-start="655.99" data-end="657.88">certain lends itself naturally to being</span> <span data-start="657.88" data-end="659.529">rerun over and over again because that's</span> <span data-start="659.529" data-end="661.329">what it's designed for and it's a</span> <span data-start="661.329" data-end="663.19">continuous we execute makes a lot of</span> <span data-start="663.19" data-end="665.259">sense there but you can't continuously</span> <span data-start="665.259" data-end="667.089">execute an entire web app as you're</span> <span data-start="667.089" data-end="668.44">typing like what does that even mean</span> <span data-start="668.44" data-end="671.98">doesn't make much sense this whole idea</span> <span data-start="671.98" data-end="674.649">is really predicated on taking a set of</span> <span data-start="674.649" data-end="676.75">code and isolating it along with its</span> <span data-start="676.75" data-end="678.639">inputs and sort of mocking away the rest</span> <span data-start="678.639" data-end="679.839">of the world to be able to do this</span> <span data-start="679.839" data-end="682.839">continuously execution to me that sounds</span> <span data-start="682.839" data-end="684.459">a lot like the process of writing good</span> <span data-start="684.459" data-end="686.62">unit tests isolating code mocking things</span> <span data-start="686.62" data-end="688.329">etc so I think it's really interesting</span> <span data-start="688.329" data-end="689.8">to look at all this from the perspective</span> <span data-start="689.8" data-end="693.25">of unit testing and tdd and I'll show</span> <span data-start="693.25" data-end="698.529">you an example of what I mean by that so</span> <span data-start="698.529" data-end="701.17">here's a no we got the lineup you should</span> <span data-start="701.17" data-end="702.339">let me make the font a little smaller</span> <span data-start="702.339" data-end="703.93">again sorry this is the low resolution</span> <span data-start="703.93" data-end="708.06">is a bit of a bit of an issue here but</span> <span data-start="708.06" data-end="713.36">no lower resolution I thought that I</span> <span data-start="713.37" data-end="717.39">oh yeah it keeps there we go the phone's</span> <span data-start="717.39" data-end="718.589">going to be really small I don't know</span> <span data-start="718.589" data-end="720.06">why we're getting that problem I think</span> <span data-start="720.06" data-end="721.38">it's on the other branch maybe but</span> <span data-start="721.38" data-end="725.16">anyway so oh that's okay hopefully</span> <span data-start="725.16" data-end="727.29">hopefully I'll kind of talk to the code</span> <span data-start="727.29" data-end="728.49">so if it's hard to read hopefully it'll</span> <span data-start="728.49" data-end="730.32">still make sense this code right here is</span> <span data-start="730.32" data-end="732.48">a function it takes an argument it's a</span> <span data-start="732.48" data-end="733.74">really crappy implementation of</span> <span data-start="733.74" data-end="736.65">converting a number to a string and so I</span> <span data-start="736.65" data-end="738">can fill in a hypothetical argument</span> <span data-start="738" data-end="740.79">value here to begin to see you know what</span> <span data-start="740.79" data-end="742.68">the code is doing but I can also fill in</span> <span data-start="742.68" data-end="744.81">an expected value and you can see that</span> <span data-start="744.81" data-end="746.13">the codes doing the wrong thing it's</span> <span data-start="746.13" data-end="747.029">actually getting stuck in an infinite</span> <span data-start="747.029" data-end="748.86">loop but let's set that aside for a</span> <span data-start="748.86" data-end="750.81">second and sort of do a test first so I</span> <span data-start="750.81" data-end="754.65">can add a few more test cases here 0 is</span> <span data-start="754.65" data-end="757.08">a good edge case negative numbers</span> <span data-start="757.08" data-end="759.33">another good edge case and like i said</span> <span data-start="759.33" data-end="760.71">this codes really crappy it's failing</span> <span data-start="760.71" data-end="762.27">every test case I can possibly think of</span> <span data-start="762.27" data-end="764.19">but that's fine let's go back to the</span> <span data-start="764.19" data-end="766.11">first one we've tried 120 and see if we</span> <span data-start="766.11" data-end="767.61">can actually get a sense of what's going</span> <span data-start="767.61" data-end="770.52">on here so we're expecting num to</span> <span data-start="770.52" data-end="773.13">converge down to zero and instead we can</span> <span data-start="773.13" data-end="774.12">see really easily hear that it's</span> <span data-start="774.12" data-end="775.23">actually just getting into smaller and</span> <span data-start="775.23" data-end="777.57">smaller floating-point numbers so that's</span> <span data-start="777.57" data-end="778.56">you know one of these sort of</span> <span data-start="778.56" data-end="780.57">traditional pitfalls in JavaScript an</span> <span data-start="780.57" data-end="781.98">integer division doesn't doesn't</span> <span data-start="781.98" data-end="784.23">truncate and we can really easily fix</span> <span data-start="784.23" data-end="785.94">that with just adding in a math that</span> <span data-start="785.94" data-end="788.67">floor here oh no it's doing it again let</span> <span data-start="788.67" data-end="789.98">me take some white space out of the code</span> <span data-start="789.98" data-end="793.79">sorry there we go so now we can see that</span> <span data-start="793.79" data-end="796.02">we're running three iterations for a</span> <span data-start="796.02" data-end="797.43">three digit number that's what we expect</span> <span data-start="797.43" data-end="798.99">the single digit case is actually</span> <span data-start="798.99" data-end="801.3">passing already now but if you can see</span> <span data-start="801.3" data-end="802.95">this it's actually outputting 0 to 1</span> <span data-start="802.95" data-end="804.81">instead of instead of 1 to 0 so it's</span> <span data-start="804.81" data-end="806.339">concatenated numbers in the wrong order</span> <span data-start="806.339" data-end="808.11">we're still getting bad output that's</span> <span data-start="808.11" data-end="811.74">luckily really easy to fix too so there</span> <span data-start="811.74" data-end="813.36">we go now we got the two cases passing</span> <span data-start="813.36" data-end="815.4">fixing the zeros really easy i can just</span> <span data-start="815.4" data-end="819.959">add in a little extra thing here and you</span> <span data-start="819.959" data-end="822.06">get the idea and i can make these fixes</span> <span data-start="822.06" data-end="823.29">sort of feeling confident that I'm not</span> <span data-start="823.29" data-end="824.49">breaking other stuff because all of</span> <span data-start="824.49" data-end="826.02">these test cases are being react</span> <span data-start="826.02" data-end="827.37">security continuously so they did</span> <span data-start="827.37" data-end="828.87">something stupid here like making it</span> <span data-start="828.87" data-end="830.85">always return 0 you immediately see the</span> <span data-start="830.85" data-end="832.02">feedback that some of the other test</span> <span data-start="832.02" data-end="835.68">cases had basically gone red and one</span> <span data-start="835.68" data-end="837.089">thing this brings to mind is I think</span> <span data-start="837.089" data-end="838.74">it's it's really important to sort of</span> <span data-start="838.74" data-end="840.48">begin seriously thinking about blurring</span> <span data-start="840.48" data-end="842.82">the line between these sort of one-off</span> <span data-start="842.82" data-end="844.41">test values that we throw around when</span> <span data-start="844.41" data-end="844.889">we're initial</span> <span data-start="844.889" data-end="846.029">writing code and getting it up and</span> <span data-start="846.029" data-end="848.67">running versus the more formal unit</span> <span data-start="848.67" data-end="850.079">tests that we keep around in the long</span> <span data-start="850.079" data-end="853.109">run and one way that we can do that is</span> <span data-start="853.109" data-end="855.269">to actually you know keep track of the</span> <span data-start="855.269" data-end="856.98">history of test values that you've been</span> <span data-start="856.98" data-end="859.129">using like we do here and then actually</span> <span data-start="859.129" data-end="861.989">generate an initial set of unit tests</span> <span data-start="861.989" data-end="864.809">for you sort of scaffolding based on the</span> <span data-start="864.809" data-end="866.009">testing that you've already been doing</span> <span data-start="866.009" data-end="872.879">so</span> <span data-start="872.889" data-end="875.269">so these are just a few ideas I think</span> <span data-start="875.269" data-end="876.949">there's lots more really awesome ideas</span> <span data-start="876.949" data-end="879.05">in this space and I'm really looking</span> <span data-start="879.05" data-end="880.339">forward to the day that we can start</span> <span data-start="880.339" data-end="882.079">using tools like this on on real world</span> <span data-start="882.079" data-end="885.079">large-scale code bases so thanks and</span> <span data-start="885.079" data-end="891.889">back to NJ it's totally on the wrong</span> <span data-start="891.889" data-end="895.42">branch for that sorry about that</span> <span data-start="895.43" data-end="898.07">yeah All Right see then get this thing</span> <span data-start="898.07" data-end="907.06">back on their way ok so good ok cool so</span> <span data-start="907.06" data-end="909.32">so I wanted to talk a little more about</span> <span data-start="909.32" data-end="911.33">this idea of sort of live JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="911.33" data-end="913.19">this is actually a live javascript</span> <span data-start="913.19" data-end="914.75">editing and sort of you know being able</span> <span data-start="914.75" data-end="916.13">to see results as you edit so how many</span> <span data-start="916.13" data-end="918.2">people saw peter van disease talk a few</span> <span data-start="918.2" data-end="921.44">hours ago ok bunch of people did you see</span> <span data-start="921.44" data-end="925.19">you saw your own tacos and so you know</span> <span data-start="925.19" data-end="926.66">he did this great job showing an</span> <span data-start="926.66" data-end="929.089">approach to this you know there's been a</span> <span data-start="929.089" data-end="931.07">lot of activity in this space and a few</span> <span data-start="931.07" data-end="932.69">short of light table but those guys are</span> <span data-start="932.69" data-end="934.22">looking into this I think some of the</span> <span data-start="934.22" data-end="935.779">other sort of web IDs have been looking</span> <span data-start="935.779" data-end="936.77">into this as well and it's something</span> <span data-start="936.77" data-end="937.76">that obviously we've been thinking about</span> <span data-start="937.76" data-end="941.149">to and I worked on this part and I</span> <span data-start="941.149" data-end="942.32">didn't think you needed to see my face</span> <span data-start="942.32" data-end="944.3">behind me on the screen so i didn't</span> <span data-start="944.3" data-end="947.149">bother to picture myself in a bit so</span> <span data-start="947.149" data-end="948.64">i've been think about this and sort of</span> <span data-start="948.64" data-end="951.19">looking into an approach to doing this</span> <span data-start="951.19" data-end="953.899">that you know sort of interesting but</span> <span data-start="953.899" data-end="956.27">also a little bit weird and so this is</span> <span data-start="956.27" data-end="958.01">definitely going to be maybe a little</span> <span data-start="958.01" data-end="959.959">bit more grotesque than you might want</span> <span data-start="959.959" data-end="961.97">to see but hopefully won't claw your</span> <span data-start="961.97" data-end="965.57">eyes out all right so let me give a</span> <span data-start="965.57" data-end="966.92">little example of what we have in</span> <span data-start="966.92" data-end="968.779">brackets today and then i'll show how</span> <span data-start="968.779" data-end="969.709">we're doing how we can do things</span> <span data-start="969.709" data-end="972.05">differently so right now in brackets</span> <span data-start="972.05" data-end="973.49">actually a switch different project here</span> <span data-start="973.49" data-end="976.25">we have a very we have a notion of live</span> <span data-start="976.25" data-end="978.529">development right so the idea is you can</span> <span data-start="978.529" data-end="983.45">go into an application here or a website</span> <span data-start="983.45" data-end="986.48">and i can open it in the browser in this</span> <span data-start="986.48" data-end="988.4">live development mode and then for CSS</span> <span data-start="988.4" data-end="989.69">we can do things like you know as you</span> <span data-start="989.69" data-end="992.06">make edits the font size here right like</span> <span data-start="992.06" data-end="993.98">as i'm editing the color you can see</span> <span data-start="993.98" data-end="994.97">that it updates the color in the browser</span> <span data-start="994.97" data-end="996.589">is on typing you know i can do things</span> <span data-start="996.589" data-end="997.97">like it a padding or whatever right so</span> <span data-start="997.97" data-end="999.44">this is sort of a it kind of really</span> <span data-start="999.44" data-end="1000.579">makes this really immediate feedback</span> <span data-start="1000.579" data-end="1001.66">loop between what you're doing kind of</span> <span data-start="1001.66" data-end="1003.94">like what what Peter was showing and it</span> <span data-start="1003.94" data-end="1004.75">turns out this is actually pretty easy</span> <span data-start="1004.75" data-end="1006.22">to do for CSS because it's declarative</span> <span data-start="1006.22" data-end="1007.63">right and in fact the chrome what we're</span> <span data-start="1007.63" data-end="1009.25">doing is we're connecting remotely to</span> <span data-start="1009.25" data-end="1010.54">the chrome developer tools over a web</span> <span data-start="1010.54" data-end="1012.04">socket and they were just pushing new</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1012.04" data-end="1014.14">CSS at it and it knows how to replace</span> <span data-start="1014.14" data-end="1016.99">that stuff on the fly now the thing is</span> <span data-start="1016.99" data-end="1017.89">if you think about doing that for</span> <span data-start="1017.89" data-end="1019">javascript is actually a lot harder and</span> <span data-start="1019" data-end="1020.23">again if you saw peter van der disease</span> <span data-start="1020.23" data-end="1022.18">talk you talk about something changes</span> <span data-start="1022.18" data-end="1024.16">there it turns out that chrome does some</span> <span data-start="1024.16" data-end="1025.36">of that stuff already so if you push a</span> <span data-start="1025.36" data-end="1026.679">whole new script at chrome it'll</span> <span data-start="1026.679" data-end="1028.9">actually replace function definitions</span> <span data-start="1028.9" data-end="1031.15">at least in some cases but it won't off</span> <span data-start="1031.15" data-end="1032.68">so it won't always work and I'll talk</span> <span data-start="1032.68" data-end="1034.75">about some of the edge cases as I do</span> <span data-start="1034.75" data-end="1038.89">this next demo so let me actually switch</span> <span data-start="1038.89" data-end="1040.21">to a different building brackets that</span> <span data-start="1040.21" data-end="1041.53">has some different lab development stuff</span> <span data-start="1041.53" data-end="1047.45">in it this is my prototype code here and</span> <span data-start="1047.46" data-end="1051.64">it is okay so this is a really stupid</span> <span data-start="1051.64" data-end="1054.25">app basically you click this button then</span> <span data-start="1054.25" data-end="1055.33">every time you click the button it shows</span> <span data-start="1055.33" data-end="1057.07">a new number or it increments a number</span> <span data-start="1057.07" data-end="1059.98">and it prints out a message right so in</span> <span data-start="1059.98" data-end="1061.63">this version of the live development</span> <span data-start="1061.63" data-end="1062.92">mode what I've done is I basically taken</span> <span data-start="1062.92" data-end="1064.93">the existing JavaScript file and I've</span> <span data-start="1064.93" data-end="1066.43">instrumented it in such a way that we</span> <span data-start="1066.43" data-end="1068.05">can do various kinds of live code</span> <span data-start="1068.05" data-end="1070.12">replacement on it so again somewhat</span> <span data-start="1070.12" data-end="1071.32">similar to some of this to Peter had</span> <span data-start="1071.32" data-end="1073.57">there so for example I can go here and I</span> <span data-start="1073.57" data-end="1076.24">can change this to new message and then</span> <span data-start="1076.24" data-end="1077.68">without reloading the application or</span> <span data-start="1077.68" data-end="1078.82">whatever just pushing a new function</span> <span data-start="1078.82" data-end="1080.02">definition you can see that it's showing</span> <span data-start="1080.02" data-end="1081.43">the new message here all right so I</span> <span data-start="1081.43" data-end="1082.99">haven't reloaded the app IM say anything</span> <span data-start="1082.99" data-end="1085.33">like that so that's pretty that's you</span> <span data-start="1085.33" data-end="1088.24">know one thing you can do another thing</span> <span data-start="1088.24" data-end="1089.35">you can do is you can actually add new</span> <span data-start="1089.35" data-end="1090.91">functions here so let me go ahead and</span> <span data-start="1090.91" data-end="1091.9">change this to list i want to do a</span> <span data-start="1091.9" data-end="1093.22">little refactoring i do i make it so</span> <span data-start="1093.22" data-end="1096.22">that I can you know add five every time</span> <span data-start="1096.22" data-end="1097.84">instead of account and I'm going to do</span> <span data-start="1097.84" data-end="1099.46">that by defining a new function so that</span> <span data-start="1099.46" data-end="1101.67">function is going to take the amount and</span> <span data-start="1101.67" data-end="1103.51">it's just going to add that to the count</span> <span data-start="1103.51" data-end="1106.21">right okay so now I click on this button</span> <span data-start="1106.21" data-end="1107.95">now you can see that it's now</span> <span data-start="1107.95" data-end="1109.45">incrementing by five right and again I</span> <span data-start="1109.45" data-end="1111.61">didn't reload the app I didn't save or</span> <span data-start="1111.61" data-end="1115.51">anything like that so you know one thing</span> <span data-start="1115.51" data-end="1117.1">that's interesting about this case that</span> <span data-start="1117.1" data-end="1120.37">makes it kind of hard is that you know</span> <span data-start="1120.37" data-end="1123.04">this new function i defined and the old</span> <span data-start="1123.04" data-end="1124.42">function that it's referring to in the</span> <span data-start="1124.42" data-end="1125.77">and the code that it's referring to</span> <span data-start="1125.77" data-end="1127.3">before like that stuff was all in this</span> <span data-start="1127.3" data-end="1128.77">module closure right so this there's</span> <span data-start="1128.77" data-end="1130.51">this closure actor called my lager and</span> <span data-start="1130.51" data-end="1133.48">that's what we actually use you know we</span> <span data-start="1133.48" data-end="1135.4">put our functions in that to sort of</span> <span data-start="1135.4" data-end="1137.32">hide the implementation details and then</span> <span data-start="1137.32" data-end="1139.42">we call it from this click handler so I</span> <span data-start="1139.42" data-end="1141.31">didn't actually reacts acute this module</span> <span data-start="1141.31" data-end="1142.42">right because I didn't want to lose the</span> <span data-start="1142.42" data-end="1144.1">existing modules state I didn't want to</span> <span data-start="1144.1" data-end="1145.99">reset this count variable right we want</span> <span data-start="1145.99" data-end="1147.22">to keep that state we just want to add a</span> <span data-start="1147.22" data-end="1148.66">new function into the closure and we</span> <span data-start="1148.66" data-end="1150.43">want that function to be able to see the</span> <span data-start="1150.43" data-end="1151.87">current state of what was in that outer</span> <span data-start="1151.87" data-end="1154.54">closure but if you don't reacts acute</span> <span data-start="1154.54" data-end="1155.74">the outer function then how do you stuff</span> <span data-start="1155.74" data-end="1157.81">something new into it right because this</span> <span data-start="1157.81" data-end="1159.28">is JavaScript and these closures I mean</span> <span data-start="1159.28" data-end="1160.36">that's why they're called closures right</span> <span data-start="1160.36" data-end="1161.11">they're not they're supposed to be</span> <span data-start="1161.11" data-end="1162.52">sealed not supposed to be able to poke</span> <span data-start="1162.52" data-end="1164.2">new stuff into an existing closure and</span> <span data-start="1164.2" data-end="1165.76">furthermore have the existing stuff in</span> <span data-start="1165.76" data-end="1167.65">that closure be able to see new stuff</span> <span data-start="1167.65" data-end="1168.94">that you add to it if that old stuff</span> <span data-start="1168.94" data-end="1170.74">gets re-execute 'add without we executed</span> <span data-start="1170.74" data-end="1172.72">the whole module to begin with right how</span> <span data-start="1172.72" data-end="1177.55">does that work sorry was that you're</span> <span data-start="1177.55" data-end="1180.52">like a rhetorical question there all</span> <span data-start="1180.52" data-end="1182.86">right how does it work all right so let</span> <span data-start="1182.86" data-end="1185.74">me go through celebs sorry all right so</span> <span data-start="1185.74" data-end="1186.49">let's talk about the first function</span> <span data-start="1186.49" data-end="1187.51">replacement case I'm not going to go</span> <span data-start="1187.51" data-end="1188.5">into a lot of detail of this because</span> <span data-start="1188.5" data-end="1189.91">it's actually quite similar to the</span> <span data-start="1189.91" data-end="1192.07">technique I think that that Peter used</span> <span data-start="1192.07" data-end="1194.47">in his talk so the basic idea is let's</span> <span data-start="1194.47" data-end="1196.03">say I start with this code right this is</span> <span data-start="1196.03" data-end="1197.62">my script that I type in to my editor</span> <span data-start="1197.62" data-end="1199.51">right and says my fog you know</span> <span data-start="1199.51" data-end="1201.64">console.log old message so like I</span> <span data-start="1201.64" data-end="1204.07">mentioned before what we do is we before</span> <span data-start="1204.07" data-end="1205.21">sending the script to the browser we</span> <span data-start="1205.21" data-end="1206.95">actually rewrite it by basically putting</span> <span data-start="1206.95" data-end="1208.54">in a chunk of extra code into every</span> <span data-start="1208.54" data-end="1210.19">function that's in the original script</span> <span data-start="1210.19" data-end="1212.11">file and that code looks like this so</span> <span data-start="1212.11" data-end="1214.3">you start with the original code which</span> <span data-start="1214.3" data-end="1216.94">is here right and then I basically say</span> <span data-start="1216.94" data-end="1218.38">okay I'm going to create this table of</span> <span data-start="1218.38" data-end="1220.3">function replacements and so before</span> <span data-start="1220.3" data-end="1222.1">every time I enter this function instead</span> <span data-start="1222.1" data-end="1223.21">of just executing the code I'd</span> <span data-start="1223.21" data-end="1225.16">originally written I'm going to look</span> <span data-start="1225.16" data-end="1227.08">into that table and see if there's a new</span> <span data-start="1227.08" data-end="1228.16">definition and if there is i'm just</span> <span data-start="1228.16" data-end="1230.5">going to eval it otherwise i'm going to</span> <span data-start="1230.5" data-end="1231.94">use the original function definition and</span> <span data-start="1231.94" data-end="1234.16">then once i have that i can just call</span> <span data-start="1234.16" data-end="1235.75">funked out apply this common arguments</span> <span data-start="1235.75" data-end="1237.04">in order to make it evaluate the same</span> <span data-start="1237.04" data-end="1238.15">way the original function would have</span> <span data-start="1238.15" data-end="1240.13">right so it's a pretty straightforward</span> <span data-start="1240.13" data-end="1242.5">trick and as again Peter point out has</span> <span data-start="1242.5" data-end="1243.64">talked one of the nice things about is</span> <span data-start="1243.64" data-end="1245.29">that if you do this eval in the context</span> <span data-start="1245.29" data-end="1246.91">of this function you get all the outer</span> <span data-start="1246.91" data-end="1248.77">closure state right all that stuff stays</span> <span data-start="1248.77" data-end="1251.89">preserved right and then when you want</span> <span data-start="1251.89" data-end="1253.54">to send a new function over from the</span> <span data-start="1253.54" data-end="1254.86">editor right so the user makes an edit</span> <span data-start="1254.86" data-end="1256.75">and the editor you just send it over the</span> <span data-start="1256.75" data-end="1259.06">browser and then it steps that back into</span> <span data-start="1259.06" data-end="1262.81">this table here okay so the question</span> <span data-start="1262.81" data-end="1264.19">though is how do we do this other case</span> <span data-start="1264.19" data-end="1265.27">right how do we do this case where</span> <span data-start="1265.27" data-end="1266.5">you've got a closure that you don't want</span> <span data-start="1266.5" data-end="1267.97">to re-evaluate you don't want to rerun</span> <span data-start="1267.97" data-end="1271.18">this closure and you have some stuff in</span> <span data-start="1271.18" data-end="1272.77">it that gets you know basically defined</span> <span data-start="1272.77" data-end="1273.91">when you first execute it right so i</span> <span data-start="1273.91" data-end="1275.08">define a variable i define a function</span> <span data-start="1275.08" data-end="1277.99">that logs that variable and then you</span> <span data-start="1277.99" data-end="1280">know as the user I'm in my code editor</span> <span data-start="1280" data-end="1281.53">and I go and make some edits and what I</span> <span data-start="1281.53" data-end="1283.09">do is I basically introduce this new</span> <span data-start="1283.09" data-end="1284.92">function that refers to a variable that</span> <span data-start="1284.92" data-end="1287.02">was already in the closure and then also</span> <span data-start="1287.02" data-end="1289.21">the existing function here I make a call</span> <span data-start="1289.21" data-end="1291.25">that new function right so there's two</span> <span data-start="1291.25" data-end="1292.75">things going on here right both the new</span> <span data-start="1292.75" data-end="1294.01">function has to be able to see the stuff</span> <span data-start="1294.01" data-end="1295.24">that was in the closure to begin with</span> <span data-start="1295.24" data-end="1295.86">this</span> <span data-start="1295.86"

data-end="1301.38">the new function after its content gets</span> <span data-start="1301.38" data-end="1302.79">replaced using the technique we showed a</span> <span data-start="1302.79" data-end="1304.65">little while ago right in the previous</span> <span data-start="1304.65" data-end="1307.44">slide so long ago all right so how do we</span> <span data-start="1307.44" data-end="1309.03">do it well we use the scrote a grotesque</span> <span data-start="1309.03" data-end="1311.34">hack which is with and so most you</span> <span data-start="1311.34" data-end="1312.45">probably know it with is and you know</span> <span data-start="1312.45" data-end="1313.53">mostly that you're not supposed to use</span> <span data-start="1313.53"

data-start="1324.36" data-end="1325.98">to have say like some obtained and some</span> <span data-start="1325.98" data-end="1328.26">object I HR whatever if you wrap stuff</span> <span

data-start="1338.79" data-end="1339.72">i said it's this weird convenience</span> <span data-start="1339.72" data-end="1340.86">feature nobody really uses it it's</span> <span data-start="1340.86" data-end="1342.78">actually deprecated new versions of java</span> <span data-start="1342.78" data-end="1346.02">script but and it's partly because it's</span> <span data-start="1346.02" data-end="1347.13">just weird right that's like it's</span> <span data-start="1347.13" data-end="1348.33">injecting all this random stuff at your</span> <span data-start="1348.33" data-end="1349.62">local scope least ambiguities and things</span> <span data-start="1349.62" data-end="1351.84">like that but this is actually the the</span> <span data-start="1351.84" data-end="1352.98">feature that makes it so that we can</span> <span data-start="1352.98" data-end="1354.6">actually use it to prototype this kind</span> <span data-start="1354.6" data-end="1357.78">of injection of stuff into an existing</span> <span data-start="1357.78" data-end="1360.69">closure so how does that work well again</span> <span data-start="1360.69" data-end="1362.13">we'll start with the original code right</span> <span data-start="1362.13" data-end="1363.809">which was there was this module and it</span> <span data-start="1363.809" data-end="1366.54">had this variable and this function in</span> <span data-start="1366.54" data-end="1368.16">it and so we're going to add a little</span> <span data-start="1368.16" data-end="1369.45">more code to it what we're going to do</span> <span data-start="1369.45" data-end="1370.41">is we're gonna start by just creating an</span> <span data-start="1370.41" data-end="1371.58">empty object we're going to store it off</span> <span data-start="1371.58" data-end="1372.84">in a table so we can refer to it later</span> <span data-start="1372.84" data-end="1374.76">and then we're going to say with that</span> <span data-start="1374.76" data-end="1376.86">empty object do this stuff we were going</span> <span data-start="1376.86" data-end="1377.88">to define the things that we were</span> <span data-start="1377.88" data-end="1379.02">originally going to define the module</span> <span data-start="1379.02" data-end="1382.26">and then take all of the things that</span> <span data-start="1382.26" data-end="1383.64">we're defined in that module and stuff</span> <span data-start="1383.64" data-end="1386.46">them into this scope variable right into</span> <span data-start="1386.46" data-end="1389.13">the scope object so because of the with</span> <span data-start="1389.13" data-end="1391.02">here all those things essentially get</span> <span data-start="1391.02" data-end="1392.79">readded into the local scope here but</span> <span data-start="1392.79" data-end="1394.08">that's kind of a no operate that doesn't</span> <span data-start="1394.08" data-end="1395.19">do anything because they were already in</span> <span data-start="1395.19" data-end="1398.49">local scopes who cares but the trick is</span> <span data-start="1398.49" data-end="1399.75">now when you want to go to find a new</span> <span data-start="1399.75" data-end="1400.95">function and you wanted to see all that</span> <span data-start="1400.95" data-end="1402.75">stuff and be seen by all that stuff you</span> <span data-start="1402.75" data-end="1404.01">can just wrap it with the same scope</span> <span data-start="1404.01" data-end="1405.929">object and then you can copy a pointer</span> <span data-start="1405.929" data-end="1407.13">to that new function again into the</span> <span data-start="1407.13" data-end="1410.13">scope object right and so now when the</span> <span data-start="1410.13" data-end="1412.32">new function executes it sees all of the</span> <span data-start="1412.32" data-end="1413.73">local stuff that had previously been</span> <span data-start="1413.73" data-end="1415.32">defined in the module because it got</span> <span data-start="1415.32" data-end="1416.76">copied over into the scope variable</span> <span data-start="1416.76" data-end="1419.97">right and then if you re-enter this</span> <span data-start="1419.97" data-end="1421.5">internal function right there's my funk</span> <span data-start="1421.5" data-end="1422.91">right this is the same thing that like</span> <span data-start="1422.91" data-end="1424.02">that logger function in the original</span> <span data-start="1424.02" data-end="1427.74">example right then it can actually see</span> <span data-start="1427.74" data-end="1429.81">the new function because it got added to</span> <span data-start="1429.81" data-end="1432.06">the same scope so basically what gives</span> <span data-start="1432.06" data-end="1434.76">you as a way of exposing and consuming</span> <span data-start="1434.76" data-end="1436.62">the lexical scope you know some random</span> <span data-start="1436.62" data-end="1438.45">place in your code exposing it as a</span> <span data-start="1438.45" data-end="1440.58">dynamic object dynamic scope that you</span> <span data-start="1440.58" data-end="1443.09">can then poke out and mess with right</span> <span data-start="1443.09" data-end="1445.71">alright so big deal like why why would</span> <span data-start="1445.71" data-end="1446.88">you even want to do this right like it</span> <span data-start="1446.88" data-end="1450.21">gets weird and confusing and so I think</span> <span data-start="1450.21" data-end="1451.89">the reason that I'm interested in it is</span> <span data-start="1451.89" data-end="1453.6">because you know if you again if you</span> <span data-start="1453.6" data-end="1454.65">went to Peter sake point out that</span> <span data-start="1454.65" data-end="1456.6">there's a lot of cases where it just</span> <span data-start="1456.6" data-end="1458.34">gets hard to do live JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1458.34" data-end="1461.22">development well right like it's one</span> <span data-start="1461.22" data-end="1462.54">thing to replace the content of an</span> <span data-start="1462.54" data-end="1463.62">existing function that just going to get</span> <span data-start="1463.62" data-end="1465.21">executed again you know like Peter was</span> <span data-start="1465.21" data-end="1466.35">saying or if you if you're in like an</span> <span data-start="1466.35" data-end="1467.64">animate loop or something or you're just</span> <span data-start="1467.64" data-end="1469.44">continuously executing it if you just</span> <span data-start="1469.44" data-end="1470.64">add a bit of imperative code somewhere</span> <span data-start="1470.64" data-end="1471.9">in a scope where you don't want to</span> <span data-start="1471.9" data-end="1473.73">re-execute that whole thing again you</span> <span data-start="1473.73" data-end="1474.96">know it's not that easy to do and so</span> <span data-start="1474.96" data-end="1476.43">there's just a bunch of these edge cases</span> <span data-start="1476.43" data-end="1477.78">and things that I think are difficult so</span> <span data-start="1477.78" data-end="1479.37">what we really want to do is sort of</span> <span data-start="1479.37" data-end="1480.83">prototype this stuff as much as we can</span> <span data-start="1480.83" data-end="1483">using pure JavaScript and using whatever</span> <span data-start="1483" data-end="1484.65">hacks we need to but ultimately I think</span> <span data-start="1484.65" data-end="1486.63">what we really want to do is lobby the</span> <span data-start="1486.63" data-end="1489.18">vm makers you know v8 and JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1489.18" data-end="1491.55">core and spider makino them to basically</span> <span data-start="1491.55" data-end="1493.32">add more support for this kind of live</span> <span data-start="1493.32" data-end="1494.46">development into the vm you know the</span> <span data-start="1494.46" data-end="1496.17">same way that the Java VM is added you</span> <span data-start="1496.17" data-end="1497.31">know stuff like jaco replacing and</span> <span data-start="1497.31" data-end="1498.66">things like that and again you know some</span> <span data-start="1498.66" data-end="1499.68">of them are already starting to do this</span> <span data-start="1499.68" data-end="1500.94">like there's a little bit of this and v8</span> <span data-start="1500.94" data-end="1502.65">already but if we can get them if we can</span> <span data-start="1502.65" data-end="1503.64">figure out like what are the right</span> <span data-start="1503.64" data-end="1505.14">primitives that we need in the vm to</span> <span data-start="1505.14" data-end="1506.52">support the style of live development</span> <span data-start="1506.52" data-end="1508.08">then you know we could get that stuff</span> <span data-start="1508.08" data-end="1509.16">into the vm and then all of the</span> <span data-start="1509.16" data-end="1510.72">schooling you know those brackets or</span> <span data-start="1510.72" data-end="1512.16">light table or whatever can take</span> <span data-start="1512.16" data-end="1516.27">advantage of it so let's say either okay</span> <span data-start="1516.27" data-end="1518.43">that was pretty nerdy hey it's jase</span> <span data-start="1518.43" data-end="1520.62">girlfriend so let me skip to one more</span> <span data-start="1520.62" data-end="1522.06">thing which is well it's a different</span>

data-start="1527.94" data-end="1529.05">bout JavaScript development this is</span> <span data-start="1529.05" data-end="1530.67">about CSS development it was done by</span> <span data-start="1530.67" data-end="1532.5">this guy League brim below who works at</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1532.5" data-end="1536.46">Adobe and so what I'm going to do real</span> <span data-start="1536.46" data-end="1538.14">quick is again for context i'm going to</span> <span data-start="1538.14" data-end="1538.92">show you some features that are already</span> <span data-start="1538.92" data-end="1540.12">in brackets and then show you how he's</span> <span data-start="1540.12" data-end="1541.92">building on top of that to provide an</span> <span data-start="1541.92" data-end="1545.34">experience for a responsive design so if</span> <span data-start="1545.34" data-end="1548.4">i go back to my example file here one of</span> <span data-start="1548.4" data-end="1549.48">the things that we have when these</span> <span data-start="1549.48" data-end="1550.5">features that we have in brackets is</span> <span data-start="1550.5" data-end="1551.82">this idea of inline editing so the idea</span> <span data-start="1551.82" data-end="1555.96">is that if i am in like an HTML tag for</span> <span data-start="1555.96" data-end="1557.34">example and i want to see the CSS</span> <span data-start="1557.34" data-end="1558.99">associated with that tag is everything</span> <span data-start="1558.99" data-end="1560.46">to like go and dig around my CSS file</span> <span data-start="1560.46" data-end="1561.96">for it I can just hit this quick edit</span> <span data-start="1561.96" data-end="1563.29">key and what it does is it actually</span> <span data-start="1563.29" data-end="1565.48">is open The Associated CSS rule right in</span> <span data-start="1565.48" data-end="1566.62">line there so I can just tweak it and</span> <span data-start="1566.62" data-end="1568">then get out so I can't really get into</span> <span data-start="1568" data-end="1569.56">this sort of mode if I'm just like in my</span> <span data-start="1569.56" data-end="1571.57">same file and just editing editing stuff</span> <span data-start="1571.57" data-end="1573.43">from the CSS and then I can pop out and</span> <span data-start="1573.43" data-end="1575.2">we use this idea of inline editing all</span> <span data-start="1575.2" data-end="1577.72">over the place like we use it for you</span> <span data-start="1577.72" data-end="1579.19">know for things like colors so like if I</span> <span data-start="1579.19" data-end="1580.48">the color here I can pop them in an</span> <span data-start="1580.48" data-end="1582.91">online editor for the color if you're on</span> <span data-start="1582.91" data-end="1585.25">a CSS property you can get docs from the</span> <span data-start="1585.25" data-end="1587.11">web platform docks project and see it in</span> <span data-start="1587.11" data-end="1588.13">line and stuff like that so it's just a</span> <span data-start="1588.13" data-end="1590.5">sort of you I idea that we had for</span> <span data-start="1590.5" data-end="1592.42">making it just kind of quicker to work</span> <span data-start="1592.42" data-end="1593.7">back and forth between different context</span> <span data-start="1593.7" data-end="1595.99">so Italy did was he took this idea and</span> <span data-start="1595.99" data-end="1598.93">he added to it to enable some responsive</span> <span data-start="1598.93" data-end="1600.07">design stuff and then let's talk about</span> <span data-start="1600.07" data-end="1602.71">what that means so I'm going to open his</span> <span data-start="1602.71" data-end="1605.35">responsive design extension here errors</span> <span data-start="1605.35" data-end="1607.69">totally fine and it's not a bug in my in</span> <span data-start="1607.69" data-end="1611.68">my demo and so the idea here in the the</span> <span data-start="1611.68" data-end="1613.48">concept behind this is so you know when</span> <span data-start="1613.48" data-end="1615.39">you're doing responsive designs stuff</span> <span data-start="1615.39" data-end="1617.47">you know we've got we're starting to</span> <span data-start="1617.47" data-end="1618.82">work on things like tools for designers</span> <span data-start="1618.82" data-end="1620.32">to make it easier for them to to do this</span> <span data-start="1620.32" data-end="1622.06">stuff we've got this project called</span> <span data-start="1622.06" data-end="1624.67">reflow that we've started up for that</span> <span data-start="1624.67" data-end="1626.38">but if you're a coder right primarily</span> <span data-start="1626.38" data-end="1627.22">what you're doing is you're living in</span> <span data-start="1627.22" data-end="1628.54">your code all day but you might want a</span> <span data-start="1628.54" data-end="1629.89">little help with sort of visualizing</span> <span data-start="1629.89" data-end="1630.97">what the results of your responsive</span> <span data-start="1630.97" data-end="1633.37">design stuff is going to be so we built</span> <span data-start="1633.37"
