been this kind of clutch it's</span> <span data-start="30.05" data-end="32.72">grown organically into more or less a</span> <span data-start="32.72" data-end="36.11">mess it has no sense of cohesion most of</span> <span data-start="36.11" data-end="37.58">the API is that we have to deal with</span> <span data-start="37.58" data-end="40.25">have been poorly designed by C++</span> <span data-start="40.25" data-end="42.5">developers and they write them in this</span> <span data-start="42.5" data-end="45.14">binding layer called IDL which was</span> <span data-start="45.14" data-end="47.57">originally meant for korba if you can</span> <span data-start="47.57" data-end="51.019">believe that and and you know even more</span> <span data-start="51.019" data-end="53.03">so than just the the problems with what</span> <span data-start="53.03" data-end="54.8">we already have there's a things we</span> <span data-start="54.8" data-end="56.719">don't have there's the major gaps in</span> <span data-start="56.719" data-end="59.21">what we can do on the web compared to</span> <span data-start="59.21" data-end="61.37">native apps compared to desktop apps</span> <span data-start="61.37" data-end="64.009">compared to mobile apps and even for</span> <span data-start="64.009" data-end="65.99">those things we can do we end up doing</span> <span data-start="65.99" data-end="68.119">them mostly by drowning ourselves in</span> <span data-start="68.119" data-end="71.09">large JavaScript libraries that polyfill</span> <span data-start="71.09" data-end="72.95">like this functionality that we need or</span> <span data-start="72.95" data-end="74.869">let us create a new select element so</span> <span data-start="74.869" data-end="77.539">that we just really we can style it so</span> <span data-start="77.539" data-end="79.369">why does this happen what's what's the</span> <span data-start="79.369" data-end="81.11">problem with the web with this platform</span> <span data-start="81.11" data-end="84.02">that we've we all love and work on well</span> <span data-start="84.02" data-end="86.42">the problem is really in the process I</span> <span data-start="86.42" data-end="89.24">claim and the deal is that generally</span> <span data-start="89.24" data-end="91.61">when we introduce new features into our</span> <span data-start="91.61" data-end="94.369">web platform it's done via this this</span> <span data-start="94.369" data-end="96.59">complicated waterfall this months or</span> <span data-start="96.59" data-end="98.869">years of mailing lists standardization</span> <span data-start="98.869" data-end="101.869">where people debate to no end like the</span> <span data-start="101.869" data-end="103.97">my new details of how exactly the</span> <span data-start="103.97" data-end="106.49">perfect API should work from their</span> <span data-start="106.49" data-end="108.619">perspective and they write it down in</span> <span data-start="108.619" data-end="111.35">prose or in this this web IDL interface</span> <span data-start="111.35" data-end="113.299">definition language and there in the end</span> <span data-start="113.299" data-end="114.92">they're really driven by this scenario</span> <span data-start="114.92" data-end="116.659">solving idea where they say oh we have</span> <span data-start="116.659" data-end="118.159">this problem we need to solve it let's</span> <span data-start="118.159" data-end="120.649">let's throw some C++ over the wall</span> <span data-start="120.649" data-end="124.219">attach a tag name to it and then say oh</span> <span data-start="124.219" data-end="126.89">here you go here's your API so we get</span> <span data-start="126.89" data-end="128.63">this fundamental capability that we want</span> <span data-start="128.63" data-end="130.94">but instead of getting a kind of exposed</span> <span data-start="130.94" data-end="133.28">in a way we want to use we get this high</span> <span data-start="133.28" data-end="135.98">level thing that just burrows down from</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="139.459">some tag down to C++ we can't customize</span> <span data-start="139.459" data-end="141.17">it we can't work with it in the way that</span> <span data-start="141.17" data-end="142.43">we'd want to if we'd written it</span> <span data-start="142.43" data-end="145.37">ourselves in JavaScript and all this</span> <span data-start="145.37" data-end="146.989">time you know you eventually get this</span> <span data-start="146.989" data-end="150.079">thing as troublesome as it may be well</span> <span data-start="150.079" data-end="151.669">you try and use it and you end up</span> <span data-start="151.669" data-end="153.169">telling the standards body as wow it's</span> <span data-start="153.169" data-end="153.98">it's kind of a hue</span> <span data-start="153.98" data-end="156.019">mess and it solves half your problems</span> <span data-start="156.019" data-end="158.87">and half the time I mean indexdb is kind</span> <span data-start="158.87" data-end="160.22">of the quintessential example of huge</span> <span data-start="160.22" data-end="162.409">mess but this is just a general issue</span> <span data-start="162.409" data-end="165.83">with most the api's today and yet</span> <span data-start="165.83" data-end="167.87">despite all of this like somehow as a</span> <span data-start="167.87" data-end="170.599">platform we've we've done just okay I</span> <span data-start="170.599" data-end="173.36">mean well okay maybe better than okay</span> <span data-start="173.36" data-end="174.89">maybe we're the most successful platform</span> <span data-start="174.89" data-end="178.7">ever how did we manage to do that well</span> <span data-start="178.7" data-end="180.379">there's a few few techniques that we've</span> <span data-start="180.379" data-end="184.31">used as a community we've wrapped we've</span> <span data-start="184.31" data-end="187.069">said you know your API sucks let me</span> <span data-start="187.069" data-end="189.5">build a better one jquery is the most</span> <span data-start="189.5" data-end="191.209">famous example of this obviously but we</span> <span data-start="191.209" data-end="193.849">also do this amazing thing which was</span> <span data-start="193.849" data-end="196.43">called prolly filling we're saying</span> <span data-start="196.43" data-end="199.28">wouldn't it be cool if we could select</span> <span data-start="199.28" data-end="201.41">elements in the dom using CSS selectors</span> <span data-start="201.41" data-end="204.23">and the sizzle is born or wouldn't it be</span> <span data-start="204.23" data-end="206.9">cool if we could create custom tags that</span> <span data-start="206.9" data-end="208.4">have their own behaviors just like</span> <span data-start="208.4" data-end="210.17">normal HTML tags and thus something like</span> <span data-start="210.17" data-end="212.69">angularjs is born so these are these are</span> <span data-start="212.69" data-end="215.09">prolly fills right like a probably this</span> <span data-start="215.09" data-end="216.709">will fill in for the future of our</span> <span data-start="216.709" data-end="219.2">language and of our platform and</span> <span data-start="219.2" data-end="222.26">eventually they do but but sometimes</span> <span data-start="222.26" data-end="223.669">that isn't enough sometimes we need to</span> <span data-start="223.669" data-end="225.68">transpile write our language itself</span> <span data-start="225.68" data-end="228.139">fails us so we create things like SAS</span> <span data-start="228.139" data-end="230.959">well i'm with which extend CSS with some</span> <span data-start="230.959" data-end="232.72">pretty darn obvious features or</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="232.72" data-end="234.62">CoffeeScript it just gives us a more</span> <span data-start="234.62" data-end="237.47">expressive language to work in these</span> <span data-start="237.47" data-end="239.63">have their problems but but in the end</span> <span data-start="239.63" data-end="241.849">they helped us a lot towards a more</span> <span data-start="241.849" data-end="244.34">expressive platform finally in one case</span> <span data-start="244.34" data-end="245.84">that's particularly close to my heart</span> <span data-start="245.84" data-end="248.03">you know we even built an interoperable</span> <span data-start="248.03" data-end="249.62">standard among a bunch of implementers</span> <span data-start="249.62" data-end="252.019">of a certain pattern promises from the</span> <span data-start="252.019" data-end="254.989">ground up but I mean in general for all</span> <span data-start="254.989" data-end="257.329">of these things that we do we say we do</span> <span data-start="257.329" data-end="258.799">them because we need our platform to be</span> <span data-start="258.799" data-end="260.87">better and so we need to make it better</span> <span data-start="260.87" data-end="264.08">ourselves so the extensible web</span> <span data-start="264.08" data-end="266.12">manifesto is this thing we put together</span> <span data-start="266.12" data-end="269.33">a few months ago saying that the</span> <span data-start="269.33" data-end="272.09">standards bodies are really ready to do</span> <span data-start="272.09" data-end="273.8">their part in this this game that's</span> <span data-start="273.8" data-end="276.08">platform that we're trying to create you</span> <span data-start="276.08" data-end="277.76">know until now we as the community have</span> <span data-start="277.76" data-end="279.26">been shouldering all the work we've been</span> <span data-start="279.26" data-end="281.06">writing our massive JavaScript libraries</span> <span data-start="281.06" data-end="283.729">or trans piling just to reinvent basic</span> <span data-start="283.729" data-end="285.11">functionality and get</span> <span data-start="285.11" data-end="287.54">we want but there's a better way where</span> <span data-start="287.54" data-end="289.64">we work together with these these bodies</span> <span data-start="289.64" data-end="291.14">and these implementers towards the</span> <span data-start="291.14" data-end="293.96">future and so you know well one way of</span> <span data-start="293.96" data-end="295.61">putting this you know a good analogy I</span> <span data-start="295.61" data-end="297.11">think is what the standards bodies have</span> <span data-start="297.11" data-end="299.33">realized is that the web platform is our</span> <span data-start="299.33" data-end="301.88">language but like all languages it must</span> <span data-start="301.88" data-end="304.58">evolve and there's two ways that this</span> <span data-start="304.58" data-end="306.95">primarily happens two ways in which we</span> <span data-start="306.95" data-end="310.13">extend the web forward as we say so we</span> <span data-start="310.13" data-end="312.47">need to extend our basic vocabulary our</span> <span data-start="312.47" data-end="315.26">basic pieces of this language and the</span> <span data-start="315.26" data-end="316.4">second part is we need to start</span> <span data-start="316.4" data-end="318.74">incorporating slang I want to go over</span> <span data-start="318.74" data-end="320.48">some of the things like what does this</span> <span data-start="320.48" data-end="323">mean when I say extending our vocabulary</span> <span data-start="323" data-end="325.7">there's really two key ideas here first</span> <span data-start="325.7" data-end="327.83">we need to explain the features of the</span> <span data-start="327.83" data-end="331.04">platform that are already there so you</span> <span data-start="331.04" data-end="332.57">know going back to the language analogy</span> <span data-start="332.57" data-end="334.52">wouldn't it be weird if we had these</span> <span data-start="334.52" data-end="337.19">compound words like sci-fi but we didn't</span> <span data-start="337.19" data-end="339.02">actually have words for science or</span> <span data-start="339.02" data-end="341.63">fiction well that's that's kind of how</span> <span data-start="341.63" data-end="343.34">it is on the web today if some standards</span> <span data-start="343.34" data-end="345.5">body maybe the the French making up</span> <span data-start="345.5" data-end="348.14">words rolled wide consortium just handed</span> <span data-start="348.14" data-end="350">us the word like sandpaper but we never</span> <span data-start="350" data-end="351.97">actually had a word for sand or paper</span> <span data-start="351.97" data-end="354.35">individually that's that's the problem</span> <span data-start="354.35" data-end="355.79">we face today where we have these high</span> <span data-start="355.79" data-end="357.35">level features but they're not built</span> <span data-start="357.35" data-end="358.73">from anything that we could actually</span> <span data-start="358.73" data-end="361.46">reuse and create new words out of create</span> <span data-start="361.46" data-end="364.25">new new things out of we just have all</span> <span data-start="364.25" data-end="368.12">this magic compound concepts in the</span> <span data-start="368.12" data-end="369.95">second part of extending our vocabulary</span> <span data-start="369.95" data-end="371.36">is giving you new low-level features</span> <span data-start="371.36" data-end="373.34">that you can use right if you wanted to</span> <span data-start="373.34" data-end="375.47">invent the word sci-fi somebody better</span> <span data-start="375.47" data-end="376.76">have come up with the concepts of</span> <span data-start="376.76" data-end="379.88">science and fiction first right and just</span> <span data-start="379.88" data-end="381.74">like that on the web there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="381.74" data-end="383.51">things we just don't have words for and</span> <span data-start="383.51" data-end="385.64">we're slowly getting there but still</span> <span data-start="385.64" data-end="388.04">native apps are hurting us here they're</span> <span data-start="388.04" data-end="389.42">saying we have the ability to access</span> <span data-start="389.42" data-end="391.61">this device feature we can do the</span> <span data-start="391.61" data-end="394.43">clipboard but you can't so we need to</span> <span data-start="394.43" data-end="396.68">extend our platform in a way that's that</span> <span data-start="396.68" data-end="399.29">takes these into account so with this in</span> <span data-start="399.29" data-end="400.64">mind like what are what kind of</span> <span data-start="400.64" data-end="403.19">initiatives are underway to give us this</span> <span data-start="403.19" data-end="404.93">this new vocabulary this new feature of</span> <span data-start="404.93" data-end="407.15">the web platform what has the extensible</span> <span data-start="407.15" data-end="409.31">web philosophy kind of yielded and what</span> <span data-start="409.31" data-end="411.44">can you look forward to well well first</span> <span data-start="411.44" data-end="413.03">one the most fundamental gap in the</span> <span data-start="413.03" data-end="415.64">platform i think is is how these darn</span> <span data-start="415.64" data-end="416.889">tag things work</span> <span data-start="416.889" data-end="419.229">and custom tags is a feature that tries</span> <span data-start="419.229" data-end="421.15">to explain that because think about it</span> <span data-start="421.15" data-end="423.61">right now you feed a string painting</span> <span data-start="423.61" data-end="425.919">some angle brackets into the browser and</span> <span data-start="425.919" data-end="427.509">then they get turned into these</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.509" data-end="429.249">JavaScript objects with these wonderful</span> <span data-start="429.249" data-end="431.919">api's and we call that the Dom how does</span> <span data-start="431.919" data-end="434.199">that even work right like what what what</span> <span data-start="434.199" data-end="437.199">tags how do they work we'll custom tags</span> <span data-start="437.199" data-end="438.729">explain this process they say you</span> <span data-start="438.729" data-end="442.509">register the mapping of tag names to</span> <span data-start="442.509" data-end="444.189">element prototypes with the browser and</span> <span data-start="444.189" data-end="446.02">then when the HTML parser gets its</span> <span data-start="446.02"

data-end="452.5">is great this is this is the</span> <span data-start="452.5" data-end="454.99">democratization of HTML essentially this</span> <span data-start="454.99" data-end="457">is saying that you are now on the same</span> <span data-start="457" data-end="458.56">level as browser vendors when you want</span> <span data-start="458.56" data-end="460.93">to create new semantics and new widgets</span> <span data-start="460.93" data-end="463.15">for your web and what's even great</span> <span data-start="463.15" data-end="465.31">better about this right is you have no</span> <span

tags and they</span> <span data-start="487.75" data-end="489.669">turn into elements and they behave like</span> <span data-start="489.669" data-end="491.169">normal Dom things with getters and</span>

data-end="1376.9">from this technical architecture group</span> <span data-start="1376.9" data-end="1379.059">overhaul they've given some really great</span> <span data-start="1379.059"

data-end="1432.28">standards is something I've been diving</span> <span data-start="1432.28" data-end="1434.14">into over the last half year or so it</span> <span data-start="1434.14" data-end="1436.51">started with my promises work but it's</span> <span data-start="1436.51" data-end="1438.85">expanded into many other things you know</span> <span data-start="1438.85" data-end="1440.32">finding the right approach is delicate</span> <span data-start="1440.32" data-end="1441.82">right these people are very used to you</span> <span data-start="1441.82" data-end="1442.96">coming onto their mailing list and</span> <span data-start="1442.96" data-end="1445.12">saying let's add a radar prototype top</span> <span data-start="1445.12" data-end="1447.61">my favorite thing and then there that</span> <span data-start="1447.61" data-end="1449.35">you just flip the bozo a bit and and</span> <span data-start="1449.35"

data-end="1454.21">but if you if you kind of approach in</span> <span data-start="1454.21" data-end="1456.67">good faith and have a use case and don't</span> <span data-start="1456.67" data-end="1458.47">have a prideful demeanor they're really</span> <span data-start="1458.47" data-end="1460.48">happy to listen and I've had a few</span> <span data-start="1460.48" data-end="1461.86">success stories where I've kind of</span> <span data-start="1461.86" data-end="1463.87">talked other developers through how do</span> <span data-start="1463.87" data-end="1465.04">you know what's a good way to approach</span> <span data-start="1465.04" data-end="1467.35">this this problem and how should you</span> <span data-start="1467.35" data-end="1469.15">talk to and and what channel should you</span> <span data-start="1469.15" data-end="1472.3">use in this area already and and by this</span> <span data-start="1472.3" data-end="1474.28">time next year I'd love to have a lot</span> <span data-start="1474.28" data-end="1476.98">more and i'll be giving a talk at lxj</span> <span data-start="1476.98"

data-end="1483.49">exact process so I finally I want to end</span> <span data-start="1483.49" data-end="1485.38">on a hopeful note right because it's</span> <span data-start="1485.38" data-end="1486.61">easy to think about all these cool</span> <span data-start="1486.61" data-end="1487.96">things that I showed you earlier and all</span> <span data-start="1487.96"

data-end="1499.66">that's really not so bad when you</span> <span data-start="1499.66" data-end="1501.309">consider the alternative this is the</span> <span data-start="1501.309" data-end="1504.19">price we pay for the open extensible</span> <span data-start="1504.19" data-end="1506.83">multi-platform web as opposed to</span> <span data-start="1506.83"
