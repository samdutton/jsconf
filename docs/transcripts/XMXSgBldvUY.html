data-end="8.01">happen on black friday so thankfully</span> <span data-start="8.01" data-end="13.349">this this talk is a bit more positive</span> <span data-start="13.349" data-end="16.289">than it could have otherwise been this</span> <span data-start="16.289" data-end="17.22">very much could have been a disaster</span> <span data-start="17.22" data-end="19.65">porn segment but that's not the way it</span> <span data-start="19.65" data-end="24.48">went thankfully so this is a second year</span> <span data-start="24.48" data-end="28.609">that we've done a note BF sort of</span> <span data-start="28.609" data-end="33.57">twitter campaign and basically we just</span> <span data-start="33.57" data-end="36.03">documented what what happened in our</span> <span data-start="36.03" data-end="39.66">system as we hit the most traffic that</span> <span data-start="39.66" data-end="43.5">we see throughout the year and this year</span> <span data-start="43.5" data-end="46.559">was fairly unique for myself because it</span> <span data-start="46.559" data-end="49.14">was the first year that we were doing</span> <span data-start="49.14" data-end="51.51">some fairly intensive cpu tasks within</span> <span data-start="51.51" data-end="55.05">our note environment last year we were</span> <span data-start="55.05" data-end="58.079">basically just concatenate ingela script</span> <span data-start="58.079" data-end="60.75">or sorry concatenate HTML with a little</span> <span data-start="60.75" data-end="62.879">bit of minimal JavaScript and pushing</span> <span data-start="62.879" data-end="65.01">out to the client that lightweight super</span> <span data-start="65.01" data-end="69.21">simple easy this year to try to improve</span> <span data-start="69.21" data-end="71.25">our initial page load performance as</span> <span data-start="71.25" data-end="74.369">well as our SEO we've updated a number</span> <span data-start="74.369" data-end="77.85">of our pages to render the content on</span> <span data-start="77.85" data-end="79.229">the server and then push it down to the</span> <span data-start="79.229" data-end="82.17">client so it this provides a much faster</span> <span data-start="82.17" data-end="85.56">page load I can show you some nice side</span> <span data-start="85.56" data-end="87.75">by side videos that really drive home</span> <span data-start="87.75" data-end="89.909">the point but I don't really have time</span> <span data-start="89.909" data-end="93.86">for that today or in this presentation</span> <span data-start="93.86" data-end="96.659">the the issue that this brings up is</span> <span data-start="96.659" data-end="101.28">that it's a massively different of load</span> <span data-start="101.28" data-end="104.13">on the servers its CPU versus i/o bound</span> <span data-start="104.13" data-end="108.479">and notice awesome at a thai oh wait</span> <span data-start="108.479" data-end="112.47">sorts of tasks but cpu-bound operations</span> <span data-start="112.47" data-end="115.46">using having only one thread available</span> <span data-start="115.46" data-end="119.13">can quickly smile spiral out of control</span> <span data-start="119.13" data-end="121.649">if you don't have the proper</span> <span data-start="121.649" data-end="126.659">configuration and safety mechanisms so</span> <span data-start="126.659" data-end="130.349">this is kind of what I had thought that</span> <span data-start="130.349" data-end="132.36">black friday would be and it certainly</span> <span data-start="132.36" data-end="133.63">was in the</span> <span data-start="133.63" data-end="135.16">the couple of months prior to black</span> <span data-start="135.16" data-end="139.3">friday but we actually effectively</span> <span data-start="139.3" data-end="142.33">repeated last year this is a graph of</span> <span data-start="142.33" data-end="147.49">our I believe this is the RSS loads on</span> <span data-start="147.49" data-end="150.43">the servers and they're basically flat</span> <span data-start="150.43" data-end="153.61">there's the servers were at least on</span> <span data-start="153.61" data-end="155.89">this particular metric not doing a whole</span> <span data-start="155.89" data-end="160.03">lot this is obviously a bit contrived</span> <span data-start="160.03" data-end="161.92">because the CPU is we're doing a lot of</span> <span data-start="161.92" data-end="163.54">things as well but those graphs aren't</span> <span data-start="163.54" data-end="165.58">nearly as interesting and don't drive</span> <span data-start="165.58" data-end="170.32">the point home but to do all this it</span> <span data-start="170.32" data-end="174.07">took a lot of work to to get our system</span> <span data-start="174.07" data-end="175.75">into this state that we needed it to be</span> <span data-start="175.75" data-end="179.16">when we first started deploying this</span> <span data-start="179.16" data-end="183.31">everything seemed fine under our smaller</span> <span data-start="183.31" data-end="185.35">production loads but we quickly found</span> <span data-start="185.35" data-end="190.96">that I got our first stress test we</span> <span data-start="190.96" data-end="192.64">couldn't even deliver half of the</span> <span data-start="192.64" data-end="195.28">traffic that we did last year due to</span> <span data-start="195.28" data-end="197.32">these changes and due to implementing</span> <span data-start="197.32" data-end="202.09">them in some pathological ways which was</span> <span data-start="202.09" data-end="204.28">not good needed to say there were some</span> <span data-start="204.28" data-end="206.11">concerned people in the business group</span> <span data-start="206.11" data-end="211.96">after those results but basically we</span> <span data-start="211.96" data-end="215.53">used those stress tests as well as some</span> <span data-start="215.53" data-end="217.84">pretty aggressive monitoring both during</span> <span data-start="217.84" data-end="220.23">those tests and throughout the year to</span> <span data-start="220.23" data-end="223.03">identify issues that we may have run</span> <span data-start="223.03" data-end="226.54">into between memory leaks excess of CPU</span> <span data-start="226.54" data-end="228.37">and those sorts of things and we flicked</span> <span data-start="228.37" data-end="231.04">them fix them as quickly as we could and</span> <span data-start="231.04" data-end="234.61">push the production and moved on to the</span> <span data-start="234.61" data-end="238.87">next issue which this was very helpful</span> <span data-start="238.87" data-end="245.95">we survived so I there's three big</span> <span data-start="245.95" data-end="248.709">changes that we made that helped us out</span> <span data-start="248.709" data-end="252.76">the most and in our opinion the first of</span> <span data-start="252.76" data-end="258.58">those was the event loop effectively we</span> <span data-start="258.58" data-end="260.47">were taking a system that was designed</span> <span data-start="260.47" data-end="263.979">to generate HTML on a within a browser</span> <span data-start="263.979" data-end="266.66">on the user's device</span> <span data-start="266.66" data-end="270.8">and trying to make it work under a note</span> <span data-start="270.8" data-end="273.44">environment that has very different</span> <span data-start="273.44" data-end="275.75">goals on the user's device you may want</span> <span data-start="275.75" data-end="278.66">to show partial behavior earlier or you</span> <span data-start="278.66" data-end="281.39">may want to delay the actual you may</span> <span data-start="281.39" data-end="284.15">want to run on the event loop longer in</span> <span data-start="284.15" data-end="287.9">order to show everything at the proper</span> <span data-start="287.9" data-end="290.3">time to the user and in some cases avoid</span> <span data-start="290.3" data-end="295.58">browser bugs but this led to situations</span> <span data-start="295.58" data-end="297.98">where you'd have 40 milliseconds to</span> <span data-start="297.98" data-end="301.93">render a page and that's continuous so</span> <span data-start="301.93" data-end="304.04">rendering a single page would be 40</span> <span data-start="304.04" data-end="305.66">milliseconds sitting on the event loop</span> <span data-start="305.66" data-end="310.19">and under under small loads that's not</span> <span data-start="310.19" data-end="312.4">an issue but when you start throwing</span> <span data-start="312.4" data-end="316.85">tons of crazed shoppers at the system it</span> <span data-start="316.85" data-end="319.97">very quickly destabilize this a system</span> <span data-start="319.97" data-end="322.37">and when you're in a situation that you</span> <span data-start="322.37" data-end="325.79">have event loop contention on your node</span> <span data-start="325.79" data-end="328.22">server it you can take down the entire</span> <span data-start="328.22" data-end="330.32">thing very easily it's not just that</span> <span data-start="330.32" data-end="333.41">only those routes are destabilized it's</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="335.87">everything so with that ties that's</span> <span data-start="335.87" data-end="337.46">basically the behavior that we saw in</span> <span data-start="337.46" data-end="341.66">our first stress test the the entire</span> <span data-start="341.66" data-end="345.23">server went down not just the the pages</span> <span data-start="345.23" data-end="348.14">that were in question here and that's</span> <span data-start="348.14" data-end="357.86">very bad so additionally we since we had</span> <span data-start="357.86" data-end="360.65">the client side rendering path that we</span> <span data-start="360.65" data-end="362.12">had to use previous years and we knew</span> <span data-start="362.12" data-end="365.54">that that worked we were able to utilize</span> <span data-start="365.54" data-end="370.88">this to failover at the at the proper</span> <span data-start="370.88" data-end="373.22">port failover if the system determined</span> <span data-start="373.22" data-end="378.08">that it was likely to hit a case where</span> <span data-start="378.08" data-end="380.06">there would be contention or just</span> <span data-start="380.06" data-end="384.53">general stress we also designed this so</span> <span data-start="384.53" data-end="387.02">that it would be automatic the point</span> <span data-start="387.02" data-end="389.6">that you're starting to have or that the</span> <span data-start="389.6" data-end="391.31">point that human could react to having</span> <span data-start="391.31" data-end="394.07">been notified by a system that email or</span> <span data-start="394.07" data-end="396.289">pager or whatever the case may be your</span> <span data-start="396.289" data-end="398.57">systems already highly unstable at that</span> <span data-start="398.57" data-end="399.249">point</span> <span data-start="399.249" data-end="402.789">and you may even depend on exactly how</span> <span data-start="402.789" data-end="405.069">its implemented if it's a wife config</span> <span data-start="405.069" data-end="408.879">push you may not be able to even talk to</span> <span data-start="408.879" data-end="413.049">the endpoints in question and restarting</span> <span data-start="413.049" data-end="414.939">servers that are already under that sort</span> <span data-start="414.939" data-end="417.279">of load can also lead to some very bad</span> <span data-start="417.279" data-end="421.299">things so you absolutely want to make</span> <span data-start="421.299" data-end="422.919">sure that if you are doing any sort of</span> <span data-start="422.919" data-end="428.019">failover it happens automatically we</span> <span data-start="428.019" data-end="431.459">also designed the system so that it was</span> <span data-start="431.459" data-end="434.499">targeted at the public use case at the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.499" data-end="438.789">Googlebot at the basically at the point</span> <span data-start="438.789" data-end="440.919">that we can serve only the content to</span> <span data-start="440.919" data-end="444.429">the user that or sorry that the initial</span> <span data-start="444.429" data-end="447.129">response is only the content that is</span> <span data-start="447.129" data-end="450.819">long-lived and applies to everyone so we</span> <span data-start="450.819" data-end="452.619">split out services that would either</span> <span data-start="452.619" data-end="457.179">user specific or have data that needs to</span> <span data-start="457.179" data-end="459.459">be shorter-lived due to whatever reason</span> <span data-start="459.459" data-end="462.459">and then we pushed all this into a large</span> <span data-start="462.459" data-end="464.439">number of caches throughout the system</span> <span data-start="464.439" data-end="470.229">and found that your use case will vary</span> <span data-start="470.229" data-end="473.019">but they're having offload in a system</span> <span data-start="473.019" data-end="478.509">like this is quite important so we did</span> <span data-start="478.509" data-end="481.179">all these but there was certainly a</span> <span data-start="481.179" data-end="483.549">varied amount of impact based off of</span> <span data-start="483.549" data-end="488.529">what the based off of each different</span> <span data-start="488.529" data-end="492.369">action that we took so the event loop</span> <span data-start="492.369" data-end="495.339">was very important so was the event loop</span> <span data-start="495.339" data-end="501.099">and the event loop this change added a</span> <span data-start="501.099" data-end="502.989">lot of complexity or to our code because</span> <span data-start="502.989" data-end="506.079">we needed to support rendering</span> <span data-start="506.079" data-end="507.599">synchronously on the client and</span> <span data-start="507.599" data-end="511.119">asynchronously on the server but it had</span> <span data-start="511.119" data-end="513.279">we not made these changes I don't think</span> <span data-start="513.279" data-end="515.039">that we would have survived the holiday</span> <span data-start="515.039" data-end="519.519">or we would have had to turn things off</span> <span data-start="519.519" data-end="522.129">and toned it down gone back to the older</span> <span data-start="522.129" data-end="524.35">system or other sorts of mitigation</span> <span data-start="524.35" data-end="529.54">techniques but the failover and the</span> <span data-start="529.54" data-end="532.269">caching actually didn't matter that much</span> <span data-start="532.269" data-end="535.69">for</span> <span data-start="535.7" data-end="538.38">of course that did not work on this</span> <span data-start="538.38" data-end="545.43">resolution so this is a graph of all the</span> <span data-start="545.43" data-end="549.42">server side does execution instances of</span> <span data-start="549.42" data-end="555.51">over I believe that nature there we</span> <span data-start="555.51" data-end="558.45">found that almost no failover occurred</span> <span data-start="558.45" data-end="560.25">there were some errors down at the</span> <span data-start="560.25"
