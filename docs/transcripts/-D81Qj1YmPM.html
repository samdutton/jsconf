data-end="61.17">you've probably seen talks before about</span> <span data-start="61.17" data-end="64.739">performance and you know we kind of hear</span> <span data-start="64.739" data-end="66.119">the same things time and time again so I</span> <span data-start="66.119" data-end="67.95">wanted to cover kind of what those</span> <span data-start="67.95" data-end="71.939">things

data-end="127.86">use for your business definitely but it</span> <span data-start="127.86" data-end="129.66">definitely works for amazon so maybe if</span> <span data-start="129.66"

it's it's abstract so it doesn't</span> <span data-start="218.17" data-end="221.29">really matter but from 2010 until 2014</span> <span data-start="221.29" data-end="223.18">response size grew by two and a half</span> <span data-start="223.18" data-end="225.37">times so your average response side this</span> <span data-start="225.37" data-end="228.67">is taken from the HTTP archive grew from</span> <span data-start="228.67" data-end="232.36">about 700 k to somewhere like the 1800</span> <span data-start="232.36" data-end="235.39">ish be on there and that's that's pretty</span> <span
