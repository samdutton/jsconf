CSS pranks J's Kampf I know</span> <span data-start="18.93" data-end="21.81">but CSS pranks you used to I don't even</span> <span data-start="21.81" data-end="22.859">know if I'll need the whole five minutes</span> <span data-start="22.859" data-end="25.5">here they used to be a really cool way</span> <span data-start="25.5" data-end="26.699">that you could do this in Chrome there</span> <span data-start="26.699" data-end="28.65">was a file called custom CSS and if you</span> <span data-start="28.65" data-end="31.38">open that file and you put CSS in it it</span> <span data-start="31.38" data-end="33.03">would apply that CSS to every single</span> <span data-start="33.03" data-end="35.16">website that this person went to which</span> <span data-start="35.16" data-end="36.48">was an awesome way to just kind of mess</span> <span data-start="36.48" data-end="38.43">with them and mangle with them but that</span> <span data-start="38.43" data-end="41.579">was eventually deprecated but you can</span> <span data-start="41.579" data-end="43.32">now pretty much build a small extension</span> <span data-start="43.32" data-end="45.539">add to CSS into it install the extension</span> <span data-start="45.539" data-end="46.95">on anybody who's really kind of</span> <span data-start="46.95" data-end="48.69">unsuspecting and if they've just left</span> <span data-start="48.69" data-end="50.129">that computer open you can kind of do</span> <span data-start="50.129" data-end="52.829">that it used to be funnier because in</span> <span data-start="52.829" data-end="54.39">custom CSS it would apply to all the</span> <span data-start="54.39" data-end="56.76">settings and everything like that in the</span> <span data-start="56.76" data-end="57.87">browser so sometimes it was really</span> <span data-start="57.87" data-end="60.84">confusing to kind of turn things off but</span> <span data-start="60.84" data-end="62.34">yeah so once you kind of enter this</span> <span data-start="62.34" data-end="63.84">point where you can enter CSS into</span> <span data-start="63.84" data-end="65.28">anybody's page you can really start to</span> <span data-start="65.28" data-end="67.74">kind of mess with some people so here's</span> <span data-start="67.74" data-end="69.84">a really really simple example if you</span> <span data-start="69.84" data-end="72.06">put grayscale 100% on everything</span> <span data-start="72.06" data-end="73.979">everybody's websites are gonna be black</span> <span data-start="73.979" data-end="76.14">and white and it's just every single</span> <span data-start="76.14" data-end="78.09">thing you're looking at Google Images</span> <span data-start="78.09" data-end="79.29">anything like that it's black and white</span> <span data-start="79.29" data-end="81.27">and the key I think to messing with</span> <span data-start="81.27" data-end="85.83">people is subtle fuckery rather than</span> <span data-start="85.83" data-end="90.03">full-blown unusable 'ti if you rotate</span> <span data-start="90.03" data-end="92.88">the page just by a tiny tiny amount it's</span> <span data-start="92.88" data-end="94.35">gonna look normal at the start this is</span> <span data-start="94.35" data-end="95.759">my old website but as they start to</span> <span data-start="95.759" data-end="97.829">scroll down it's gonna start to get</span> <span data-start="97.829" data-end="99.9">weirder and weirder where here's my my</span> <span data-start="99.9" data-end="104.159">current website for example you can do</span> <span data-start="104.159" data-end="105.42">that to every single website that</span> <span data-start="105.42" data-end="107.759">somebody visits and they're just I guess</span> <span data-start="107.759" data-end="109.049">you just gotta kind of start to tilt</span> <span data-start="109.049" data-end="112.14">your head something like that this is</span> <span data-start="112.14" data-end="114.119">another kind of funny one is it's kind</span> <span data-start="114.119" data-end="116.1">of trying to take advantage of class</span> <span data-start="116.1" data-end="117.63">names that are used by a lot of websites</span> <span data-start="117.63" data-end="119.939">so here's a keyframe animation that will</span> <span data-start="119.939"
