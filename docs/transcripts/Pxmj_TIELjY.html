data-end="1123.3">in the view you'll loop through all the</span> <span data-start="1123.3" data-end="1125.07">to do's and you'll spit them in the page</span> <span data-start="1125.07" data-end="1127.8">with the template the real interesting</span> <span data-start="1127.8" data-end="1131.22">part is is this little bit yeah by</span> <span data-start="1131.22" data-end="1132.87">inserting something that's not a string</span> <span data-start="1132.87" data-end="1135.84">it knows to put that in the jQuery data</span> <span data-start="1135.84" data-end="1137.82">so that it later there it's really easy</span> <span data-start="1137.82" data-end="1139.2">to look up so when it comes time to</span> <span data-start="1139.2" data-end="1144.93">delete a single element right we listen</span> <span data-start="1144.93" data-end="1148.23">to delete click when that happens we</span> <span data-start="1148.23" data-end="1150.66">just basically go up one element to our</span> <span data-start="1150.66" data-end="1153.15">div and then we can get our model really</span> <span data-start="1153.15" data-end="1155.04">easy and then call destroy on that model</span> <span data-start="1155.04" data-end="1157.95">it's like that easy right it's it's</span> <span data-start="1157.95" data-end="1160.47">really simple so then because we use</span> <span data-start="1160.47" data-end="1163.98">open Ajax like published messages that</span> <span data-start="1163.98" data-end="1165.09">are the result of all our service</span> <span data-start="1165.09" data-end="1167.34">requests we don't have to if we had</span> <span data-start="1167.34" data-end="1169.05">multiple of these to do which it's on</span> <span data-start="1169.05" data-end="1171.3">the page and you delete one to do that</span> <span data-start="1171.3" data-end="1172.71">was shown another place while you just</span> <span data-start="1172.71" data-end="1174.84">subscribe to the delete of that to do</span> <span data-start="1174.84" data-end="1176.88">and it will remove itself automatically</span> <span data-start="1176.88" data-end="1179.28">all right there's just like little tions</span> <span data-start="1179.28" data-end="1181.59">that you're always constantly doing that</span> <span data-start="1181.59" data-end="1183.15">get handled because you're using this</span> <span data-start="1183.15" data-end="1186.27">a.m MVC approach all right so the next</span> <span data-start="1186.27" data-end="1188.31">thing is testing and this is really</span> <span data-start="1188.31" data-end="1190.23">really important and this is the coolest</span> <span data-start="1190.23" data-end="1191.58">thing I think to come out of the third</span> <span data-start="1191.58" data-end="1194.13">version of JavaScript MVC it's because</span> <span data-start="1194.13" data-end="1198.24">testing just sucks so bad right I look</span> <span data-start="1198.24" data-end="1201.66">is it noise selenium is awesome but it's</span> <span data-start="1201.66" data-end="1202.45">still</span> <span data-start="1202.45" data-end="1205.27">sucks so does all testing solutions</span> <span data-start="1205.27" data-end="1206.83">until now but you guys could say that my</span> <span data-start="1206.83" data-end="1210.43">sucks too so the problem with each</span> <span data-start="1210.43" data-end="1211.78">testing solution there's like three main</span> <span data-start="1211.78" data-end="1213.01">ways there's like a browser-based</span> <span data-start="1213.01" data-end="1216.43">testing which is like qunit and that is</span> <span data-start="1216.43" data-end="1219.01">really easy to write but it's manually</span> <span data-start="1219.01" data-end="1220.54">driven all right you got to stand there</span> <span data-start="1220.54" data-end="1221.92">and open each browser and test it</span> <span data-start="1221.92" data-end="1224.29">there's the simulated browser</span> <span data-start="1224.29" data-end="1226.39">environments like MJ s there's a bunch</span> <span data-start="1226.39" data-end="1227.86">of others those are really nice but</span> <span data-start="1227.86" data-end="1229.6">they're not really high fidelity because</span> <span data-start="1229.6" data-end="1231.43">it's not the real browser running but</span> <span data-start="1231.43" data-end="1233.77">it's fast so you can get like good gut</span> <span data-start="1233.77" data-end="1235.54">check if your codes really working and</span> <span data-start="1235.54" data-end="1238">then there's the like selenium the</span> <span data-start="1238" data-end="1240.49">browser drivers these actually pop open</span> <span data-start="1240.49" data-end="1242.82">browsers and then run your tests on them</span> <span data-start="1242.82" data-end="1245.59">those do have high fidelity but the</span> <span data-start="1245.59" data-end="1248.2">problem is very hard to write like</span> <span data-start="1248.2" data-end="1249.52">they're hard to write tests kind of hard</span> <span data-start="1249.52" data-end="1250.9">to debug test because sometimes it</span> <span data-start="1250.9" data-end="1252.16">happened so fast you came and see what's</span> <span data-start="1252.16" data-end="1256">going on so it's really needed is it</span> <span data-start="1256" data-end="1259.21">tier 2 you had a question ok if there</span> <span data-start="1259.21" data-end="1260.17">anybody is a question just raise your</span> <span data-start="1260.17" data-end="1265.93">hand sorry I should I said every way so</span> <span data-start="1265.93" data-end="1267.28">what we mean is funk unit and it's</span> <span data-start="1267.28" data-end="1269.13">really a tiered approach it kind of has</span> <span data-start="1269.13" data-end="1273.22">all of these parts in it but a really</span> <span data-start="1273.22" data-end="1275.41">nice asynchronous syntax that you can</span> <span data-start="1275.41" data-end="1277.63">write one test and it runs in in the</span> <span data-start="1277.63" data-end="1279.61">browser it runs an end and it runs in</span> <span data-start="1279.61" data-end="1281.47">selenium so the syntax look something</span> <span data-start="1281.47" data-end="1284.71">like this it's based on cue units syntax</span> <span data-start="1284.71" data-end="1287.17">but it's also kind of based on jQuery</span> <span data-start="1287.17" data-end="1289.63">too so you basically select something</span> <span data-start="1289.63" data-end="1291.4">this would test like a numeric txt bak</span> <span data-start="1291.4" data-end="1294.09">you can only enter in numbers all right</span> <span data-start="1294.09" data-end="1296.29">look at it's pretty basic you click on</span> <span data-start="1296.29" data-end="1302.41">it you you type in 27 it doesn't write</span> <span data-start="1302.41" data-end="1303.91">anything like it should and then you</span> <span data-start="1303.91" data-end="1307.21">type 27 the numbers and it has 27 it's</span> <span data-start="1307.21" data-end="1309.64">really easy unfortunate fortunately we</span> <span data-start="1309.64" data-end="1311.65">were we had a great enough client who</span> <span data-start="1311.65" data-end="1316.81">let us show some example of this running</span> <span data-start="1316.81" data-end="1317.98">that if we just started working on this</span> <span data-start="1317.98" data-end="1322.75">prototype for them so it's running all</span> <span data-start="1322.75" data-end="1325.54">the tests in the browser so if you look</span> <span data-start="1325.54" data-end="1328.36">at the funk unit page okay so this is I</span> <span data-start="1328.36" data-end="1330.64">mean it is qunit it's just we've added</span> <span data-start="1330.64" data-end="1333.16">this ability to like drive another page</span> <span data-start="1333.16" data-end="1336.039">with qunit so you can open another page</span> <span data-start="1336.039" data-end="1338.44">then click on things really easy so okay</span> <span data-start="1338.44" data-end="1340.749">we looks like real quick at the code for</span> <span data-start="1340.749" data-end="1347.259">what that looks like so basic okay so</span> <span data-start="1347.259" data-end="1348.399">this is what the code for that looks</span> <span data-start="1348.399" data-end="1349.299">like just like what we're looking at</span> <span data-start="1349.299" data-end="1351.519">before right opens a page clicks on it</span> <span data-start="1351.519" data-end="1354.249">check something exists check something</span> <span data-start="1354.249" data-end="1356.47">else exists then gets a text for it they</span> <span data-start="1356.47" data-end="1357.759">say sit the reason why it's kind of like</span> <span data-start="1357.759" data-end="1359.049">a synchronous like this it handles</span> <span data-start="1359.049" data-end="1360.22">asynchronous behavior really well you</span> <span data-start="1360.22" data-end="1361.479">can call weights because it basically</span> <span data-start="1361.479" data-end="1363.22">compiles the list of commands is going</span> <span data-start="1363.22" data-end="1367.899">to make and then runs them so we can run</span> <span data-start="1367.899" data-end="1373.009">this in selenium really really easy so</span> <span data-start="1373.019" data-end="1375.249">just the script this automatically is</span> <span data-start="1375.249" data-end="1377.499">integrated with JavaScript MVC so this</span> <span data-start="1377.499" data-end="1379.629">is going to open up this will take a</span> <span data-start="1379.629" data-end="1381.7">second or two this is going to open up</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1381.7" data-end="1395.259">IE and then run those tests in IE so</span> <span data-start="1395.259" data-end="1397.269">this is all automated right so you can</span> <span data-start="1397.269" data-end="1399.609">actually just trigger a command and have</span> <span data-start="1399.609" data-end="1401.95">nightly builds run all this every night</span> <span data-start="1401.95" data-end="1404.169">but then be able but the awesome part</span> <span data-start="1404.169" data-end="1405.369">about it is I mean selenium can already</span> <span data-start="1405.369" data-end="1407.47">do this the awesome part is you can open</span> <span data-start="1407.47" data-end="1409.299">this up in your browser and debug it</span> <span data-start="1409.299" data-end="1412.69">right like you can you can have Firebug</span> <span data-start="1412.69" data-end="1414.399">hit an error and like see what the</span> <span data-start="1414.399" data-end="1417.309">heck's going on oh boy this is really</span> <span data-start="1417.309" data-end="1422.619">slow okay we can just it'll just show</span> <span data-start="1422.619" data-end="1426.509">some okays we could just cancel it then</span> <span data-start="1426.509" data-end="1428.679">yeah this is this is why i said it's</span> <span data-start="1428.679" data-end="1436.389">slow yeah so I should have mention that</span> <span data-start="1436.389" data-end="1437.71">every through this Third Point no</span> <span data-start="1437.71" data-end="1439.119">release it hasn't come out quite yet</span> <span data-start="1439.119" data-end="1440.32">we're trying to like the next week and a</span> <span

data-end="1445.45">everything some things obviously depend</span> <span data-start="1445.45" data-end="1447.549">on jQuery but phone Canyon won't depend</span> <span data-start="1447.549" data-end="1450.549">on jQuery and steel won't depend on</span> <span data-start="1450.549" data-end="1451.359">jQuery but we're trying to make</span> <span data-start="1451.359" data-end="1454.629">everything is useful as possible for as</span> <span data-start="1454.629" data-end="1457.539">many people as possible it's a hook so</span> <span data-start="1457.539" data-end="1461.59">eventually he'll okay so that's funk</span> <span data-start="1461.59" data-end="1464.289">unit damn it is just a javascript error</span> <span data-start="1464.289" data-end="1468.159">reporting service a real quick demo this</span> <span data-start="1468.159" data-end="1469.17">causes an error</span> <span data-start="1469.17" data-end="1471.45">cause an air this will this is just a</span> <span data-start="1471.45" data-end="1472.8">really simple script that you can clue</span> <span data-start="1472.8" data-end="1474.39">your pages that detect errors and then</span> <span data-start="1474.39" data-end="1477">send will email you when an error</span> <span data-start="1477" data-end="1479.16">happens or prompt the user to type in</span> <span data-start="1479.16" data-end="1483.84">what happened so so that just sent</span> <span data-start="1483.84" data-end="1485.91">there's just sentiment air and the</span> <span data-start="1485.91" data-end="1489.12">message so that's pretty nice you can</span> <span data-start="1489.12" data-end="1490.86">use this it's a it's an open source free</span> <span data-start="1490.86" data-end="1494.67">service document j/s there's been a lot</span> <span data-start="1494.67" data-end="1496.41">of awesome documentation engines coming</span> <span data-start="1496.41" data-end="1498.78">out recently ours is based on Remy</span> <span data-start="1498.78" data-end="1501.3">sharps it looks like really sharps you</span> <span data-start="1501.3" data-end="1504.14">document it with j s stock type stuff</span> <span data-start="1504.14" data-end="1509.58">looks like this you can search really</span> <span data-start="1509.58" data-end="1514.71">basic I don't it's nice okay go to the</span> <span data-start="1514.71" data-end="1518.25">next so then the final two pieces that</span> <span data-start="1518.25" data-end="1520.47">were kind of releasing back as a bunch</span> <span data-start="1520.47" data-end="1523.89">of jQuery extensions and widgets we wish</span> <span data-start="1523.89" data-end="1527.97">it so first the on widgets there's a</span> <span data-start="1527.97" data-end="1529.29">milk we're releasing a bunch of widgets</span> <span data-start="1529.29" data-end="1531.18">but they have like everybody's release</span> <span data-start="1531.18" data-end="1532.8">the same type of widgets over and over</span> <span data-start="1532.8" data-end="1533.88">and over again so what we're going to</span> <span data-start="1533.88" data-end="1538.08">try to do this is a an idea a lot from</span> <span data-start="1538.08" data-end="1540.99">yahoo de cats and ben almond i've talked</span> <span data-start="1540.99" data-end="1543.24">a lot about with this is a vent oriented</span> <span data-start="1543.24" data-end="1545.61">architecture for widgets so the idea is</span> <span data-start="1545.61" data-end="1548.07">what if your widgets were like the Dom</span> <span data-start="1548.07" data-end="1549.66">like the Dom actually provided like a</span> <span data-start="1549.66" data-end="1553.11">tab widget so the idea is like you could</span> <span data-start="1553.11" data-end="1558.99">click on a tab you click on the tab and</span> <span data-start="1558.99" data-end="1561.68">then it might trigger a hide request on</span> <span data-start="1561.68" data-end="1564.51">another div and then you can listen to</span> <span data-start="1564.51" data-end="1566.43">that and then prevent default prevent</span> <span data-start="1566.43" data-end="1569.25">the actual hiding of it and then if you</span> <span data-start="1569.25" data-end="1570.72">didn't it would call show and then you</span> <span data-start="1570.72" data-end="1572.94">could listen to show and do any complex</span> <span data-start="1572.94" data-end="1574.74">functionality you want the ideas we want</span> <span data-start="1574.74" data-end="1576.81">to provide a very small sub reusable</span> <span data-start="1576.81" data-end="1579.03">subset of like an event system for your</span> <span data-start="1579.03" data-end="1581.7">widgets and that you can add any crazy</span> <span data-start="1581.7" data-end="1583.71">custom functionality on you want on</span> <span data-start="1583.71" data-end="1585.15">because I feel a big problem with</span> <span data-start="1585.15" data-end="1586.92">current widget libraries is that they're</span> <span data-start="1586.92" data-end="1588.57">like monolithic they have to every</span> <span data-start="1588.57" data-end="1591.03">feature under the Sun because there's</span> <span data-start="1591.03" data-end="1593.22">not a great way always to like get in</span> <span data-start="1593.22" data-end="1595.8">there and make changes so this is fuii</span> <span data-start="1595.8" data-end="1598.41">we got like this is this is all</span> <span data-start="1598.41" data-end="1600.6">prototype right now this isn't like</span> <span data-start="1600.6" data-end="1601.89">coming out anytime</span> <span data-start="1601.89" data-end="1603.75">next week or so but you're really</span> <span data-start="1603.75" data-end="1605.85">interesting one I was taking some time</span> <span data-start="1605.85" data-end="1610.35">to load isn't it so we got a lot of</span> <span data-start="1610.35" data-end="1613.35">jQuery UI ones done but the interest</span> <span data-start="1613.35" data-end="1615.18">rate one is menu so just by this basic</span> <span data-start="1615.18" data-end="1617.67">menu right here we're able to add like a</span> <span data-start="1617.67" data-end="1619.98">lot of different type of crazy menus so</span> <span data-start="1619.98" data-end="1622.8">if you scroll down a navigation so this</span> <span data-start="1622.8" data-end="1626.7">is just that menu but we've mixed in a</span> <span data-start="1626.7" data-end="1629.04">shiftable class that listens to like</span> <span data-start="1629.04" data-end="1631.53">open and close and a fade in and fade</span> <span data-start="1631.53" data-end="1633.21">out a bowl class that that listens to</span> <span data-start="1633.21" data-end="1635.07">open and close so it allows you to like</span> <span data-start="1635.07" data-end="1636.84">mix in other things that with snow</span> <span data-start="1636.84" data-end="1641.19">events it's a crazy brainstorming idea</span> <span data-start="1641.19" data-end="1642.87">but with that same menu then we created</span> <span data-start="1642.87"
