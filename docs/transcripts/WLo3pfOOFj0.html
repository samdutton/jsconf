<p><span data-start="95.77" data-end="98.679">Dom API so for example if you wanted to</span> <span data-start="98.679" data-end="101.14">get content from these editors they give</span> <span

the methods that they gave you just</span> <span data-start="116.2" data-end="120.13">set the entire document so for at least</span> <span data-start="120.13" data-end="124.63">for our purposes you

data-start="132.12" data-end="134.92">and this kind of is a bigger problem</span> <span data-start="134.92" data-end="137.53">that the fact that it didn't have an API</span> <span data-start="137.53" data-end="140.47">means that kind of the the offerings out</span> <span data-start="140.47" data-end="142.58">there words</span> <span data-start="142.58" data-end="145.17">the offerings out there was

data-end="156">basically the imaginations of the people</span> <span data-start="156" data-end="158.97">that built those products so I we</span> <span data-start="158.97" data-end="161.28">started working on quill to solve that</span> <span data-start="161.28" data-end="164.88">problem and a key thing was that we</span> <span data-start="164.88" data-end="166.41">wanted a design quill so it could be a</span> <span data-start="166.41" data-end="168.63">drop-in replacement as a rich text</span> <span data-start="168.63" data-end="172.59">editor but it also needed feature needed</span> <span data-start="172.59" data-end="174.84">to feature an API that allowed you to</span> <span data-start="174.84" data-end="177.75">customize its behavior and allow you to</span> <span data-start="177.75" data-end="179.7">extend upon it so you could build</span> <span data-start="179.7" data-end="180.989">something that we didn't really think</span> <span data-start="180.989" data-end="186.9">about and so so that's what I'll talk</span> <span data-start="186.9" data-end="191.4">mostly about today so before I get</span> <span data-start="191.4" data-end="193.459">started and do demonstrations of the API</span> <span data-start="193.459" data-end="196.89">just the things that we want to keep in</span> <span data-start="196.89" data-end="199.079">mind when we were building it where we</span> <span data-start="199.079" data-end="201.66">wanted to be very simple that's</span> <span data-start="201.66" data-end="203.549">something of course desirable in any API</span> <span data-start="203.549" data-end="206.18">for a quill specifically it meant that</span> <span data-start="206.18" data-end="209.4">the content that you got the kind of the</span> <span data-start="209.4" data-end="211.47">data that you were working with was much</span> <span data-start="211.47" data-end="213.329">simpler than HTML if you had to start</span> <span data-start="213.329" data-end="215.819">parsing kind of start parsing the</span> <span data-start="215.819" data-end="217.53">content yourself then that's a</span> <span data-start="217.53" data-end="219.9">non-starter we wanted to be very</span> <span data-start="219.9" data-end="222.63">powerful which helps with the simplicity</span> <span data-start="222.63" data-end="224.4">because if you just do whatever you want</span> <span data-start="224.4" data-end="227.48">and then that's a very simple interface</span> <span data-start="227.48" data-end="230.22">but also for quote specifically that</span> <span data-start="230.22" data-end="232.049">means you should be able to change the</span> <span data-start="232.049" data-end="234">content whenever you want wherever you</span> <span data-start="234" data-end="236.04">want you could change a subset of the</span> <span data-start="236.04" data-end="238.17">document you could change any part of it</span> <span data-start="238.17" data-end="239.97">not just where the cursor is not just</span> <span data-start="239.97" data-end="243.06">the entire document and of course wanted</span> <span data-start="243.06" data-end="246.54">to be invented you vented because any</span> <span data-start="246.54" data-end="250.47">good API has events so I'm going to</span> <span data-start="250.47" data-end="257.099">switch to to quill to show you okay okay</span> <span data-start="257.099" data-end="263.039">that is ah crap okay see I kind of had a</span> <span data-start="263.039" data-end="267.3">feeling that where's my mom okay okay</span> <span data-start="267.3" data-end="269.099">had a feeling that would happen so I</span> <span data-start="269.099" data-end="278.93">have a backup okay</span> <span data-start="278.94" data-end="282.3">okay so basically it looks like a rich</span> <span data-start="282.3" data-end="285.51">text editor that you can type into it</span> <span data-start="285.51" data-end="288.45">you can apply formatting so it kind of</span> <span data-start="288.45" data-end="289.89">it does all the things that you want</span> <span data-start="289.89" data-end="292.5">from an editor but what we want to focus</span> <span data-start="292.5" data-end="295.85">more on is the API and basically I've</span> <span data-start="295.85" data-end="298.95">this is the documentation page for quill</span> <span data-start="298.95" data-end="303.66">quill jfcom and we've exposed a global</span> <span data-start="303.66" data-end="306.32">variable that you'd you can basically</span> <span data-start="306.32" data-end="309.33">try out any of these methods on the on</span> <span data-start="309.33" data-end="312.69">the main editor so before I do that I'll</span> <span data-start="312.69" data-end="315.6">just go over some of those some of those</span> <span data-start="315.6" data-end="320.4">methods okay and we're back to this okay</span> <span data-start="320.4" data-end="323.25">so first part retrieving the content so</span> <span data-start="323.25" data-end="324.81">like I said we don't want you to have to</span> <span data-start="324.81" data-end="328.35">deal with HTML so there's a few ways you</span> <span data-start="328.35" data-end="331.95">can get content there's get texts which</span> <span data-start="331.95" data-end="334.52">is just plain text via content which is</span> <span data-start="334.52" data-end="336.84">basically an array of the content that</span> <span data-start="336.84" data-end="339.69">i'll just show more in the demonstration</span> <span data-start="339.69" data-end="342.21">and then get selection where you can</span> <span data-start="342.21" data-end="344.24">basically this will return an index a</span> <span data-start="344.24" data-end="348.12">range that is an index into the editor</span> <span data-start="348.12" data-end="350.52">not if you're familiar with the Dom API</span> <span data-start="350.52" data-end="353.25">it would it would have given you an HTML</span> </p>

okay</span> <span data-start="783.01" data-end="786.04">so I guess well the part that I want to</span> <span data-start="786.04" data-end="788.26">focus on is you're probably all seen it</span> <span data-start="788.26" data-end="790.39">pretty much every editor has the same</span> <span data-start="790.39" data-end="792.73">link tool tip that allows you to edit</span> <span data-start="792.73" data-end="795.43">the link but here because you can</span> <span data-start="795.43" data-end="797.74">because you're the one that gets through</span> <span data-start="797.74" data-end="800.17">format the text and you don't have to</span> <span data-start="800.17" data-end="802.69">that means you can basically you're the</span> <span data-start="802.69" data-end="804.79">one that gets a set set it at the end</span> <span data-start="804.79" data-end="806.38">you don't have to use somebody else's</span> <span data-start="806.38" data-end="809.2">you can switch out the link tool tip and</span> <span data-start="809.2" data-end="810.91">use your own interface so for example</span> <span data-start="810.91" data-end="816.82">here maybe most of the time when you</span> <span data-start="816.82" data-end="818.47">when you're high when you're trying to</span> <span data-start="818.47" data-end="820.209">link something maybe you just want a</span> <span data-start="820.209" data-end="822.43">google search and a lot of times that's</span> <span data-start="822.43" data-end="824.649">what the link that you want or that's</span> <span data-start="824.649" data-end="827.44">the URL that you want so here this this</span> <span data-start="827.44" data-end="829.329">is kind of example of how you can modify</span> <span data-start="829.329" data-end="831.31">the behavior and modify the editing</span> <span data-start="831.31" data-end="833.32">experience that isn't necessarily bound</span> <span data-start="833.32" data-end="836.41">to what somebody else had decided was</span> <span data-start="836.41" data-end="838.93">the best wing tool tip and this may not</span> <span data-start="838.93" data-end="841.779">the i guess the point here isn't that</span> <span data-start="841.779" data-end="843.85">this is a better interface but the fact</span> <span data-start="843.85" data-end="846.279">is that you can because cool has an API</span> <span data-start="846.279" data-end="849.13">you can you can you can invent new</span> <span data-start="849.13" data-end="851.529">interfaces try those and if they may be</span> <span data-start="851.529" data-end="853.24">better than the ones that are already</span> <span data-start="853.24" data-end="855.49">provided so the point is that you can</span> <span data-start="855.49" data-end="857.019">extend this and you can change the</span> <span data-start="857.019" data-end="859.12">editing experience and you can push the</span> <span data-start="859.12" data-end="861.16">boundaries make better editing products</span> <span data-start="861.16" data-end="872.79">oh yeah I think okay so</span> <span data-start="872.8" data-end="875.48">okay so last thing I'll cover is events</span> <span data-start="875.48" data-end="877.7">basically there are two events you can</span> <span data-start="877.7" data-end="880.04">figure out when the selection change</span> <span data-start="880.04" data-end="885.82">happens or text change happens and I</span> <span data-start="885.82" data-end="905.98">will go back to Ashley okay</span> <span data-start="905.99" data-end="909.689">action</span> <span data-start="909.699" data-end="914.23">okay so this just registers a a handler</span> <span data-start="914.23" data-end="917.41">and now if I change the selection at all</span> <span data-start="917.41" data-end="918.85">it'll basically tell you that it's</span> <span data-start="918.85" data-end="920.829">changed when it's a cursor it's same</span> <span data-start="920.829" data-end="923.589">number and when it's different it gets</span> <span data-start="923.589" data-end="926.799">the whole gets the whole range and when</span> <span data-start="926.799" data-end="931.059">you lose focus it's no so so that</span> <span data-start="931.059" data-end="932.679">selection change text change is very</span> <span data-start="932.679" data-end="936.79">similar now I'll just go to the the last</span> <span data-start="936.79" data-end="940.6">demo which is which is actually one of</span> <span data-start="940.6" data-end="942.189">the my favorite use cases of quill</span> <span data-start="942.189" data-end="944.079">because it's kind of a use case that</span> <span data-start="944.079" data-end="946.54">which getting back to the reason why we</span> <span data-start="946.54" data-end="948.97">built it was it gets to something that</span> <span data-start="948.97" data-end="951.399">we didn't really think about when it</span> <span data-start="951.399" data-end="952.66">gets to an interface that we didn't</span> <span data-start="952.66" data-end="954.699">really think about when we were building</span> <span data-start="954.699" data-end="956.29">the editor at but because we made</span> <span data-start="956.29" data-end="958.419">extensible it's something that it was</span> <span data-start="958.419" data-end="960.819">able to be molded into that so there's</span> <span data-start="960.819" data-end="962.559">this interesting group at Stanford</span> <span data-start="962.559" data-end="965.819">that's doing doing some work on</span> <span data-start="965.819" data-end="968.069">translations it's kind of in the</span> <span data-start="968.069" data-end="970.779">interdisciplinary between the hard</span> <span data-start="970.779" data-end="973.919">science of translations but then also</span> <span data-start="973.919" data-end="978.309">user interfaces the kind of if you've</span> <span data-start="978.309" data-end="980.649">used translation services you know that</span> <span data-start="980.649" data-end="983.439">machines aren't perfect at it so you</span> <span data-start="983.439" data-end="985.239">kind of still you still need a human</span> <span data-start="985.239" data-end="987.549">involved so they're doing work to bridge</span> <span data-start="987.549" data-end="990.149">the gap between the two with from user</span> <span data-start="990.149" data-end="993.489">usability perspective so this is a demo</span> <span data-start="993.489" data-end="998.169">of what functionality that they built so</span> <span data-start="998.169" data-end="1000.539">immediately what it does is it's</span> <span data-start="1000.539" data-end="1001.799">essentially autocomplete for</span> <span data-start="1001.799" data-end="1005.369">translations so this is the text that a</span> <span data-start="1005.369" data-end="1006.839">translator would potentially have to</span> <span data-start="1006.839" data-end="1009.869">translate and here is the machines best</span> <span data-start="1009.869" data-end="1013.859">guess and so it's relatively good the</span> <span data-start="1013.859" data-end="1016.529">guesses are relatively good and but</span> <span data-start="1016.529" data-end="1018.149">sometimes when it's a little less sure</span> <span data-start="1018.149" data-end="1020.579">it'll present a few options and in this</span> <span data-start="1020.579" data-end="1022.98">case is not actually correct or this is</span> <span data-start="1022.98" data-end="1025.409">perhaps a better translation and then</span> <span data-start="1025.409" data-end="1030.149">you can kind of accept the rest so so</span> <span data-start="1030.149" data-end="1031.409">again that was something that we didn't</span> <span data-start="1031.409" data-end="1033.179">design for when we built quill we didn't</span> <span data-start="1033.179" data-end="1035.85">think about ways to improve the</span> <span data-start="1035.85" data-end="1037.529">experience for a translator but this</span> <span data-start="1037.529" data-end="1039.51">something that you could build and I</span> <span data-start="1039.51" data-end="1042.269">guess the point the main point of of</span> <span data-start="1042.269" data-end="1043.809">quill</span> <span data-start="1043.809" data-end="1046.209">is that is its API and it's able to do</span> <span data-start="1046.209" data-end="1049.21">this because it has one and so to</span> <span data-start="1049.21" data-end="1051.58">conclude I kind of want to step back</span> <span data-start="1051.58" data-end="1055.6">from quill specifically and talk about</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1055.6" data-end="1058.33">API is in general if you think about</span> <span data-start="1058.33" data-end="1060.759">products in everything as a graph then</span> <span data-start="1060.759" data-end="1062.799">if you just offer something without an</span> <span data-start="1062.799" data-end="1064.57">API it's essentially a terminal node</span> <span data-start="1064.57" data-end="1066.73">that's all you're going to get but if</span> <span data-start="1066.73" data-end="1069.22">you offer an API then it could be part</span> <span data-start="1069.22" data-end="1071.559">of a larger offering and it could spawn</span> <span data-start="1071.559" data-end="1073.21">many more products and many more ideas</span> <span data-start="1073.21" data-end="1076.119">so when you are building kind of those</span> <span data-start="1076.119" data-end="1078.46">products and services I encourage you to</span> <span data-start="1078.46" data-end="1080.559">think about that if you want if you want</span> <span data-start="1080.559" data-end="1083.649">your offering to be kind of that's all</span> <span data-start="1083.649" data-end="1086.2">the offering is or if you want to kind</span> <span data-start="1086.2" data-end="1088.029">of open the doors for something else</span> <span data-start="1088.029" data-end="1091.059">that you didn't think about so that's</span> </p>
