windows turned into a foundation</span> <span data-start="95.5" data-end="98.71">of a couple of javascript hackers that</span> <span data-start="98.71" data-end="101.32">had a unified vision for just

data-end="130.09">so the what dojo is has changed today is</span> <span data-start="130.09" data-end="132.9">in fact dojos five year anniversary</span> <span data-start="132.9" data-end="136.93">today was the first day that the net</span> <span data-start="136.93" data-end="139.45">windows mailing list email went out five</span> <span data-start="139.45" data-end="141.94">years ago so that's kind of significant</span> <span data-start="141.94" data-end="144.61">in that wow it's been that long that's</span> <span data-start="144.61" data-end="148.93">amazing so we became a JavaScript</span> <span data-start="148.93" data-end="150.91">toolkit we're not anything a framework</span> <span data-start="150.91" data-end="154.48">or anything beyond tools lightweight</span> <span data-start="154.48" data-end="158.05">base starts at typically 26 k it can get</span> <span data-start="158.05" data-end="162.01">down as small as 6 k and somewhere on 17</span> <span data-start="162.01" data-end="164.53">k is another another variant for web kit</span> <span data-start="164.53" data-end="167.65">which is i'll explain later we're</span> <span data-start="167.65" data-end="169.03">probably going to hover right around the</span> <span data-start="169.03" data-end="172.9">30k mark in 1.4 because of a project</span> <span data-start="172.9" data-end="175.51">that i also do called plug d probably</span> <span data-start="175.51" data-end="177.55">should be pronounced plugged</span> <span data-start="177.55" data-end="180.13">but I call it plug d because I refused</span> <span data-start="180.13" data-end="182.38">to follow conventions so it's it's just</span> <span data-start="182.38" data-end="184.03">a use it will library it starts with</span> <span data-start="184.03" data-end="185.68">this small base and then you get all of</span> <span data-start="185.68" data-end="188.55">these extra components right like it's</span> <span data-start="188.55" data-end="190.93">everyone's familiar with XKCD right</span> <span data-start="190.93" data-end="194.02">right so dojo is to javascript like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="194.02" data-end="197.5">Python in my humble opinion um it's like</span> <span data-start="197.5" data-end="199.93">you're flying I go you know err on the</span> <span data-start="199.93" data-end="201.58">side of the medicine cabinet comparison</span> <span data-start="201.58" data-end="204.01">thing but I think it's the Python but i</span> <span data-start="204.01" data-end="206.68">think it's the dojo really because it's</span> <span data-start="206.68" data-end="209.34">like flying if you want something you</span> <span data-start="209.34" data-end="213.13">just require it and it goes on and on</span> <span data-start="213.13" data-end="215.83">calendars there's a require for it and</span> <span data-start="215.83" data-end="217.72">it pulls it in file uploads everything</span> <span data-start="217.72" data-end="220.05">you could ever think that you wanted is</span> <span data-start="220.05" data-end="223.42">probably there you just don't know it</span> <span data-start="223.42" data-end="225.94">yet right it's partially the</span> <span data-start="225.94" data-end="228.22">documentation which is my first point on</span> <span data-start="228.22" data-end="230.86">what's wrong but it just goes on and on</span> <span data-start="230.86" data-end="234.31">there are so many wonderful components</span> <span data-start="234.31" data-end="237.63">in dojo that are just there so not only</span> <span data-start="237.63" data-end="239.98">it's it's not so much that you have to</span> <span data-start="239.98" data-end="243.04">use the the framework okay i think the</span> <span data-start="243.04" data-end="245.44">south park right have you seen the south</span> <span data-start="245.44" data-end="246.64">park where he's going around trying to</span> <span data-start="246.64" data-end="248.44">do something that the simpsons hasn't</span> <span data-start="248.44" data-end="252.489">done that's that's what dojo is really</span> <span data-start="252.489" data-end="254.47">it's we've been around so long we have</span> <span data-start="254.47" data-end="258.4">so much stuff that it's not necessarily</span> <span data-start="258.4" data-end="260.169">the best way to do it but it's there and</span> <span data-start="260.169" data-end="262.24">it's licensed it's free and you can use</span> <span data-start="262.24" data-end="263.71">it and you can take it and you can port</span> <span data-start="263.71" data-end="264.88">it and you can modify it and do whatever</span> <span data-start="264.88" data-end="267.34">you want but really consider looking at</span> <span data-start="267.34" data-end="269.44">it for nothing else other than to learn</span> <span data-start="269.44" data-end="271.57">the javascript because there's a huge</span> <span data-start="271.57" data-end="274.06">huge amount of talent that went into</span> <span data-start="274.06" data-end="278.05">this product so it adds up right go back</span> <span data-start="278.05" data-end="280.15">it adds up all of these modules that</span> <span data-start="280.15" data-end="282.22">you're that you're doing requiring in or</span> <span data-start="282.22" data-end="285.4">whatever our individual javascript files</span> <span data-start="285.4" data-end="287.89">and contradictory to the the performance</span> <span data-start="287.89" data-end="290.38">talk we saw earlier that's probably a</span> <span data-start="290.38" data-end="291.82">bad thing because its individual files</span> <span data-start="291.82" data-end="294.22">and its individual you know synchronous</span> <span data-start="294.22" data-end="297.49">requests out onto the server so the dojo</span> <span data-start="297.49" data-end="298.84">solution to that is the dojo build</span> <span data-start="298.84" data-end="300.45">system it's like an all-in-one</span> <span data-start="300.45" data-end="303.34">optimization kind of thing that happens</span> <span data-start="303.34" data-end="306.789">it starts works transparently with our</span> <span data-start="306.789" data-end="309.34">package system so when you don't require</span> <span data-start="309.34" data-end="310.6">something all of
