data-end="725.64">if there's a response I return this and</span> <span data-start="725.64" data-end="729.14">if there is no fire or no resource found</span> <span data-start="729.14" data-end="731.76">then the response is  and then</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="731.76" data-end="734.07">I forward to request and to the network</span> <span data-start="734.07" data-end="741.24">with the fatty function and yeah that's</span> <span data-start="741.24" data-end="743.67">the basic usage of the service worker</span> <span data-start="743.67" data-end="746.85">actually what we've seen so far is like</span> <span data-start="746.85" data-end="751.23">a usage and there is quite similar to</span> <span data-start="751.23" data-end="753.39">the app cache we have static files I'm</span> <span data-start="753.39" data-end="757.56">defined before before deployment of our</span> <span data-start="757.56" data-end="760.26">web app but it all happens with less</span> <span data-start="760.26" data-end="763.5">pain and more control and hopefully more</span> <span data-start="763.5" data-end="768.39">security will but what is more</span> <span data-start="768.39" data-end="769.66">interesting with service work</span> <span data-start="769.66" data-end="776.77">the caching of dynamic content so let's</span> <span data-start="776.77" data-end="780.61">go on and look how to do this there are</span> <span data-start="780.61" data-end="782.83">basically two strategies when it comes</span> <span data-start="782.83" data-end="786.04">to us dynamic contents requested during</span> <span data-start="786.04" data-end="788.35">the run time and the first one is</span> <span data-start="788.35" data-end="793.39">network first so you immediately forward</span> <span data-start="793.39" data-end="796">the request to the network and if it</span> <span data-start="796" data-end="797.86">fails you look up in the cache if you</span> <span data-start="797.86" data-end="800.83">have an old version and if it succeeds</span> <span data-start="800.83" data-end="804.31">you update the cache and you serve the</span> <span data-start="804.31" data-end="808.48">response to the web app yeah this code</span> <span data-start="808.48" data-end="810.91">is a bit a little bit just a little bit</span> <span data-start="810.91" data-end="814.36">more code about this approach first of</span> <span data-start="814.36" data-end="817.03">all we have another version for the</span> <span data-start="817.03" data-end="818.77">dynamic contents so it doesn't interfere</span> <span data-start="818.77" data-end="823.36">with our static assets and we</span> <span data-start="823.36" data-end="826.99">immediately forward the request to the</span> <span data-start="826.99" data-end="832.93">network and inside the decor back and</span> <span data-start="832.93" data-end="835.45">the Dan then method and we open our cash</span> <span data-start="835.45" data-end="840.04">with our current version and update the</span> <span data-start="840.04" data-end="842.5">cache that matches the requested</span> <span data-start="842.5" data-end="847.12">resource and we have this funny thing</span> <span data-start="847.12" data-end="850.87">here we have to clone the response so</span> <span data-start="850.87" data-end="854.95">responses response objects when they are</span> <span data-start="854.95" data-end="857.56">used once they're used up and gun so you</span> <span data-start="857.56" data-end="861.04">can't use the poor response for the cash</span> <span data-start="861.04" data-end="864.67">and for returning it to the web app we</span> <span data-start="864.67" data-end="866.32">have to clone it so the cash gets a</span> <span data-start="866.32" data-end="869.05">clone and the original one gets served</span> <span data-start="869.05" data-end="873.04">to the web app and finally if this fails</span> <span data-start="873.04" data-end="875.68">we just look up in the cache if we have</span> <span data-start="875.68" data-end="879.37">an old version to serve what we see here</span> <span data-start="879.37" data-end="883.42">is that we don't have to care about the</span> <span data-start="883.42" data-end="886.57">online status of the user there's this</span> <span data-start="886.57" data-end="889.87">online property on the navigator object</span> <span data-start="889.87" data-end="892.18">which tells us if the users online or</span> <span data-start="892.18" data-end="895.99">not but it isn't reliable so if users</span> <span data-start="895.99" data-end="898.3">are on shitty mobile connections which</span> <span data-start="898.3" data-end="901.24">leads to time outs or if they are on an</span> <span data-start="901.24" data-end="903.48">airport and don't want to pay for</span> <span data-start="903.48" data-end="906.06">the Wi-Fi this property you will tell us</span> <span data-start="906.06" data-end="908.1">we are the users online but actually</span> <span data-start="908.1" data-end="911.22">they aren't and with the service worker</span> <span data-start="911.22" data-end="914.1">of this approach to hit the network and</span> <span data-start="914.1" data-end="915.69">then look up in the cash we don't have</span> <span data-start="915.69" data-end="918.62">to care about that just do our stuff and</span> <span data-start="918.62" data-end="924.05">finally something will come to the user</span> <span data-start="924.05" data-end="928.41">yeah when to use this approach this is</span> <span data-start="928.41" data-end="931.74">good for for data that is updated very</span> <span data-start="931.74" data-end="935.43">frequently like soccer data at the</span> <span data-start="935.43" data-end="939.17">weekend so if you have a web app</span> <span data-start="939.17" data-end="942.57">displaying soccer results you might not</span> <span data-start="942.57" data-end="944.22">want to show the user the results from</span> <span data-start="944.22" data-end="946.92">the last weekend but the act the current</span> <span data-start="946.92" data-end="950.699">want to hit the network and if that</span> <span data-start="950.699" data-end="953.1">fails yeah you have to go with all data</span> <span data-start="953.1" data-end="956.699">and weather forecasts and stock market</span> <span data-start="956.699" data-end="959.1">data are typical examples for this kind</span> <span data-start="959.1" data-end="963.18">of contents here the other approach</span> <span data-start="963.18" data-end="965.97">would be to go cash first so just look</span> <span data-start="965.97" data-end="968.339">up in the cash and serve content really</span> <span data-start="968.339" data-end="970.86">fast but also do a request to look if</span> <span data-start="970.86" data-end="975.49">there's a new version of this resource</span> <span data-start="975.5" data-end="978.12">the code is a little bit different I</span> <span data-start="978.12" data-end="980.1">have this unavailable function i hope</span> <span data-start="980.1" data-end="981.87">you can read this from behind actually</span> <span data-start="981.87" data-end="986.61">this is okay no one said anything that's</span> <span data-start="986.61" data-end="990.66">good yeah this is unavailable function</span> <span data-start="990.66" data-end="992.94">which return to response with status are</span> <span data-start="992.94" data-end="995.22">five or three this is our last resort</span> <span data-start="995.22" data-end="998.22">but hopefully we'll get contents before</span> <span data-start="998.22" data-end="1001.339">so we immediately start hitting the cash</span> <span data-start="1001.339" data-end="1003.949">and look for a resource that matches our</span> <span data-start="1003.949" data-end="1007.97">request and at the end you can see we</span> <span data-start="1007.97" data-end="1010.699">return this but we also do our request</span> <span data-start="1010.699" data-end="1014.779">and again update the cache mr. the</span> <span data-start="1014.779" data-end="1018.05">response of the request succeeds and if</span> <span data-start="1018.05" data-end="1020.449">the result from the cache is</span> <span data-start="1020.449" data-end="1025.28">we will return our fetch promise and if</span> <span data-start="1025.28" data-end="1028.459">this fails as well then yeah we have to</span> <span data-start="1028.459" data-end="1030.23">take our unavailable function that</span> <span data-start="1030.23" data-end="1033.29">returns to five or three so we can</span> <span data-start="1033.29" data-end="1036.72">either return all the content fast</span> <span data-start="1036.72" data-end="1038.99">or a newer content from the network or</span> <span data-start="1038.99" data-end="1044.4">we fail gracefully with a 5 or 3 yeah</span> <span data-start="1044.4" data-end="1048.78">this is a good strategy for for contents</span> <span data-start="1048.78" data-end="1050.85">that aren't saw updated so frequently</span> <span data-start="1050.85" data-end="1055.32">like rock pools and news articles there</span> <span data-start="1055.32" data-end="1059.74">you can surf fast which is always good</span> <span data-start="1059.75" data-end="1063.299">yeah I kind of lied to you when I said</span> <span data-start="1063.299" data-end="1065.039">there are basically two strategies and</span> <span data-start="1065.039" data-end="1068.4">there are more you might have contents</span> <span data-start="1068.4" data-end="1070.11">where you don't want to serve old stuff</span> <span data-start="1070.11" data-end="1072.84">and only hit the network and don't</span> <span data-start="1072.84" data-end="1074.909">deserve anything at all if the users not</span> <span data-start="1074.909" data-end="1078.659">online you may also have contents where</span> <span data-start="1078.659" data-end="1080.82">you only have to hit the cash remember</span> <span data-start="1080.82" data-end="1082.86">the first example where I defined the</span> <span data-start="1082.86" data-end="1085.98">static assets I can be pretty sure that</span> <span data-start="1085.98" data-end="1088.679">they are installed every time the web</span> <span data-start="1088.679" data-end="1091.2">app is loaded and the service workers</span> <span data-start="1091.2" data-end="1093.75">installed so actually you don't have to</span> <span data-start="1093.75" data-end="1096.15">talk about anything and to the network I</span> <span data-start="1096.15" data-end="1099.09">just can hit the cash and serve really</span> <span data-start="1099.09" data-end="1101.22">fast and boost performance of my web app</span> <span data-start="1101.22" data-end="1107.309">and asses fastest approach on some</span> <span data-start="1107.309" data-end="1110.1">devices maybe take some time to to read</span> <span data-start="1110.1" data-end="1113.549">from disk if the device is old and test</span> <span data-start="1113.549" data-end="1117.48">a slow disk i/o operation and if you</span> <span data-start="1117.48" data-end="1119.97">request a very small aesthetic asset it</span> <span data-start="1119.97" data-end="1121.559">might be faster to get it from the</span> <span data-start="1121.559" data-end="1124.86">network so you can start a race and make</span> <span data-start="1124.86" data-end="1126.96">the request to the network and ask the</span> <span data-start="1126.96" data-end="1130.2">cash and whoever's fastest allowed to</span> <span data-start="1130.2" data-end="1136.71">self eventually so this was it yeah</span> <span data-start="1136.71" data-end="1139.169">what's next there are some service</span> <span data-start="1139.169" data-end="1142.95">worker related specifications for</span> <span data-start="1142.95" data-end="1146.37">example they push API which enables you</span> <span data-start="1146.37" data-end="1148.799">to annoy your users with push</span> <span data-start="1148.799" data-end="1151.35">notifications and what's nice about</span> <span data-start="1151.35" data-end="1154.559">service workers is that they they are</span> <span data-start="1154.559" data-end="1156.48">running in a threat in the background so</span> <span data-start="1156.48" data-end="1159.84">even if the web app is not active they</span> <span data-start="1159.84" data-end="1161.61">can receive push notifications and you</span> <span data-start="1161.61" data-end="1168">can handle them also and it does the</span> <span data-start="1168" data-end="1170.05">interesting thing is the back</span> <span data-start="1170.05" data-end="1175.03">think so the browser can store made</span> <span data-start="1175.03" data-end="1177.04">requests like post requests that the</span> <span data-start="1177.04" data-end="1179.85">user writes a message or something</span> <span data-start="1179.85" data-end="1184.15">similar and if the user then is offline</span> <span data-start="1184.15" data-end="1185.89">it's stored in the background and then</span> <span data-start="1185.89" data-end="1194.83">zoomed when the user goes online yeah</span> <span data-start="1194.83" data-end="1198.13">and finally give a fencing um it's a</span> <span data-start="1198.13" data-end="1202.81">good way to react to the the kaiserin</span> <span data-start="1202.81" data-end="1205.51">when the user enters or leaves a</span> <span data-start="1205.51" data-end="1208.18">specific region you could do this with</span> <span data-start="1208.18" data-end="1212.74">geolocation but here again we have this</span> <span data-start="1212.74" data-end="1215.17">nice thing that the background the</span> <span data-start="1215.17" data-end="1216.61">service worker is running in a</span> <span data-start="1216.61" data-end="1219.79">background so the web app doesn't have</span> <span data-start="1219.79" data-end="1224.49">to be active and you can react to this</span> <span data-start="1224.49" data-end="1230.92">nonetheless yeah what's also next is I</span> <span data-start="1230.92" data-end="1233.59">propose you learn more about service</span> <span data-start="1233.59" data-end="1235.93">workers and I have a list of resources</span> <span data-start="1235.93" data-end="1239.56">which I can recommend like a very

data-end="1295.57">handles service workers declaratively I</span> <span data-start="1295.57" data-end="1298.06">recommend this even if you don't want to</span> <span data-start="1298.06" data-end="1299.5">use this component but it's interesting</span> <span data-start="1299.5" data-end="1302.8">to see how they solve problems coming up</span> <span data-start="1302.8"
