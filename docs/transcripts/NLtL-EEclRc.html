data-end="140.6">do we even want to use node.js right</span> <span data-start="140.6" data-end="144.23">because we might have people completely</span> <span data-start="144.23" data-end="145.81">new to know the ass</span> <span data-start="145.81" data-end="149.18">so there are typically two categories of</span> <span data-start="149.18" data-end="152.15">systems one is input and output bount</span> <span data-start="152.15" data-end="154.7">and another a cpu-bound so when we're</span> <span data-start="154.7" data-end="157.239">building web applications we're usually</span> <span data-start="157.239" data-end="160.159">working with the input and output bound</span> <span data-start="160.159" data-end="162.89">systems so what is input and output it</span> <span data-start="162.89" data-end="165.26">could be writing to the database as</span> <span data-start="165.26" data-end="169.01">making a request to a server or a third</span> <span data-start="169.01"

we're working with nodejs and</span> <span data-start="192.73" data-end="195.65">usually we're building web servers we</span> <span data-start="195.65" data-end="197.959">might have some clients making requests</span> <span data-start="197.959" data-end="201.26">so under the hood of nodejs we have a</span> <span data-start="201.26" data-end="203.959">vent loop which was borrowed from google</span> <span data-start="203.959" data-end="207.17">chrome v8 engine so that event loop is</span> <span data-start="207.17" data-end="209.329">always looking for things to execute and</span> <span data-start="209.329" data-end="212.239">then it delegates the actual jobs the</span> <span data-start="212.239" data-end="215.359">actual processes to some other systems</span> <span data-start="215.359" data-end="218.9">for example a file system or database</span> <span data-start="218.9" data-end="224.359">etc so when the delegation happens event</span> <span data-start="224.359" data-end="227.15">loop also passes the callback which is</span> <span data-start="227.15" data-end="229.609">typically some JavaScript or node.js</span> <span data-start="229.609" data-end="232.549">code and when the system is done it's</span> <span data-start="232.549" data-end="234.62">over it's finished that callback is</span> <span data-start="234.62" data-end="237.29">executed and usually that go back has</span> <span data-start="237.29" data-end="239.9">the code to send back the data to the</span> <span data-start="239.9" data-end="241.819">client if we're talking about web</span> <span data-start="241.819" data-end="245.03">servers so how many of your Java</span> <span data-start="245.03" data-end="249.349">developers or started with Java okay so</span> <span data-start="249.349" data-end="251.93">even if you're not hardcore Java</span> <span data-start="251.93" data-end="253.669">developer you kind of guess what is</span> <span data-start="253.669" data-end="256.459">happening here there is a sleep method</span> <span data-start="256.459" data-end="260.51">and the key here probably this is the</span> <span data-start="260.51" data-end="262.28">most important piece in like the whole</span> <span data-start="262.28" data-end="265.07">presentation the key here is that Java</span> <span data-start="265.07" data-end="268.97">process will be put into so to say sleep</span> <span data-start="268.97" data-end="272.419">so nothing will be executed until that</span> <span data-start="272.419" data-end="275.24">one second passes so 1,000 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="275.24" data-end="278.78">or one second blocks the entire process</span> <span data-start="278.78" data-end="282.94">game contrat that with this node.js code</span> <span data-start="282.94" data-end="286.1">where we're scheduling the process in</span> <span data-start="286.1" data-end="288.59">the future by using a callback so that</span> <span data-start="288.59" data-end="290.57">function is sort of a set timeout it's</span> <span data-start="290.57" data-end="293.36">not executed right away it will be</span> <span data-start="293.36" data-end="296.54">executed in the future so from step one</span> <span data-start="296.54" data-end="299.18">we skip right to the step two then one</span> <span data-start="299.18" data-end="302.06">second passes and we would see step</span> <span data-start="302.06" data-end="305">three so why this is good because we</span> <span data-start="305" data-end="307.669">could execute more code while the</span> <span data-start="307.669" data-end="310.34">waiting is happening so the waiting is</span> <span data-start="310.34" data-end="311.51">not actually sleeping</span> <span data-start="311.51" data-end="314.33">it's just scheduling in the future so we</span> <span data-start="314.33" data-end="316.37">would see step one step two then we</span> <span data-start="316.37" data-end="318.62">would see step four and then we would</span> <span data-start="318.62" data-end="321.8">see after 1000 milliseconds step three</span> <span data-start="321.8" data-end="323.9">and step five so this is probably the</span> <span data-start="323.9" data-end="326.96">most important piece from this whole</span> <span data-start="326.96" data-end="330.38">presentation not just allows you to</span> <span data-start="330.38" data-end="334.69">write faster applications typically</span> <span data-start="334.69" data-end="337.52">because we're utilizing that idle</span> <span data-start="337.52" data-end="340.91">waiting time so let's talk about web</span> <span data-start="340.91" data-end="343.13">servers a little bit so this is how we</span> <span data-start="343.13" data-end="345.83">would write a web server schematically</span> <span data-start="345.83" data-end="349.4">of course just a diagram using some of</span> <span

data-end="495.119">necessity how you would scale a blocking</span> <span data-start="495.119" data-end="499.079">system right so the blocking system they</span> <span data-start="499.079" data-end="501.269">have to be multi-threaded in nodejs</span> <span data-start="501.269" data-end="503.879">it's a single threaded system so it</span> <span data-start="503.879"
