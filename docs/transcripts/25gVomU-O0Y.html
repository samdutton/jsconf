data-end="1559.77">just an idea that I had where you have</span> <span data-start="1559.77" data-end="1562.23">an exquisite corpse but with code so i</span> <span data-start="1562.23" data-end="1564.63">have this repo set up here you guys can</span> <span data-start="1564.63" data-end="1566.49">totally go to that and right now it's</span> <span data-start="1566.49" data-end="1568.77">just i think it's just the terminal like</span> <span data-start="1568.77" data-end="1570.39">spinning out a bunch console logging a</span> <span data-start="1570.39" data-end="1572.64">bunch of random numbers and so the idea</span> <span data-start="1572.64" data-end="1574.77">is to just build on top of that and see</span> <span data-start="1574.77"
