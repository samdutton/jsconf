of two user should this</span> <span data-start="1197.11" data-end="1200.409">thing solve that that is a very good</span> <span data-start="1200.409" data-end="1202.78">question always to your designer so what</span> <span data-start="1202.78" data-end="1205.09">should it do how should it help the user</span> <span data-start="1205.09" data-end="1209.37">to solve a problem or to reach a

data-end="1220.69">there's a drop shadow now and your</span> <span data-start="1220.69" data-end="1222.549">button and the drop shadow is there</span> <span data-start="1222.549" data-end="1225.94">because there's now a button on a darker</span> <span data-start="1225.94" data-end="1228.039">background than before so then you</span> <span data-start="1228.039"

in which case so awesome</span> <span data-start="1366.7" data-end="1368.919">how does it look like when we render it</span> <span data-start="1368.919" data-end="1370.72">and reactive over it looks like this</span> <span data-start="1370.72" data-end="1373.33">that you can at least see what kind of</span> <span data-start="1373.33" data-end="1375.97">props you are applying to it and what</span> <span data-start="1375.97" data-end="1379.239">values they have but in the end it just</span> <span data-start="1379.239" data-end="1382.09">is combined into again one style class</span> <span

data-start="1410.109" data-end="1411.7">let's try a different approach</span> <span data-start="1411.7" data-end="1415.539">don't use props try the extents but</span> <span data-start="1415.539" data-end="1419.169">suddenly I have by like having just</span> <span data-start="1419.169" data-end="1422.619">primary secondary normal active and</span> <span data-start="1422.619"

data-end="1435.22">how they look in the browser and somehow</span> <span data-start="1435.22" data-end="1440.099">the primary inactive has six classes six</span> <span data-start="1440.099" data-end="1444.789">classes okay and somehow from these six</span> <span data-start="1444.789" data-end="1450.56">classes only three provides style</span> <span data-start="1450.56" data-end="1453.59">what why so at first I thought I have</span> <span data-start="1453.59" data-end="1454.82">done something wrong maybe I have</span> <span data-start="1454.82" data-end="1458.15">misconfigured soy components but then I</span> <span data-start="1458.15" data-end="1460.61">found that on github and one of the</span> <span data-start="1460.61" data-end="1462.68">contributor says how we did to some</span> <span data-start="1462.68" data-end="1466.55">purpose that we add always another class</span> <span data-start="1466.55" data-end="1469.82">to it that is therefore identifying your</span> <span data-start="1469.82" data-end="1473.09">component because when you have a closer</span> <span data-start="1473.09" data-end="1476.11">look on all these classes they change</span> <span data-start="1476.11" data-end="1479.06">their name every time you add a new</span> <span data-start="1479.06" data-end="1483.35">style or remove a style so there is no</span> <span data-start="1483.35" data-end="1485.51">way how you can like predict what is</span> <span data-start="1485.51" data-end="1488">happening based on your site class but</span> <span data-start="1488" data-end="1490.31">the other the second class which hasn't</span> <span data-start="1490.31" data-end="1494.21">any style rules is the identifier which</span> <span data-start="1494.21" data-end="1497.03">is also just gibberish so maybe someone</span> <span data-start="1497.03" data-end="1499.94">can tell me why they didn't prefix them</span> <span data-start="1499.94" data-end="1503.21">on default I don't know but they decided</span> <span data-start="1503.21" data-end="1504.05">against it</span> <span data-start="1504.05" data-end="1508.4">okay let's look at some more classic</span> <span data-start="1508.4" data-end="1511.46">stuff let's look at normal CSS or sass</span> <span data-start="1511.46" data-end="1515.3">in this okay in this case where I have</span> <span data-start="1515.3" data-end="1517.37">created a button and added just the</span> <span data-start="1517.37" data-end="1519.68">classes like I would usually do with</span> <span data-start="1519.68" data-end="1526.95">primary and overwriting by inactive and</span> <span

data-start="1531.56" data-end="1534.5">tell like which class is causing which</span> <span data-start="1534.5" data-end="1537.77">style which is nice for debugging I</span> <span data-start="1537.77" data-end="1540.32">would say and also maybe for identifying</span> <span data-start="1540.32" data-end="1543.23">where I should probably optimize my</span> <span data-start="1543.23" data-end="1548.42">style okay but probs I want to have</span> <span data-start="1548.42" data-end="1551.84">props please give me my props back ok</span> <span data-start="1551.84" data-end="1555.74">maybe I have something how about best of</span> <span data-start="1555.74" data-end="1558.65">both worlds so maybe some of you have</span> <span data-start="1558.65" data-end="1560.81">already stats I component tries to</span> <span data-start="1560.81" data-end="1563">create a higher-order component which is</span> <span data-start="1563" data-end="1565.76">and react higher-order components</span> <span data-start="1565.76" data-end="1568.76">and react higher-order components so let's do some higher-order component</span> <span data-start="1568.76" data-end="1571.4">so let's create a higher-order component</span> <span data-start="1571.4" data-end="1574.94">for a button and give it some props for</span> <span data-start="1574.94" data-end="1577.7">example a type for example the inactive</span> <span data-start="1577.7" data-end="1582.82">and then take these props and</span> <span data-start="1582.82" data-end="1586.15">make them into bemmon classes so we now</span> <span data-start="1586.15" data-end="1589.36">have like the button st lock and the</span> <span data-start="1589.36" data-end="1592.8">primary ended active has modifiers and</span> <span data-start="1592.8" data-end="1596.71">then we just like give it to the</span> <span data-start="1596.71" data-end="1604.33">component and we turn a button and also</span> <span data-start="1604.33" data-end="1606.91">something that we can do now which side</span> <span data-start="1606.91" data-end="1609.37">component doesn't with the process we</span> <span data-start="1609.37" data-end="1613.23">can define prop types and default props</span> <span data-start="1613.23" data-end="1616.45">so everybody that wants to reuse a</span> <span data-start="1616.45" data-end="1618.76">component we have done for example</span> <span data-start="1618.76" data-end="1621.64">button knows exactly what they can give</span> <span data-start="1621.64" data-end="1625.57">as prop and we'll get like meaningful</span> <span data-start="1625.57" data-end="1627.22">warning and error messages in the</span> <span data-start="1627.22" data-end="1629.02">debugger when they saw something wrong</span> <span data-start="1629.02" data-end="1634.12">with it just really nice I believe okay</span> <span data-start="1634.12" data-end="1638.35">so let's summarize that was a lot of</span> <span data-start="1638.35" data-end="1646.12">talking about CSS okay the render</span> <span data-start="1646.12" data-end="1647.86">blocking part we talked about it in the</span> <span data-start="1647.86" data-end="1650.02">beginning we can solve it with side</span> <span data-start="1650.02" data-end="1651.4">components you can solve it with</span> <span data-start="1651.4" data-end="1655.48">backpack so and then you would probably</span> <span data-start="1655.48" data-end="1658.06">need to look at what is going to be more</span> <span data-start="1658.06" data-end="1662.43">performant for you in the long run then</span> <span data-start="1662.43" data-end="1666.73">the conventions like using a design</span> <span data-start="1666.73" data-end="1668.8">pattern like atomic design and naming</span> <span data-start="1668.8" data-end="1671.65">conventions like them help you even if</span> <span data-start="1671.65" data-end="1673.63">you are using side components but also</span> <span data-start="1673.63" data-end="1675.28">you can use them with other components</span> <span data-start="1675.28" data-end="1680.14">and get rid of a couple of node modules</span> <span data-start="1680.14" data-end="1687.85">maybe then we had thought that</span> <span data-start="1687.85" data-end="1689.98">communication can solve some problems</span> <span data-start="1689.98" data-end="1693.31">like naming like having too many</span> <span data-start="1693.31" data-end="1695.05">variations on your website so</span> <span data-start="1695.05" data-end="1698.35">communication is always king and will</span> <span data-start="1698.35" data-end="1701.14">definitely help you on getting rid of a</span> <span data-start="1701.14" data-end="1706.84">lot of your problems and then the last</span> <span data-start="1706.84" data-end="1708.67">thing is props are really really fancy</span> <span data-start="1708.67" data-end="1712.92">but they're dangerous and may be hard to</span> <span data-start="1712.92" data-end="1717.07">debug and maintain</span> <span data-start="1717.08" data-end="1722.429">okay so but when is Sai components</span> <span data-start="1722.429" data-end="1724.23">really beneficial for you because I mean</span> <span data-start="1724.23" data-end="1726.84">a lot of users people are using it</span> <span data-start="1726.84" data-end="1730.5">already and like it and love it and so I</span> <span data-start="1730.5" data-end="1733.529">would say if you want to bootstrap</span> <span data-start="1733.529" data-end="1735.179">something very quick because you don't</span> <span data-start="1735.179" data-end="1737.46">have to think too much about CSS</span> <span data-start="1737.46" data-end="1739.35">architecture and everything just put it</span> <span data-start="1739.35" data-end="1742.38">next to your render stuff and you're</span> <span data-start="1742.38" data-end="1747.299">good to go it's really cool then yeah</span> <span data-start="1747.299" data-end="1749.34">when you don't have a designer or you're</span> <span data-start="1749.34" data-end="1752.279">not easily able to talk to them I'm not</span> <span data-start="1752.279" data-end="1754.139">saying that you don't want to talk to</span> <span data-start="1754.139" data-end="1756.659">them but maybe in some companies</span> <span data-start="1756.659"

data-end="1776.88">yet but the most awesome thing about the</span> <span data-start="1776.88" data-end="1779.519">site component approach is that you can</span> <span data-start="1779.519"
