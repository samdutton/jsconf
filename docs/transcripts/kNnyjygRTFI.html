<p><span data-start="8.4" data-end="15.219">thank you all right so um yeah I'm</span> <span data-start="15.219" data-end="20.86">Martin welcome to 3d um yeah the reason</span> <span data-start="20.86" data-end="24.13">I I decided to do those talk as just</span> <span data-start="24.13" data-end="28.42">that every 3d introduction that you read</span> <span data-start="28.42" data-end="30.55">somehow assumes that you already know</span> <span data-start="30.55" data-end="33.79">quite a lot about 3d so I'm here to</span> <span data-start="33.79" data-end="37.39">clear a bit obvious things up in the</span> <span data-start="37.39" data-end="40.93">last half year something I've been doing</span> <span data-start="40.93" data-end="44.62">quite a lot of work but has had to do</span> <span data-start="44.62" data-end="47.35">with three jrs had to do with WebGL and</span> <span data-start="47.35" data-end="53.89">so I came to learn the hard way and so</span> <span data-start="53.89" data-end="55.869">this is one of the project i'm currently</span> <span data-start="55.869" data-end="57.67">working on which is basically just</span> <span data-start="57.67" data-end="62.35">rendering study to see how we can</span> <span data-start="62.35" data-end="65.47">achieve real nice looking effects with</span> <span data-start="65.47" data-end="69.189">very simple polygons and all those</span> <span data-start="69.189" data-end="71.26">post-processing that is required to do</span> <span data-start="71.26" data-end="77.89">that and yeah this is one of the studies</span> <span data-start="77.89" data-end="80.71">for the intro for Jays convoy Lopez the</span> <span data-start="80.71" data-end="84.359">first time I'm showing this publicly so</span> <span data-start="84.359" data-end="87.31">the problem with WebGL is basically it's</span> <span data-start="87.31" data-end="92.02">learning curve so maybe if you read a</span> <span data-start="92.02" data-end="94.27">little bit about what 3d in the web can</span> <span data-start="94.27" data-end="96.85">do and you're like hey we can do this</span> <span data-start="96.85" data-end="99.81">thing in 3d only to discover that</span> <span data-start="99.81" data-end="102.88">somehow along this straight wall of</span> <span data-start="102.88" data-end="105.85">learning curve you just say no maybe we</span> <span data-start="105.85" data-end="109.45">find a simpler solution another problem</span> <span data-start="109.45" data-end="114.249">here is every WebGL tutorial ever starts</span> <span data-start="114.249" data-end="116.229">with hey let's just draw a triangle</span> <span data-start="116.229" data-end="119.139">which is very okay so you create camera</span> <span data-start="119.139" data-end="121.63">then you have to set some parameters you</span> <span data-start="121.63" data-end="123.719">don't know about and we need to create</span> <span data-start="123.719" data-end="126.219">two shaders the fragment and vertex</span> <span data-start="126.219" data-end="128.14">shader come to that later and those</span> <span data-start="128.14" data-end="130.209">traders yeah well they have written in a</span> <span data-start="130.209" data-end="132.67">different language but don't worry too</span> <span data-start="132.67" data-end="134.59">much because we're still not done</span> <span data-start="134.59" data-end="139.36">drawing a triangle finally right there</span> <span data-start="139.36" data-end="141.74">was a vertices array that</span> <span data-start="141.74" data-end="143.54">and those are the points of the triangle</span> <span data-start="143.54" data-end="145.85">and it's really those code really just</span> <span data-start="145.85" data-end="148.76">ran as a black or white triangle on the</span> <span data-start="148.76" data-end="153.68">black background so yeah it's so III</span> <span data-start="153.68" data-end="156.74">think that there is a better way to</span> <span data-start="156.74" data-end="159.17">explain this and I will do this without</span> <span data-start="159.17" data-end="161.09">showing you any color so the way that</span> <span data-start="161.09" data-end="163.76">will work is basically i'm following</span> <span data-start="163.76" data-end="166.55">buzzword after buzzword at you and try</span> <span data-start="166.55" data-end="168.65">to explain what all these words mean in</span> <span data-start="168.65" data-end="173.12">the 3d world so I did this the hard way</span> <span data-start="173.12" data-end="175.49">because this is a one really really</span> <span data-start="175.49" data-end="178.07">awesome book but really really have your</span> <span data-start="178.07" data-end="181.85">math but yeah it's quite worth reading</span> <span data-start="181.85" data-end="184.88">because it explores all those fully</span> <span data-start="184.88" data-end="187.85">rendering up to how current generation</span> <span data-start="187.85" data-end="190.52">games do they are rendering in greatest</span> <span data-start="190.52" data-end="194.08">detail so if you really want a deep dive</span> <span data-start="194.08" data-end="199.55">all of this book so I'm contributor</span> <span data-start="199.55" data-end="203.66">graphics and 3d rendering is a really</span> <span data-start="203.66" data-end="207.56">vast field so we have around around 50</span> <span data-start="207.56" data-end="209.66">years of research having gone on in to</span> <span data-start="209.66" data-end="213.62">this this yeah probably one of the best</span> <span data-start="213.62" data-end="216.38">funded areas of research just games</span> <span data-start="216.38" data-end="218.09">industry the visual effects for</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="218.09" data-end="221.75">Hollywood all those that rely on 3d</span> <span data-start="221.75" data-end="224.6">graphics poor vast amounts of money into</span> <span data-start="224.6" data-end="227.39">it so there's no shortage and research</span> <span data-start="227.39" data-end="232.04">and yeah finally it's also a really huge</span> <span data-start="232.04" data-end="234.86">scientific field it involves physics and</span> <span data-start="234.86" data-end="238.58">involves math so it involves lots of</span> <span data-start="238.58" data-end="241.46">numerics and information technology</span> <span data-start="241.46" data-end="244.19">things there are feels like radiometry</span> <span data-start="244.19" data-end="254.99">and all the likes involved so what is 3d</span> <span data-start="254.99" data-end="258.14">rendering the basic idea and 3d</span> <span data-start="258.14" data-end="261.44">rendering is let me use a virtual camera</span> <span data-start="261.44" data-end="264.83">to take pictures of virtual scene so</span> <span data-start="264.83" data-end="268.52">it's a pretty easy like that to it but</span> <span data-start="268.52" data-end="271.34">yeah how do we do this</span> <span data-start="271.34" data-end="273.32">we need to figure out how how light</span> <span data-start="273.32" data-end="275.419">would behave in over to virtual the</span> <span data-start="275.419" data-end="279.919">world and finally find out which parts</span> <span data-start="279.919" data-end="281.66">of the light will end up in our camera</span> <span data-start="281.66" data-end="286.479">sensor and form the pixels on screen so</span> <span data-start="286.479" data-end="289.1">naive solution to those what the year we</span> <span data-start="289.1" data-end="291.169">make a simulation of how the photons</span> <span data-start="291.169" data-end="293.84">behave and how they bounce around on a</span> <span data-start="293.84" data-end="296.389">scene and finally figure out which of</span> <span data-start="296.389" data-end="298.82">these photons hit the camera sensor and</span> <span data-start="298.82" data-end="301.31">get this play but yeah as you may know a</span> <span data-start="301.31" data-end="304.58">quite many photons to simulate there so</span> <span data-start="304.58" data-end="308.96">there's not an option um so this leads</span> <span data-start="308.96" data-end="312.65">to some rendering techniques being</span> <span data-start="312.65" data-end="316.01">developed that and I will show you the</span> <span data-start="316.01" data-end="320.389">most prominent ones just right now so</span> <span data-start="320.389" data-end="323.03">the first thing is the ray tracing and</span> <span data-start="323.03" data-end="327.229">path tracing the idea behind this is but</span> <span data-start="327.229" data-end="331.01">you that you just trace how how race</span> <span data-start="331.01" data-end="336.2">behave in your light seen you can see</span> <span data-start="336.2" data-end="338.87">there are left pictures basically how</span> <span data-start="338.87" data-end="341.27">how light normally behave so you have a</span> <span data-start="341.27" data-end="344.09">yellow ray it hits an object and gets</span> <span data-start="344.09" data-end="347.36">gets reflected of that object so the</span> <span data-start="347.36" data-end="350.33">orange race and then all these refer the</span> <span data-start="350.33" data-end="352.7">reflected rays are reflected themselves</span> <span data-start="352.7" data-end="355.52">so those are the rep raised and then you</span> <span data-start="355.52" data-end="358.28">can see what's happening and we can we</span> <span data-start="358.28" data-end="361.099">can describe each of these paths of</span> <span data-start="361.099" data-end="364.22">light which you can see in our right</span> <span data-start="364.22" data-end="371.03">hand picture so what path tracing now</span> <span data-start="371.03" data-end="374.51">does that is it starts backwards so you</span> <span data-start="374.51" data-end="375.77">have a camera or somewhere in the scene</span> <span data-start="375.77" data-end="378.2">and you cast a riot ray out of the</span> <span data-start="378.2" data-end="382.419">camera so this looks a bit like those</span> <span data-start="382.419" data-end="386.21">apologize for the for the contrast not</span> <span data-start="386.21" data-end="389.18">that awesome beemo so we help a camera</span> <span data-start="389.18" data-end="391.22">and we start with a red rays and we</span> <span data-start="391.22" data-end="393.95">recast those of you raised into the</span> <span data-start="393.95" data-end="396.65">scene and see where it hits an object so</span> <span data-start="396.65" data-end="399.07">at that point where it's an object</span> <span data-start="399.07" data-end="401.599">several of things might happen so the</span> <span data-start="401.599" data-end="404.599">first we'll draw these lines towards</span> <span data-start="404.599" data-end="405">ever</span> <span data-start="405" data-end="407.61">every light source and a scene to see it</span> <span data-start="407.61" data-end="412.13">is in shadow or isn't it and otherwise</span> <span data-start="412.13" data-end="414.54">which is the case for the for the right</span> <span data-start="414.54" data-end="417.84">hand point of intersection there could</span> <span data-start="417.84" data-end="420.27">be a reflection which is the green ray</span> <span data-start="420.27" data-end="422.82">or it could be refracted through the</span> <span data-start="422.82" data-end="426">material if it's made of glass of water</span> <span data-start="426" data-end="429.24">or something so this will be the blu-ray</span> <span data-start="429.24" data-end="433.49">and finally things can happen like</span> <span data-start="433.49" data-end="436.77">subsurface scattering which is shown on</span> <span data-start="436.77" data-end="438.6">the left hand side where rather light</span> <span data-start="438.6" data-end="441.96">slightly emphasis circles gets bounced</span> <span data-start="441.96" data-end="444.03">around and exits the surface at another</span> <span data-start="444.03" data-end="447.66">point so um what ray tracing and pulse</span> <span data-start="447.66" data-end="449.73">racing now try to do is calculate</span> <span data-start="449.73" data-end="453.03">backwards towards the light source where</span> <span data-start="453.03" data-end="455.04">the light shines on that object is</span> <span data-start="455.04" data-end="459.15">coming from the point the point of use</span> <span data-start="459.15" data-end="461.25">algorithms that they are really very</span> <span data-start="461.25" data-end="465.41">accurate they can they can have a really</span> <span data-start="465.41" data-end="469.919">amazing quality especially in rendering</span> <span data-start="469.919" data-end="474.66">how whole shadows and lights behave they</span> <span data-start="474.66" data-end="478.02">support several special behaviors the</span> <span data-start="478.02" data-end="480.06">commonly called global illumination</span> <span data-start="480.06" data-end="482.58">which is refers to or everything that is</span> <span data-start="482.58" data-end="485.19">illumination that isn't directly from a</span> <span data-start="485.19" data-end="487.229">light source so in this room for</span> <span data-start="487.229" data-end="488.729">instance we only have global</span> <span data-start="488.729" data-end="490.89">illumination because the light sources</span> <span data-start="490.89" data-end="495.27">are basically hidden from us okay and</span> <span data-start="495.27" data-end="498.81">yeah ray tracing or more path tracing</span> <span data-start="498.81" data-end="502.44">are used for everything that doesn't</span> <span data-start="502.44" data-end="503.97">need to be in real time well</span> <span data-start="503.97" data-end="506.13">unfortunately it's we are still not</span> <span data-start="506.13" data-end="507.63">there that we can do those in real time</span> <span data-start="507.63" data-end="510.87">just because the amount of computation</span> <span data-start="510.87" data-end="514.589">required us way too big Princeton's</span> <span data-start="514.589" data-end="518.159">twice Daria they took for rendering the</span> <span data-start="518.159" data-end="523.65">movie around 2 to 15 hours for every</span> <span data-start="523.65" data-end="525.33">single image in the film and they were</span> <span data-start="525.33" data-end="529.83">like 140,000 images so it took some time</span> <span data-start="529.83" data-end="533.339">to render that new movie okay so here's</span> <span data-start="533.339" data-end="540.77">an example of someone actually built a</span> <span data-start="540.77" data-end="546.68">real path tracing renderer in WebGL and</span> <span data-start="546.68" data-end="551.04">like can change the scene here and we</span> <span data-start="551.04" data-end="552.959">can move move move around to other</span> <span data-start="552.959" data-end="555.209">camera and you can see some some of the</span> <span data-start="555.209" data-end="559.11">effects that only path tracing can do</span> <span data-start="559.11" data-end="561.32">like these shadows here in between or</span> <span data-start="561.32" data-end="565.13">these refractions within that glass ball</span> <span data-start="565.13" data-end="567.99">we can even just camera Pam our</span> <span data-start="567.99" data-end="571.52">parameters like the focal length or the</span> <span data-start="571.52" data-end="574.5">aperture size of the camera so it's it's</span> <span data-start="574.5" data-end="577.44">a really good simulation of how how</span> <span data-start="577.44" data-end="583.77">light really behaves anyway um the main</span> <span data-start="583.77" data-end="585.78">techniques exist that is useful for a</span> <span data-start="585.78" data-end="588.839">real-time rendering though is called</span> <span data-start="588.839" data-end="591.72">rasterization and together with scanline</span> <span data-start="591.72" data-end="594.15">rendering which is accompanying</span> <span data-start="594.15" data-end="599.48">technique so basically all applications</span> <span data-start="599.48" data-end="602.76">like games or everything that does 3d</span> <span data-start="602.76" data-end="606.45">graphics in real time uses this</span> <span data-start="606.45" data-end="610.02">technique to renderer so this is</span> <span data-start="610.02" data-end="613.16">basically also GPUs are designed for</span> <span data-start="613.16" data-end="619.5">this restoration technique so what</span> <span data-start="619.5" data-end="623.13">rasterization basically does is we have</span> <span data-start="623.13" data-end="625.56">objects that are described as a huge</span> <span data-start="625.56" data-end="628.74">amount of triangles and each of these</span> <span data-start="628.74" data-end="632.82">triangles is then split up according to</span> <span data-start="632.82" data-end="635.07">which screen pixels are covered by it</span> <span data-start="635.07" data-end="639.66">and then finally for every pixel of the</span> <span data-start="639.66" data-end="643.35">color is provided it's calculated from</span> <span data-start="643.35" data-end="645.69">the data that is available for that</span> <span data-start="645.69" data-end="654.6">triangle so um in order to explain more</span> <span data-start="654.6" data-end="657.66">deeply what this rasterization does is</span> <span data-start="657.66" data-end="662.1">we need to take a look at some math so</span> <span data-start="662.1" data-end="664.579">let's begin with the rendering equation</span> <span data-start="664.579" data-end="668.07">this is a funny mix of calculus and</span> <span data-start="668.07" data-end="669.51">linear algebra</span> <span data-start="669.51" data-end="674.67">and trigonometry yeah but nope you</span> <span data-start="674.67" data-end="676.41">really didn't don't need to know too</span> <span data-start="676.41" data-end="680.49">much math in order to work with 3d there</span> <span data-start="680.49" data-end="682.68">are just three four things that i'm</span> <span data-start="682.68" data-end="684.81">going to show you that that you need to</span> <span data-start="684.81" data-end="688.32">be aware of so first is we have</span> <span data-start="688.32" data-end="692.25">coordinates bases a coordinate space is</span> <span data-start="692.25" data-end="694.17">basically just the frame of reference so</span> <span data-start="694.17" data-end="697.77">it shows for any given back to where we</span> <span data-start="697.77" data-end="699.54">are the origin point is the vector</span> <span data-start="699.54" data-end="703.77">refers to and it has three axis XY and Z</span> <span data-start="703.77" data-end="707.64">and yeah these three axes are organized</span> <span data-start="707.64" data-end="709.44">another right-handed system so if you</span> <span data-start="709.44" data-end="711.72">take your right hand hold up like this</span> <span data-start="711.72" data-end="715.74">thumb is the x-axis or y-axis and the z</span> <span data-start="715.74" data-end="718.41">axis so this is how you have always find</span> <span data-start="718.41" data-end="721.2">out which direction which axis is</span> <span data-start="721.2" data-end="724.44">pointing to so in this case we have x</span> <span data-start="724.44" data-end="727.32">axis pointing pointing from left to</span> <span data-start="727.32" data-end="729.87">right y axis up like a node and the z</span> <span data-start="729.87" data-end="734.24">axis is coming towards you so um</span> <span data-start="734.24" data-end="738.81">vertices this is a here you probably all</span> <span data-start="738.81" data-end="744.66">know vectors do you mass at school all</span> <span data-start="744.66" data-end="749.31">right so vertices is just a vertex just</span> <span data-start="749.31" data-end="751.8">the term used in 3d graphics for vectors</span> <span data-start="751.8" data-end="756.03">and enough so it's basically just a</span> <span data-start="756.03" data-end="758.82">single point somewhere in a cabinet</span> <span data-start="758.82" data-end="761.64">space so in this this example was a</span> <span data-start="761.64" data-end="764.87">teapot you can see the thin black line</span> <span data-start="764.87" data-end="767.61">which points to the director to the</span> <span data-start="767.61" data-end="771.11">point where we had 111 coordinate is and</span> <span data-start="771.11" data-end="775.53">yeah so every vertex have the three</span> <span data-start="775.53" data-end="778.53">components of the dial in direction of x</span> <span data-start="778.53" data-end="782.97">y&z axis so what we can do with vertices</span> <span data-start="782.97" data-end="786.54">is now we can transform them you will</span> <span data-start="786.54" data-end="790.14">probably know from CSS these CSS</span> <span data-start="790.14" data-end="794.85">transform this is the same thing so um</span> <span data-start="794.85" data-end="797.67">we can rotate them we can translate them</span> <span data-start="797.67" data-end="799.8">so move them around we can scale them</span> <span data-start="799.8" data-end="802.47">and all of this is done with something</span> <span data-start="802.47" data-end="803.07">called</span> <span data-start="803.07" data-end="804.96">matrix multiplication don't worry too</span> <span data-start="804.96" data-end="807.09">much because you have a math library</span> <span data-start="807.09" data-end="809.67">that takes care of those so it's just</span> <span data-start="809.67" data-end="811.56">you have a matrix and you have a vector</span> <span data-start="811.56" data-end="814.08">and you basically throw that vector at</span> <span data-start="814.08" data-end="818.47">the matrix and out comes another waxhaw</span> <span data-start="818.48" data-end="822.9">so that matrix yeah just the recipe</span> <span data-start="822.9" data-end="826.23">about how to make one vector of another</span> <span data-start="826.23" data-end="829.14">vector and the recipe contains all these</span> <span data-start="829.14" data-end="832.65">rotations translations and so on so</span> <span data-start="832.65" data-end="835.86">another thing I need I need to talk</span> <span data-start="835.86" data-end="839.25">about a hormone homogeneous coordinates</span> <span data-start="839.25" data-end="843.36">and this is a weird term but you will if</span> <span data-start="843.36" data-end="846.84">you start diving into 3d graphics you</span> <span data-start="846.84" data-end="848.76">will see four dimensional coordinates</span> <span data-start="848.76" data-end="852.15">everywhere so don't vary they simulate a</span> <span data-start="852.15" data-end="855.39">similar just describe a point in 3d</span> <span data-start="855.39" data-end="859.32">space i have x y&z corner and the force</span> <span data-start="859.32" data-end="861.3">why are you it's basically just used to</span> <span data-start="861.3" data-end="864.75">enable some mathematic tricks that are</span> <span data-start="864.75" data-end="866.88">you that are required for some</span> <span data-start="866.88" data-end="868.23">calculations you don't need to worry</span> <span data-start="868.23" data-end="876.15">about so moving on the the single most</span> <span data-start="876.15" data-end="878.76">important thing and 3d graphics are the</span> <span data-start="878.76" data-end="883.17">geometry so geometry is defined using</span> <span data-start="883.17" data-end="887.13">triangles or in some other in some other</span> <span data-start="887.13" data-end="890.82">systems like direct x jail we can also</span> <span data-start="890.82" data-end="892.91">use quartz which are rectangles</span> <span data-start="892.91" data-end="897.12">basically and those are called faces and</span> <span data-start="897.12" data-end="899.64">all of these faces together like you can</span> <span data-start="899.64" data-end="901.92">see in the picture we form from the</span> <span data-start="901.92" data-end="906.81">surface of the object so all of these</span> <span data-start="906.81" data-end="909.87">all of these triangles are described by</span> <span data-start="909.87" data-end="913.05">three points three vertices and all of</span> <span data-start="913.05" data-end="916.35">these vertices have a common reference</span> <span data-start="916.35" data-end="918.66">point a comment coordinate system this</span> <span data-start="918.66" data-end="920.4">coordinate system is called the object</span> <span data-start="920.4" data-end="924.21">space so reason for this is that you can</span> <span data-start="924.21" data-end="928.29">move the object space around without</span> <span data-start="928.29" data-end="931.8">having to modify any of the vertices so</span> <span data-start="931.8" data-end="933.87">the shape of the object stays the same</span> <span data-start="933.87" data-end="936.51">where you can move and rotate and sky</span> <span data-start="936.51" data-end="942.18">look around so from the from the</span> <span data-start="942.18" data-end="946.47">geometry we come to object so an object</span> <span data-start="946.47" data-end="949.92">in 3d is just a combination of the</span> <span data-start="949.92" data-end="952.98">geometry and a material information will</span> <span data-start="952.98" data-end="960.23">come to that later so the object is the</span> <span data-start="960.23" data-end="963.63">provides provides the coordinate space</span> <span data-start="963.63" data-end="966.59">for the vertices of a geometry and</span> <span data-start="966.59" data-end="970.44">managers all these transforms that I</span> <span data-start="970.44" data-end="972.74">used on that object to move it around</span> <span data-start="972.74" data-end="977.88">and finally get objects are hierarchical</span> <span data-start="977.88" data-end="982.44">so they can contain more objects so if I</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="982.44" data-end="985.65">I came for instance just a model robot</span> <span data-start="985.65" data-end="988.83">by I have a body and a child of the body</span> <span data-start="988.83" data-end="991.5">would be the arm so if I move the body</span> <span data-start="991.5" data-end="994.71">around but I'm moves with it so the arm</span> <span data-start="994.71" data-end="999.9">uses the body as a reference and finally</span> <span data-start="999.9" data-end="1005.18">there's one root object in every 15 so</span> <span data-start="1005.18" data-end="1008.87">well this is also in three.js is called</span> <span data-start="1008.87" data-end="1012.83">the scene and i hope the term in various</span> <span data-start="1012.83" data-end="1016.88">other systems as well so yeah the root</span> <span data-start="1016.88" data-end="1019.69">object hosts the one coordinate space</span> <span data-start="1019.69" data-end="1022.13">that is called the world coordinate</span> <span data-start="1022.13" data-end="1024.11">space which is a single point of</span> <span data-start="1024.11" data-end="1027.5">reference for everything and it also</span> <span data-start="1027.5" data-end="1031.4">contains special objects like cameras</span> <span data-start="1031.4" data-end="1034.01">that do the actual filming of your scene</span> <span data-start="1034.01" data-end="1038.93">and lights that light it up so the</span> <span data-start="1038.93" data-end="1042.77">camera is a special in that it actually</span> <span data-start="1042.77" data-end="1045.8">it does the viewing part of filming your</span> <span data-start="1045.8" data-end="1049.58">scene so it can be positioned and</span> <span data-start="1049.58" data-end="1051.86">rotators like everything else on the</span> <span data-start="1051.86" data-end="1054.68">scene but it has something the field of</span> <span data-start="1054.68" data-end="1057.53">view which you might know from from</span> <span data-start="1057.53" data-end="1059.99">normal cameras which are basically just</span> <span data-start="1059.99" data-end="1062.54">two angles like the horizontal and the</span> <span data-start="1062.54" data-end="1065.39">vertical angle that open up that camera</span> <span data-start="1065.39" data-end="1068.75">view frustum like it's called in</span> <span data-start="1068.75" data-end="1069.66">addition to this</span> <span data-start="1069.66" data-end="1072.33">there's also an airplane and of our</span> <span data-start="1072.33" data-end="1076.83">plane which then define this cut off by</span> <span data-start="1076.83" data-end="1081.5">remote which is called the frustum so</span> <span data-start="1081.5" data-end="1085.41">putting all this together you see and</span> <span data-start="1085.41" data-end="1086.97">lower left for instance there are</span> <span data-start="1086.97" data-end="1089.97">several teapots and the coordinate</span> <span data-start="1089.97" data-end="1092.1">system that you can see there within</span> <span data-start="1092.1" data-end="1094.35">these teapots those are the object</span> <span data-start="1094.35" data-end="1098.22">spaces so all of those teapots are</span> <span data-start="1098.22" data-end="1100.16">basically identical they are just</span> <span data-start="1100.16" data-end="1106.2">rotated around on the scene so um the</span> <span data-start="1106.2" data-end="1108.21">difference between these three pictures</span> <span data-start="1108.21" data-end="1111.14">is just what the point of reference so</span> <span data-start="1111.14" data-end="1115.14">we can we can just view it in any way</span> <span data-start="1115.14" data-end="1117.3">you won't like if you use the world</span> <span data-start="1117.3" data-end="1119.73">space as a point of reference like in</span> <span data-start="1119.73" data-end="1122.7">the bottom left you have the camera</span> <span data-start="1122.7" data-end="1124.53">positioned according to the world space</span> <span data-start="1124.53" data-end="1127.68">and finally there is a view space that</span> <span data-start="1127.68" data-end="1130.95">is used by as a camera and so if you use</span> <span data-start="1130.95" data-end="1134.04">that as a reference you have coordinates</span> <span data-start="1134.04" data-end="1137.25">of the camera are 0 0 0 and everything</span> <span data-start="1137.25" data-end="1139.53">else is positioned related to the camera</span> <span data-start="1139.53" data-end="1142.61">and you can move between these different</span> <span data-start="1142.61" data-end="1145.44">systems using these matrix</span> <span data-start="1145.44" data-end="1148.11">multiplications I mentioned earlier this</span> <span data-start="1148.11" data-end="1150.81">is why you will find a lot of this</span> <span data-start="1150.81" data-end="1155.1">matrix stuff everywhere in every 3d</span> <span data-start="1155.1" data-end="1159.3">implementation then there is a one</span> <span data-start="1159.3" data-end="1161.19">interesting thing how do we do</span> <span data-start="1161.19" data-end="1165.24">perspective so um this is a really neat</span> <span data-start="1165.24" data-end="1170.01">trick so um if you see the left image we</span> <span data-start="1170.01" data-end="1172.77">have that view frustum and the regular</span> <span data-start="1172.77" data-end="1177.87">world coordinates and in order to do</span> <span data-start="1177.87" data-end="1180.57">those perspective so further away</span> <span data-start="1180.57" data-end="1184.11">objects are rendered smaller we simply</span> <span data-start="1184.11" data-end="1187.59">convert this frustum shape of pyramid</span> <span data-start="1187.59" data-end="1191.43">shape into a square and this the squares</span> <span data-start="1191.43" data-end="1195.27">is called the the club space or a</span> <span data-start="1195.27" data-end="1198.27">canonical view volume so all coordinates</span> <span data-start="1198.27" data-end="1201.53">are converted into into values between</span> <span data-start="1201.53" data-end="1204.169">minus 1 and 1</span> <span data-start="1204.169" data-end="1208.83">so um as the frustum defines everything</span> <span data-start="1208.83" data-end="1211.71">that camera can see so does this cube</span> <span data-start="1211.71" data-end="1214.26">and everything that is outside of the</span> <span data-start="1214.26" data-end="1217.409">value range from minus one to one simply</span> <span data-start="1217.409" data-end="1220.77">clipped and will not be visible and on</span> <span data-start="1220.77" data-end="1222.39">the same at the same time you can see</span> <span data-start="1222.39" data-end="1226.399">that uh that as teapot gets distorted</span> <span data-start="1226.399" data-end="1229.11">according to this prospector so if we</span> <span data-start="1229.11" data-end="1233.22">now just watch from left to right into</span> <span data-start="1233.22" data-end="1237.419">this cube we will see we will see the</span> <span data-start="1237.419" data-end="1241.309">perspective transformation taking place</span> <span data-start="1241.309" data-end="1244.47">the conversion from the left image to</span> <span data-start="1244.47" data-end="1247.409">right images done by once again matrix</span> <span data-start="1247.409" data-end="1249.149">multiplication which is called the</span> <span data-start="1249.149" data-end="1255.299">perspective transform so um now we have</span> <span data-start="1255.299" data-end="1257.61">all those paths together so let's talk</span> <span data-start="1257.61" data-end="1261.029">about the rendering algorithm first the</span> <span data-start="1261.029" data-end="1263.49">first step is we need to project all the</span> <span data-start="1263.49" data-end="1265.47">vertices into the canonical view volume</span> <span data-start="1265.47" data-end="1268.049">so we have them into the in this clip</span> <span data-start="1268.049" data-end="1271.98">space then we can start to assemble the</span> <span data-start="1271.98" data-end="1274.62">triangles rasterize up those triangles</span> <span data-start="1274.62" data-end="1276.6">like I explained earlier and then</span> <span data-start="1276.6" data-end="1279.149">finally we can compute the color value</span> <span data-start="1279.149" data-end="1283.649">for every of the fragments in that image</span> <span data-start="1283.649" data-end="1288.899">and yet last step fragment was the</span> <span data-start="1288.899" data-end="1291.84">special term for a pixel that is not yet</span> <span data-start="1291.84" data-end="1295.5">a pixel on screen but just corresponds</span> <span data-start="1295.5" data-end="1297.419">to a picture and as part of one of these</span> <span data-start="1297.419" data-end="1301.26">restaurants triangles so um last step is</span> <span data-start="1301.26" data-end="1304.2">to blend these color values in case</span> <span data-start="1304.2" data-end="1307.529">there's any transparency involved we</span> <span data-start="1307.529" data-end="1309.059">take the value that's already there and</span> <span data-start="1309.059" data-end="1311.22">put where you'll be computed and plant</span> <span data-start="1311.22" data-end="1315.899">them together so and this is what WebGL</span> <span data-start="1315.899" data-end="1319.679">basically does so we have a lot of a lot</span> <span data-start="1319.679" data-end="1322.649">of vertex data coming in with the rep</span> <span data-start="1322.649" data-end="1325.89">power the vertex buffer objects they are</span> <span data-start="1325.89" data-end="1328.049">named attributes and they they run into</span> <span data-start="1328.049" data-end="1330.6">the vertex shader which is the first of</span> <span data-start="1330.6" data-end="1332.399">those two shader programs that you can</span> <span data-start="1332.399" data-end="1336">write the vertex shader does does the</span> <span data-start="1336" data-end="1336.519">thing</span> <span data-start="1336.519" data-end="1339.07">which is basically just can compute the</span> <span data-start="1339.07" data-end="1342.19">club space Corps not been and there are</span> <span data-start="1342.19" data-end="1344.44">two stages called primitive assembly and</span> <span data-start="1344.44" data-end="1348.099">rasterization and finally the single</span> <span data-start="1348.099" data-end="1350.979">rough arrested fragments are passed on</span> <span data-start="1350.979" data-end="1352.779">to the fragment shader which will then</span> <span data-start="1352.779" data-end="1355.989">compute the color the color blending</span> <span data-start="1355.989" data-end="1358.869">happens and everything lands the frame</span> <span data-start="1358.869" data-end="1360.58">buffer of the graphics car which is</span> <span data-start="1360.58" data-end="1364.33">exactly what will be on screen so the</span> <span data-start="1364.33" data-end="1367.089">vertex shader computes the club space</span> <span data-start="1367.089" data-end="1371.609">coordinates and it gets the vertices in</span> <span data-start="1371.609" data-end="1375.179">something that's called attributes and</span> <span data-start="1375.179" data-end="1378.07">get some additional data I'll just call</span> <span data-start="1378.07" data-end="1383.259">uniforms and it can write output data in</span> <span data-start="1383.259" data-end="1385.509">form of varying variables which are</span> <span data-start="1385.509" data-end="1390.419">passed on to the vertex shader the</span> <span data-start="1390.419" data-end="1396.909">primitive assembly now we'll take this</span> <span data-start="1396.909" data-end="1401.07">computer vertex values in club space</span> <span data-start="1401.07" data-end="1403.149">assembler triangles rest of those</span> <span data-start="1403.149"

data-end="1414.759">triangle and then finally we can compute</span> <span data-start="1414.759" data-end="1417.369">the color so the fragment shader can</span> <span data-start="1417.369" data-end="1420.879">only access data that is pastored by by</span> <span data-start="1420.879" data-end="1422.889">the vertex shader doesn't matter too</span> <span data-start="1422.889" data-end="1429.849">much yeah the primary responsibility of</span> <span data-start="1429.849" data-end="1431.289">the fragment shaders to implement</span> <span data-start="1431.289"

data-end="1462.309">spectrum which make service bottle cap</span> <span data-start="1462.309" data-end="1465.099">here look blue for instance because</span> <span data-start="1465.099" data-end="1468.52">everything but blue color is absorbed</span> <span data-start="1468.52" data-end="1472.31">they can reflect light or light bounces</span> <span data-start="1472.31" data-end="1475.64">off the surface and finally there's a</span> <span data-start="1475.64" data-end="1477.95">possibility that there's a refraction of</span> <span data-start="1477.95" data-end="1482.6">a material is transparent it slightly</span> <span data-start="1482.6" data-end="1484.94">changes the lights direction which is</span> <span data-start="1484.94" data-end="1489.59">something you see you with lenses glass</span> <span data-start="1489.59" data-end="1493.88">surfaces and everything like that so in</span> <span data-start="1493.88" data-end="1499.13">the 3d world materials are basically</span> <span data-start="1499.13" data-end="1501.53">just what encapsulates all those all</span> <span data-start="1501.53" data-end="1504.32">those parameters that are required to</span> <span data-start="1504.32" data-end="1508.94">calculate the color so we have at least</span> <span data-start="1508.94" data-end="1512.15">one of the other one material per object</span> <span data-start="1512.15" data-end="1514.55">and we can have as many year as one</span> <span data-start="1514.55" data-end="1518.6">material / triangle so each of the</span> <span data-start="1518.6" data-end="1521.48">phases of the object can be rendered in</span> <span data-start="1521.48" data-end="1522.98">a different way with different</span> <span data-start="1522.98" data-end="1530.93">properties so there are some terms you</span> <span data-start="1530.93" data-end="1533.75">should have heard which are basically</span> <span data-start="1533.75" data-end="1536.21">just Lambert shading and the bloom phong</span> <span data-start="1536.21" data-end="1537.98">shading models those are the most</span> <span data-start="1537.98" data-end="1541.73">commonly used and shading models which</span> <span data-start="1541.73" data-end="1545.84">is basically just a simple equation not</span> <span data-start="1545.84" data-end="1548.33">so simple maybe but it's just an</span> <span data-start="1548.33" data-end="1552.07">equation that takes in light sources and</span> <span data-start="1552.07" data-end="1555.23">material properties like the the own</span> <span data-start="1555.23" data-end="1558.04">color of the material or the color of</span> <span data-start="1558.04" data-end="1562.04">reflected light and finally a calculus</span> <span data-start="1562.04" data-end="1564.95">from all these values together the final</span> <span data-start="1564.95" data-end="1567.8">color that you will see if you look at</span> <span data-start="1567.8" data-end="1570.47">that object from this direction at that</span> <span data-start="1570.47" data-end="1575.66">point so um the three used models here</span> <span data-start="1575.66" data-end="1578.75">there's basic which is just a plain</span> <span data-start="1578.75" data-end="1581.3">color independent of every light</span> <span data-start="1581.3" data-end="1585.14">influence lambo chatting does this is a</span> <span data-start="1585.14" data-end="1587.39">very simple and fast lighting equation</span> <span data-start="1587.39" data-end="1591.95">that can just have the few surfaces and</span> <span data-start="1591.95" data-end="1595.28">finally the foam material which can</span> <span data-start="1595.28" data-end="1599.24">properly render also specular highlights</span> <span data-start="1599.24" data-end="1600.58">so gloss</span> <span data-start="1600.58" data-end="1608.14">nose and stuff maybe so again the Beamer</span> <span data-start="1608.14" data-end="1615.039">sucks but as you can see here we have we</span> <span data-start="1615.039" data-end="1617.14">have for instance from from back to</span> <span data-start="1617.14" data-end="1620.34">front here on the the diffuse color</span> <span data-start="1620.34" data-end="1623.95">mount changes for instance so you can</span> <span data-start="1623.95" data-end="1626.679">see in the back the objects are</span> <span data-start="1626.679" data-end="1629.38">basically black and to the front they</span> <span data-start="1629.38" data-end="1631.6">get they get more and more intense red</span> <span data-start="1631.6" data-end="1634.57">then there's parameters like the</span> <span data-start="1634.57" data-end="1637">roughness of the material just a bit</span> <span data-start="1637" data-end="1641.74">hard to see but can see these specular</span> <span data-start="1641.74" data-end="1645.76">highlights here which are caused by the</span> <span data-start="1645.76" data-end="1648.21">material just not being very rough and</span> <span data-start="1648.21" data-end="1657.929">finally yeah I'm getting a bit stressed</span> <span data-start="1657.929" data-end="1662.2">so I'm texture Maps texture maps is last</span> <span data-start="1662.2" data-end="1666.73">point here and you can see it is</span> <span data-start="1666.73" data-end="1669.61">basically just way to paint images onto</span> <span data-start="1669.61" data-end="1673.09">all 3d objects so these are two simple</span> <span data-start="1673.09" data-end="1677.649">cubes and all phases of these cubes have</span> <span data-start="1677.649" data-end="1681.159">the same same picture of a side wall of</span> <span data-start="1681.159" data-end="1686.44">a box painted on them so we can use by</span> <span data-start="1686.44" data-end="1689.38">using texture maps we can use these</span> <span data-start="1689.38" data-end="1693.639">textures on to add further detail to our</span> <span data-start="1693.639" data-end="1696.49">objects without needing to specify all</span> <span data-start="1696.49" data-end="1698.95">of those in form of three angles and</span> <span data-start="1698.95" data-end="1702.039">colors of triangles so we can simply</span> <span data-start="1702.039" data-end="1705.22">draw an image onto an object surface so</span> <span data-start="1705.22" data-end="1707.47">this is the most common use cases it's</span> <span data-start="1707.47" data-end="1709.899">called diffuse mapping and there are</span> <span data-start="1709.899" data-end="1712.24">several other use cases possible for</span> <span data-start="1712.24" data-end="1715.799">like bump mapping or environment mapping</span> <span data-start="1715.799" data-end="1718.6">alpha mapping so iphone mapping would</span> <span data-start="1718.6" data-end="1721.6">describe how how transparent an object</span> <span data-start="1721.6" data-end="1723.549">would be at a specific point of its</span> <span data-start="1723.549" data-end="1727.139">surface bump mapping describes tiny</span> <span data-start="1727.139" data-end="1729.73">details of the object surface I have an</span> <span data-start="1729.73" data-end="1733.02">example for the environment web mapping</span> <span data-start="1733.02" data-end="1735.45">is something that we need in order to</span> <span data-start="1735.45" data-end="1738.42">describe reflection because the object</span> <span data-start="1738.42" data-end="1740.34">needs to know about its environment in</span> <span data-start="1740.34" data-end="1745.04">order to have something to reflect so</span> <span data-start="1745.04" data-end="1749.1">it's all bit difficult to put into the</span> <span data-start="1749.1" data-end="1752.88">30 minutes I see finally one important</span> <span data-start="1752.88" data-end="1756.47">term here is a UV mapping the UV mapping</span> <span data-start="1756.47" data-end="1763.38">the process of describing how a part of</span> <span data-start="1763.38" data-end="1766.82">your texture image maps to the geometry</span> <span data-start="1766.82" data-end="1770.13">so a UV map is something that you</span> <span data-start="1770.13" data-end="1772.85">definitely need an order to put this</span> <span data-start="1772.85" data-end="1774.69">two-dimensional image on for your</span> <span data-start="1774.69" data-end="1778.08">three-dimensional geometry and as</span> <span data-start="1778.08" data-end="1780.84">promised here is this is an example of</span> <span data-start="1780.84" data-end="1784.26">what what is very simple material can do</span> <span data-start="1784.26" data-end="1788.46">if you just add a bump map so you can</span> <span data-start="1788.46" data-end="1794.16">see here all those detail all this tiny</span> <span data-start="1794.16" data-end="1798.39">tiny specks in the face are simply</span> <span data-start="1798.39" data-end="1801.48">caused by adding a bump map which shows</span> <span data-start="1801.48" data-end="1807.18">how a bit of a displacement how the how</span> <span data-start="1807.18" data-end="1814.13">the face is detailed yeah and finally a</span> <span data-start="1814.13" data-end="1820.65">no time for questions but yeah just find</span> <span data-start="1820.65" data-end="1827.33">me outside thanks for listening</span> </p>
