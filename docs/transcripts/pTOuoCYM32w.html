data-end="290.83">better but there's still just like</span> <span data-start="290.83" data-end="292.72">little parts of the same overall puzzle</span> <span data-start="292.72" data-end="295.3">so in the last three months I've kind of</span> <span data-start="295.3" data-end="297.37">focus taking a step back and focused on</span> <span data-start="297.37" data-end="300.01">the greater picture of

data-start="306.82" data-end="308.01">doesn't really get you there</span> <span data-start="308.01" data-end="310.09">so what do we talk about when we said in</span> <span data-start="310.09" data-end="312.94">node why I kind of broke down this</span> <span data-start="312.94" data-end="315.64">philosophy there this is these guiding</span> <span data-start="315.64" data-end="317.02">principles as I came to understand them</span> <span data-start="317.02" data-end="320.56">into three sections structure async and</span> <span data-start="320.56" data-end="324.79">community they're about thrifty 15</span> <span data-start="324.79" data-end="326.62">points and all but I mean I don't have</span> <span data-start="326.62" data-end="327.76">too much time so I'll just go over the</span> <span data-start="327.76" data-end="331.18">basic ones structure being that node</span> <span data-start="331.18" data-end="333.13">really doesn't provide you that much in</span> <span data-start="333.13" data-end="334.54">terms of structure it really kind of</span> <span data-start="334.54" data-end="336.85">leaves you on your own which is powerful</span> <span data-start="336.85" data-end="338.29">but also kind of scary especially as you</span> <span data-start="338.29" data-end="340.27">start out what is a good module what is</span> <span

data-end="346.27">yourself from making easy mistakes async</span> <span data-start="346.27" data-end="349.15">is the reason most of us really find the</span> <span data-start="349.15" data-end="351.64">langar the framework why most of us</span> <span data-start="351.64" data-end="353.11">start using though it is for those kind</span> <span data-start="353.11" data-end="356.17">of powerful async just ways of doing</span> <span data-start="356.17" data-end="358">things but it's also kind of the</span> <span data-start="358" data-end="360.01">trickiest part of node it's definitely</span> <span data-start="360.01" data-end="361.09">the thing that I got tripped on the most</span> <span data-start="361.09" data-end="362.38">when I started and everyone else who</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.38" data-end="364.21">I've kind of brought on board our team</span> <span data-start="364.21" data-end="366.97">it's easily the most kind of sticking</span> <span data-start="366.97" data-end="369.58">point as you get started so how do you</span> <span data-start="369.58" data-end="371.71">not make the same mistakes not end up in</span> <span data-start="371.71" data-end="374.08">callback hell how do you just do better</span> <span data-start="374.08" data-end="378.61">and then a community I would bet anyone</span> <span data-start="378.61" data-end="380.08">a million dollars it is impossible to</span> <span data-start="380.08" data-end="383.44">write node in a vacuum just impossible</span> <span data-start="383.44" data-end="385.15">you you need the community you're gonna</span> <span data-start="385.15" data-end="387.03">find yourself on github on NPM</span> <span data-start="387.03" data-end="389.47">installing things reading documentation</span> <span data-start="389.47" data-end="392.26">there's no way around that NPM and the</span> <span data-start="392.26" data-end="393.82">ecosystem and the community are all part</span> <span data-start="393.82" data-end="396.07">of node and note is part of that so how</span> <span data-start="396.07" data-end="397.39">does that influence the framework and</span> <span data-start="397.39" data-end="398.53">the and the work we do</span> <span data-start="398.53" data-end="401.41">so um so just a quick overview of each</span> <span data-start="401.41" data-end="403.36">of these three points um there's a lot</span> <span data-start="403.36" data-end="405.31">more of it on the website that I've kind</span> <span data-start="405.31" data-end="406.84">of put up to go through this which I</span> <span data-start="406.84" data-end="408.4">haven't really shown anyone so I think</span> <span

data-end="414.58">but um I'll include a link to that at</span> <span data-start="414.58" data-end="416.08">the end and so let's talk about</span> <span data-start="416.08" data-end="417.37">structure</span> <span data-start="417.37" data-end="419.95">like I said node really doesn't give you</span> <span data-start="419.95" data-end="422.62">much it's basically just you

<span data-start="427.36" data-end="429.1">it really don't give you much but from</span> <span data-start="429.1" data-end="430.9">that you can create these huge or maybe</span> <span data-start="430.9" data-end="435.52">not huge but powerful applications so so</span> <span data-start="435.52" data-end="436.81">how do you kind of stop yourself from</span> <span data-start="436.81" data-end="439.9">shooting yourself in the foot this is</span> <span data-start="439.9" data-end="441.16">what most people mean when they say the</span> <span data-start="441.16" data-end="442.51">node the node way or at least one of the</span> <span data-start="442.51" data-end="445.66">main kind of two things build small</span> <span data-start="445.66" data-end="448.96">single purpose modules the

<span data-start="452.49" data-end="455.62">struck me the most is that especially</span> <span data-start="455.62" data-end="457.15">coming from the front end you use jQuery</span> <span

that's kind of the selling point</span> <span data-start="620.08" data-end="621.94">almost but at the same time it's also</span> <span data-start="621.94" data-end="625.09">it's also very tricky so you have to be</span> <span data-start="625.09" data-end="625.99">careful you have to leverage i/o</span> <span data-start="625.99" data-end="627.73">whenever you can that's really how you</span>

let's say on a normal rail</span> <span data-start="644.29" data-end="646.75">server like the like what I mentioned</span> <span data-start="646.75" data-end="649.48">before you want to parse this

data-end="678.97">are blocking yourself without even</span> <span data-start="678.97" data-end="681.279">noticing so avoid that at all at all</span> <span data-start="681.279" data-end="683.83">times

data-end="759.43">um you know there's a lot of kind of</span> <span data-start="759.43" data-end="761.25">promises verse callbacks or you know</span> <span data-start="761.25" data-end="764.47">there's a lot of flame there but really</span> <span data-start="764.47" data-end="766.24">no matter what you want to get help with</span> <span data-start="766.24" data-end="767.77">you should especially to get into the</span> <span data-start="767.77" data-end="769.75">kind of higher-order stuff like how do</span> <span data-start="769.75" data-end="771.67">you

of</span> <span data-start="780.22" data-end="781.69">writing your own because those bugs are</span> <span data-start="781.69" data-end="782.459">hard to track down</span> <span data-start="782.459" data-end="785.44">so the async helper module really good</span> <span data-start="785.44" data-end="787.18">at that promises are good that whatever</span> <span data-start="787.18" data-end="789.91">you want to use use it don't be afraid</span> <span data-start="789.91" data-end="794.22">to get help and lastly community</span> <span data-start="794.22" data-end="797.38">community is a huge part of of node the</span> <span data-start="797.38" data-end="799.5">ecosystem is huge one of the biggest</span> <span data-start="799.5" data-end="802.92">is it the biggest now yeah wait wait</span> <span data-start="802.92" data-end="804.69">wait that's all there so it's this huge</span> <span data-start="804.69" data-end="806.67">kind of ecosystem and then the community</span> <span data-start="806.67" data-end="809.25">is just so kind of involved with each</span> <span data-start="809.25" data-end="810.51">other I mean you're all here this is</span> <span data-start="810.51" data-end="811.43">awesome</span> <span data-start="811.43" data-end="813.51">so whenever possible leverage the</span> <span data-start="813.51" data-end="816.12">ecosystem or

<span data-start="843.18" data-end="844.44">contribute back to the community what's</span> <span data-start="844.44" data-end="846.56">already there and make everything better</span> <span data-start="846.56" data-end="850.95">before going out on your own also read</span> <span data-start="850.95" data-end="852.51">out modules for others to use I think</span> <span data-start="852.51" data-end="854.25">it's really easy especially in other</span> <span data-start="854.25" data-end="855.69">languages again this world oh you're the</span> <span data-start="855.69" data-end="858.48">only person using this your this is your</span> <span data-start="858.48" data-end="860.64">team's code and that's it and they all</span> <span data-start="860.64" data-end="861.66">know this one thing that you've learned</span> <span data-start="861.66" data-end="863.91">two years ago so no need to document</span> <span data-start="863.91" data-end="866.61">that but with the ecosystem and was</span> <span data-start="866.61" data-end="868.77">working with so many other people you</span> <span data-start="868.77" data-end="871.05">really need to kind of build for the</span> <span data-start="871.05" data-end="872.31">stranger built for the guy who just</span> <span data-start="872.31" data-end="874.74">found your your module just on

data-start="882.93" data-end="885.03">of just kind of thought put into that</span> <span data-start="885.03" data-end="888.33">and the ecosystem as a whole so whenever</span> <span data-start="888.33" data-end="889.56">possible try and write modules for</span> <span data-start="889.56" data-end="891.27">others to use write your code for others</span> <span data-start="891.27" data-end="893.339">to

data-start="906.48" data-end="910.89">awesome but also like on github NPM</span> <span data-start="910.89" data-end="913.11">people are always always talking to each</span> <span data-start="913.11" data-end="916.08">other talking about stuff the IO Jas</span> <span data-start="916.08" data-end="917.64">thing is pulling everyone back into node</span> <span data-start="917.64" data-end="918.77">which is great</span> <span data-start="918.77" data-end="920.64">just don't be afraid to reach out to</span> <span data-start="920.64" data-end="922.23">people on Twitter anything
