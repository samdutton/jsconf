data-end="120.63">how do we accomplish these things what</span> <span data-start="120.63" data-end="123.99">tools we use to improve collaboration is</span> <span data-start="123.99"

to</span> <span data-start="137.819" data-end="139.56">preface this this isn't the agile</span> <span data-start="139.56" data-end="143.54">manifesto I this is just my opinion and</span> <span data-start="143.54" data-end="146.34">we we pride ourselves in changing our</span> <span data-start="146.34" data-end="149.31">process a lot if you know we might have</span> <span data-start="149.31" data-end="150.959">a few sprint plantings we're just like</span> <span data-start="150.959" data-end="152.13">you know what this isn't working anymore</span> <span data-start="152.13" data-end="155.37">and we things up so this is kind of like</span> <span data-start="155.37" data-end="157.739">the culmination of of what we've</span> <span data-start="157.739" data-end="159.2">experienced over the past couple years</span> <span data-start="159.2" data-end="161.43">some of my experiences working at other</span> <span data-start="161.43" data-end="166.85">organizations so again just my opinion</span> <span data-start="166.85" data-end="169.47">so to answer that first question where</span> <span data-start="169.47" data-end="171.72">does design go it's a tough question</span> <span data-start="171.72" data-end="173.88">product managers designers developers we</span> <span data-start="173.88" data-end="176.12">all struggle with it where does it go a</span> <span data-start="176.12" data-end="179.16">lot of deb shops you now use agile of</span> <span data-start="179.16" data-end="181.47">course and it's usually a developer</span> <span data-start="181.47" data-end="185.099">introduced process and it usually winds</span> <span data-start="185.099" data-end="187.47">up living in development so as an</span> <span data-start="187.47" data-end="189.12">outsider the designer coming in it's</span> <span data-start="189.12" data-end="191.099">kind of hard to find that sweet spot of</span> <span data-start="191.099" data-end="195.239">like so where do I fit in on this so I'm</span> <span data-start="195.239" data-end="196.89">going to hopefully answer that a little</span> <span data-start="196.89" data-end="200.579">bit better we know it shouldn't go at</span> <span data-start="200.579" data-end="202.59">the end I think we've been beaten the</span> <span data-start="202.59" data-end="204.39">over the head with that enough where if</span> <span data-start="204.39" data-end="206.04">you're leading designed to be that</span> <span data-start="206.04" data-end="207.9">little like little bit of lipstick at</span> <span data-start="207.9" data-end="209.43">the end a little bit of Polish that you</span> <span data-start="209.43" data-end="211.41">want to pretty things up ah it doesn't</span> <span data-start="211.41" data-end="213.989">really work so I'm not going to dwell on</span> <span data-start="213.989" data-end="217.92">that too much so that can only say the</span> <span data-start="217.92" data-end="219.9">beginning right and it feels good I'm</span> <span data-start="219.9" data-end="221.22">going to start off with design we're</span> <span data-start="221.22" data-end="222.18">doing you're right we're thinking about</span> <span data-start="222.18" data-end="224.609">the problem first we're going to do the</span> <span data-start="224.609" data-end="225.75">mock-ups and then we're going to hand it</span> <span data-start="225.75" data-end="228.48">off and we're going to build it but this</span> <span data-start="228.48" data-end="230.16">is actually kind of where I see the</span> <span data-start="230.16" data-end="232.17">process fell apart a lot because the</span> <span data-start="232.17" data-end="234.54">expectation generally is designer and</span> <span data-start="234.54" data-end="236.88">the product manager go off look at the</span> <span data-start="236.88" data-end="241.53">research do interviews with users do</span> <span data-start="241.53" data-end="244.799">some wire frames makeup to mock ups then</span> <span data-start="244.799" data-end="246.239">that got to hand it off the developers</span> <span data-start="246.239" data-end="247.889">create some stories get those assigned</span> <span data-start="247.889" data-end="250.17">and it gets built and it's usually about</span> <span data-start="250.17" data-end="252.6">this time when the designer stops that</span> <span data-start="252.6" data-end="254.069">on that feature and goes works on the</span> <span data-start="254.069" data-end="257.01">next one something that I had struggled</span> <span data-start="257.01" data-end="259.049">with a lot was the idea of having to</span> <span data-start="259.049" data-end="261.169">keep one sprint ahead of the developers</span> <span data-start="261.169" data-end="263.49">and that was really really challenging a</span> <span data-start="263.49" data-end="266.37">because it expected that that work could</span> <span data-start="266.37" data-end="267.18">be done</span> <span data-start="267.18" data-end="269.639">you know in a sprint right ahead but</span> <span data-start="269.639" data-end="270.57">then it didn't really give that</span> <span data-start="270.57" data-end="273.06">opportunity to continue working on that</span> <span data-start="273.06" data-end="277.139">initial feature so yeah so what's what's</span> <span data-start="277.139" data-end="278.4">the problem with I won't i kind of just</span> <span data-start="278.4" data-end="282.12">explained that sorry but the i think</span> <span data-start="282.12" data-end="283.71">that what what generally happens with</span> <span data-start="283.71" data-end="285.9">this is the designers original intent</span> <span data-start="285.9" data-end="288.389">might not carry through to the end</span> <span data-start="288.389" data-end="291.06">product and that's not the developers</span> <span data-start="291.06" data-end="294.09">fault at all everything is done with a</span> <span data-start="294.09" data-end="296.97">series of best guesses right designers</span> <span data-start="296.97" data-end="298.41">will do mock-ups based on the</span> <span data-start="298.41" data-end="300.389">information they have at the time to</span> <span data-start="300.389" data-end="301.53">give it to the developers developers</span> <span data-start="301.53" data-end="303">have different information they have</span> <span data-start="303" data-end="305.19">technical reasons why something can or</span> <span data-start="305.19" data-end="307.68">can't happen they run into other Road</span> <span data-start="307.68" data-end="309.12">bloxorz other bugs there's other</span> <span data-start="309.12" data-end="313.62">priorities that come up so to make the</span> <span data-start="313.62" data-end="315.06">assumption that we can figure out the</span> <span data-start="315.06" data-end="317.28">design at the beginning and then it gets</span> <span data-start="317.28" data-end="319.53">just you know the perfect product comes</span> <span data-start="319.53" data-end="321.449">out at the end well it's it's a</span> <span data-start="321.449" data-end="324.27">challenging one so all right where does</span> <span data-start="324.27" data-end="327.419">it go might not like where this is</span> <span data-start="327.419" data-end="330.389">leading but it's kind of everywhere and</span> <span data-start="330.389" data-end="331.62">that's easy for me to say and the</span> <span data-start="331.62" data-end="333.27">designers standing up here saying design</span> <span data-start="333.27" data-end="335.58">should be everywhere well development</span> <span data-start="335.58" data-end="337.65">should be everywhere too I think it's</span> <span data-start="337.65" data-end="339.9">really a product building Express it's</span> <span data-start="339.9" data-end="341.55">not a dev process it's not a design</span> <span data-start="341.55" data-end="344.159">process so I've been home we really try</span> <span data-start="344.159" data-end="346.4">to make this about the product</span> <span data-start="346.4" data-end="348.06">development starts at the beginning</span> <span data-start="348.06" data-end="350.25">design starts at the beginning and we</span> <span data-start="350.25" data-end="353.52">work our way through it so let me</span> <span data-start="353.52" data-end="355.26">explain how we actually go about doing</span> <span data-start="355.26" data-end="357.63">this so how do we put design everywhere</span> <span data-start="357.63" data-end="361.02">for starters we assign our features to a</span> <span data-start="361.02" data-end="364.74">designer and developer pair board our</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="364.74" data-end="366.87">CTO just pointed out to me it's like</span> <span data-start="366.87" data-end="368.19">yeah we actually have two designers and</span> <span data-start="368.19" data-end="370.65">one developer we're not counting you of</span> <span data-start="370.65" data-end="373.86">course we have another one so but that's</span> <span data-start="373.86" data-end="375.09">that's actually kind of an interesting</span> <span data-start="375.09" data-end="377.52">thing and we're building a tool that</span> <span data-start="377.52" data-end="380.159">looks at your code it's kind of neat</span> <span data-start="380.159" data-end="383.539">though so we we assign the feature and</span> <span data-start="383.539" data-end="386.46">the expectation is we don't really go</span> <span data-start="386.46" data-end="388.53">dive deep into what that feature is</span> <span data-start="388.53" data-end="390.3">supposed to do at the time we let the</span> <span data-start="390.3" data-end="393.33">pair figure that out and that what that</span> <span data-start="393.33" data-end="395.37">kind of means is just from the get-go</span> <span data-start="395.37" data-end="397.409">there aren't necessarily too many</span> <span data-start="397.409" data-end="398.74">assumptions about what it</span> <span data-start="398.74" data-end="402.58">look like we start by looking at the</span> <span data-start="402.58" data-end="404.8">data so a lot of our features will</span> <span data-start="404.8" data-end="406.93">actually start with a route that outputs</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="406.93" data-end="409.569">JSON or you know not even maybe it's</span> <span data-start="409.569" data-end="411.97">just something we we throw in slack and</span> <span data-start="411.97" data-end="414.669">that's where we start discussing it and</span> <span data-start="414.669" data-end="416.91">what this does is gets rid of that</span> <span data-start="416.91" data-end="420.699">paradigm of the designer using perfect</span> <span data-start="420.699" data-end="422.86">data to do these perfect mock-ups and</span> <span data-start="422.86" data-end="425.02">everything looks beautiful but once you</span> <span data-start="425.02" data-end="426.759">start plugging in real data you realize</span> <span data-start="426.759" data-end="429.4">that falls apart really quickly so we</span> <span data-start="429.4" data-end="431.53">start with the data so that anything</span> <span data-start="431.53" data-end="433.419">that we do from a design perspective is</span> <span data-start="433.419" data-end="435.569">already looking at real world</span> <span data-start="435.569" data-end="438.37">circumstances and that really that</span> <span data-start="438.37" data-end="441.88">really helps out a lot we don't define a</span> <span data-start="441.88" data-end="444.069">handoff stage where you know once</span> <span data-start="444.069" data-end="446.05">designs done developers take over of</span> <span data-start="446.05" data-end="449.319">course it happens but it's never it's</span> <span data-start="449.319" data-end="451.479">never the same for for any given feature</span> <span data-start="451.479" data-end="456.61">so and like I said there there would the</span> <span data-start="456.61" data-end="458.68">handoff might actually happen multiple</span> <span data-start="458.68" data-end="461.56">times designed to Deb back the design</span> <span data-start="461.56" data-end="466.03">and it's a iterative process another</span> <span data-start="466.03" data-end="468.969">little trick up our sleeves is we we</span> <span data-start="468.969" data-end="472.75">like designers who code so where we code</span> <span data-start="472.75" data-end="475.33">enough to be dangerous so you can really</span> <span data-start="475.33" data-end="477.4">probably call us front-end developers</span> <span data-start="477.4" data-end="478.96">that's probably what we would be called</span> <span data-start="478.96" data-end="480.94">in a lot of organizations but we</span> <span data-start="480.94" data-end="483.699">definitely lean towards the aesthetic</span> <span data-start="483.699" data-end="486.639">the experience side so weird that first</span> <span data-start="486.639" data-end="491.02">run at second but given how closely we</span> <span data-start="491.02" data-end="492.94">work with our developers that's a very</span> <span data-start="492.94" data-end="496.96">nice compliment what this also helps</span> <span data-start="496.96" data-end="498.729">with which you might appreciate is those</span> <span data-start="498.729" data-end="503.11">pixel perfect mind-numbing alterations</span> <span data-start="503.11" data-end="504.789">that the designer wants to do well we do</span> <span data-start="504.789" data-end="507.58">that ourselves so hopefully that leaves</span> <span data-start="507.58" data-end="510.219">the the more interesting and more</span> <span data-start="510.219" data-end="514.029">complicated dev work available so you're</span> <span data-start="514.029" data-end="515.909">not getting annoyed by us all the time</span> <span data-start="515.909" data-end="519.07">so developers help with design problems</span> <span data-start="519.07" data-end="522.55">that's that's how we do it designers</span> <span data-start="522.55" data-end="525.52">help with Deb problems and we we do do a</span> <span data-start="525.52" data-end="527.11">lot of pair programming but it's often</span> <span data-start="527.11" data-end="529.06">with the designer and the developer</span> <span data-start="529.06" data-end="530.98">which is really neat and we both learn</span> <span data-start="530.98" data-end="532.18">so much</span> <span data-start="532.18" data-end="537.18">from that process oh so that's top tools</span> <span data-start="537.18" data-end="540.73">and i don't mean the designers i mean</span> <span data-start="540.73" data-end="543.61">like apps and stuff the ones that we use</span> <span data-start="543.61" data-end="546.76">to help us do this process better so to</span> <span

data-end="556.93">like well i'm not supposed to use that</span> <span data-start="556.93" data-end="557.83">so i'm not going to bother learning</span> <span data-start="557.83" data-end="561.37">about it so we we try to find as many</span> <span data-start="561.37" data-end="566.709">many ways to level that playing field we</span> <span data-start="566.709" data-end="569.38">we use pull requests kind of like how</span> <span data-start="569.38" data-end="571.51">github I don't know if they still do but</span> <span data-start="571.51" data-end="573.1">this is what they used to do there's</span> <span data-start="573.1" data-end="575.29">presentation called how github uses</span> <span data-start="575.29" data-end="578.41">github to build github and we kind of</span> <span data-start="578.41" data-end="580.029">modeled our process around that and that</span> <span data-start="580.029" data-end="581.86">is you open a PO request the moment you</span> <span data-start="581.86" data-end="584.02">start on a future versus it's just the</span> <span data-start="584.02" data-end="585.339">thing that you do at the end to review</span> <span data-start="585.339" data-end="588.3">the code and what that lets us do is is</span> <span data-start="588.3" data-end="590.38">embed discussion into the pull request</span> <span data-start="590.38" data-end="592.99">we have this thread of comments we put</span> <span data-start="592.99" data-end="594.88">mock-ups in there we put all sorts of</span> <span data-start="594.88" data-end="596.44">things we use it to review code of</span> <span data-start="596.44" data-end="599.2">course and it gives us kind of a</span> <span data-start="599.2" data-end="601.51">historical backlog of how a feature got</span> <span data-start="601.51" data-end="604.12">developed and we tend to work very</span> <span data-start="604.12" data-end="606.31">closely in office together but whenever</span> <span data-start="606.31" data-end="608.83">travel does happen this is a perfect way</span> <span data-start="608.83" data-end="611.2">for us to stay on top of things but the</span> <span data-start="611.2" data-end="612.82">fact that design is in those pull</span> <span data-start="612.82" data-end="615.22">requests from the beginning also means</span> <span data-start="615.22" data-end="617.02">that towards the end of the review</span> <span data-start="617.02" data-end="619.029">process design is also involved and they</span> <span data-start="619.029" data-end="620.65">know everybody is on the same page about</span> <span data-start="620.65" data-end="626.67">what's going on your issue tracker I</span> <span data-start="626.67" data-end="628.99">included this because I i went to a</span> <span data-start="628.99" data-end="632.11">design meetup months ago and I asked to</span> <span data-start="632.11" data-end="634.54">designers about what issue tracker they</span> <span data-start="634.54" data-end="636.76">use that at their companies and they</span> <span data-start="636.76" data-end="638.41">kind of just grumbled and said oh I</span> <span data-start="638.41" data-end="640.69">don't know the developers use pivotal we</span> <span data-start="640.69" data-end="643.24">don't usually touch that which I kind of</span> <span data-start="643.24" data-end="644.92">found found interesting is like why not</span> <span data-start="644.92" data-end="646.66">that's perfect way for you guys to</span> <span data-start="646.66" data-end="648.88">collaborate with development put new</span> <span data-start="648.88" data-end="652.63">ideas down initiate discussion so I</span> <span data-start="652.63" data-end="654.97">actually see the issue tracker is just</span> <span data-start="654.97" data-end="656.35">as much as design tool as a development</span> <span data-start="656.35" data-end="658.87">and it's great for great for that</span> <span data-start="658.87" data-end="663.76">conversation so for designers who are</span> <span data-start="663.76" data-end="665.11">just dangerous enough with</span> <span data-start="665.11" data-end="670.95">ode get is a very daunting roadblock a</span> <span data-start="670.95" data-end="673.42">involves the command line so it's</span> <span data-start="673.42" data-end="675.99">already you kind of lost most designers</span> <span data-start="675.99" data-end="681.25">and so once you're you know you want to</span> <span data-start="681.25" data-end="682.81">play around with code but then get kind</span> <span data-start="682.81" data-end="686.29">of gets in the way so you must have I'm</span> <span data-start="686.29" data-end="688.42">sure there's a onboarding process to</span> <span data-start="688.42" data-end="690.97">share your your best practices with new</span> <span data-start="690.97" data-end="693.399">hires when it comes to your get process</span> <span data-start="693.399" data-end="695.98">and i encourage you to include designers</span> <span data-start="695.98" data-end="698.89">in that as well there's a there's a GUI</span> <span data-start="698.89" data-end="700.72">app called tower for the mac that is</span> <span data-start="700.72" data-end="703.18">brilliant for this that's how i got to</span> <span data-start="703.18" data-end="705.43">understand get i now use it on the</span> <span data-start="705.43" data-end="706.839">command line but i still use tower for</span> <span data-start="706.839" data-end="707.98">certain things because just does it</span> <span data-start="707.98" data-end="711.209">better Oh at least I feel it does better</span> <span data-start="711.209" data-end="715.12">so get them comfortable and get your</span> <span data-start="715.12" data-end="716.98">local dev environment should be friendly</span> <span data-start="716.98" data-end="719.29">and this is obviously could be said for</span> <span data-start="719.29" data-end="722.829">both designers and developers the moment</span> <span data-start="722.829" data-end="725.32">again any barrier that might prevent</span> <span data-start="725.32" data-end="726.88">somebody from pittle fiddling around</span> <span data-start="726.88" data-end="728.829">with with code from prototyping</span> <span data-start="728.829" data-end="731.5">something it's just an excuse to say you</span> <span data-start="731.5" data-end="733.48">know what hey not really my job I guess</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="733.48" data-end="735.579">I'm going to stick to doing some</span> <span data-start="735.579" data-end="738.94">mock-ups and sketch or Photoshop so a</span> <span data-start="738.94" data-end="742">bit helm i love i love our local dev</span> <span data-start="742" data-end="744.399">environment it takes those commands to</span> <span data-start="744.399" data-end="748">get running board did a talk about how</span> <span data-start="748" data-end="751.899">we how we get from zero deploy request</span> <span data-start="751.899" data-end="754">and by noon or buy lunch something like</span> <span data-start="754" data-end="757.899">that and it's totally doable so the the</span> <span data-start="757.899" data-end="760">easier it is to get up and running the</span> <span data-start="760" data-end="761.56">less of a barrier of course it is to</span> <span data-start="761.56" data-end="765.61">start fiddling with some code this this</span> <span data-start="765.61" data-end="770.43">kind of seems like a like a simple idea</span> <span data-start="770.43" data-end="773.35">use old-school tools and but it's</span> <span data-start="773.35" data-end="774.67">actually quite powerful when you think</span> <span data-start="774.67" data-end="777.25">about use a chalkboard or you use a</span> <span data-start="777.25" data-end="780.73">whiteboard or paper whatever and there's</span> <span data-start="780.73" data-end="782.92">no pretenses behind well that's a design</span> <span data-start="782.92" data-end="785.529">tool or that's a developer tool no it's</span> <span data-start="785.529" data-end="787.48">it's just that it's a thing it's a tool</span> <span data-start="787.48" data-end="790.06">and we use them extensively we use them</span> <span data-start="790.06" data-end="792.97">for our sprint planning we you we do our</span> <span data-start="792.97" data-end="795.19">to-do lists on there we do our mock-ups</span> <span data-start="795.19" data-end="797.529">on there and it's very common to see</span> <span data-start="797.529" data-end="798.29">will</span> <span data-start="798.29" data-end="799.82">have a design element mocked up and</span> <span data-start="799.82" data-end="801.38">right next to it the data structure of</span> <span data-start="801.38" data-end="802.91">the data that's going to populate those</span> <span data-start="802.91" data-end="805.25">elements so that discussion happens from</span> <span data-start="805.25" data-end="809.63">the get-go javascript is the best I</span> <span data-start="809.63" data-end="811.399">don't have to tell you this you're here</span> <span data-start="811.399" data-end="813.709">for a reason but i'll give you the</span> <span data-start="813.709" data-end="816.5">designers perspective of why javascript</span> <span data-start="816.5" data-end="820.31">is awesome for this this includes jquery</span> <span data-start="820.31" data-end="821.93">and I know I've and I've heard it</span> <span data-start="821.93" data-end="824.089">firsthand where it's like we want</span> <span data-start="824.089" data-end="827.06">developers who do javascript and no not</span> <span data-start="827.06" data-end="829.04">jquery and it's like well hold on a</span> <span data-start="829.04" data-end="833.36">minute jquery is I think the best</span> <span data-start="833.36" data-end="836.139">language to orb language sorry framework</span> <span data-start="836.139" data-end="840.23">that bridges what's happening in the</span> <span data-start="840.23" data-end="842.12">browser to code and it's something as</span> <span data-start="842.12" data-end="844.1">designers it's really easy to understand</span> <span data-start="844.1" data-end="846.199">and I've tried PHP I looked at</span> <span data-start="846.199" data-end="849.199">objective-c million zillion times and</span> <span data-start="849.199" data-end="852.949">gave up on that those never took jquery</span> <span data-start="852.949" data-end="856.55">it was very easy to grasp very easy to</span> <span data-start="856.55" data-end="859.19">start prototyping in it which brings me</span> <span data-start="859.19" data-end="861.35">to prototyping I mean that's great again</span> <span data-start="861.35" data-end="864.29">you know this designers might not open</span> <span data-start="864.29" data-end="866.66">up the Dom inspector I mean I've I know</span> <span data-start="866.66" data-end="868.579">how many times I've done this too it</span> <span data-start="868.579" data-end="870.68">doesn't look as designer and said like</span> <span data-start="870.68" data-end="872.769">even if you just wanted to change text</span> <span data-start="872.769" data-end="875.06">you can do it like this and then their</span> <span data-start="875.06" data-end="877.639">eyes just light up and never mind the</span> <span data-start="877.639" data-end="879.35">things you can actually do with with</span> <span data-start="879.35" data-end="881.209">actual animation and they're all that</span> <span data-start="881.209" data-end="883.399">kind of stuff so javascript is it's</span> <span data-start="883.399" data-end="886.22">perfect for prototyping a lot of our</span> <span data-start="886.22" data-end="888.47">features start as hockey prototypes like</span> <span data-start="888.47" data-end="892.399">this and they that's they get cleaned up</span> <span data-start="892.399" data-end="894.43">but that's eventually what gets chipped</span> <span data-start="894.43" data-end="898.31">and it's even better when you're using</span> <span data-start="898.31" data-end="902.12">nodes so for my personal experience I</span> <span data-start="902.12" data-end="904.88">knew a little bit of jQuery I got better</span> <span data-start="904.88" data-end="907.79">at just vanilla JavaScript and then I</span> <span data-start="907.79" data-end="910.37">started to understand the backend a lot</span> <span data-start="910.37" data-end="914.769">better it's one language I got it and</span> <span data-start="914.769" data-end="916.97">again that's just a powerful thing to</span> <span data-start="916.97" data-end="921.38">arm somebody with when when it usually</span> <span data-start="921.38" data-end="925.579">it's just a very daunting task so can</span> <span data-start="925.579" data-end="927.05">you have too much of a good thing is</span> <span data-start="927.05" data-end="929.6">there too much crossover that happens</span> <span data-start="929.6" data-end="931.379">between design of development and there</span> <span data-start="931.379" data-end="934.049">it's absolutely there is something that</span> <span data-start="934.049" data-end="937.829">the designers that at Midtown often</span> <span data-start="937.829" data-end="939.72">struggle with is getting caught up in</span> <span data-start="939.72" data-end="941.069">the challenge of trying to figure</span> <span data-start="941.069" data-end="944.22">something out so after about the sixth</span> <span data-start="944.22" data-end="946.499">hour trying to scour stackoverflow for</span> <span data-start="946.499" data-end="949.319">an answer I asked a developer and I get</span> <span data-start="949.319" data-end="952.109">it solved in five minutes so it's</span> <span data-start="952.109" data-end="953.759">something we just have to kind of keep</span> <span data-start="953.759" data-end="956.099">on top up and say this is this is great</span> <span data-start="956.099" data-end="957.659">we're all about the pursuit of knowledge</span> <span data-start="957.659" data-end="960.389">and and learning about this but at the</span> <span data-start="960.389" data-end="961.829">end of the day we got to ship something</span> <span data-start="961.829" data-end="964.439">so it's just something to be cognizant</span> <span data-start="964.439" data-end="968.249">of we also find developers using doing</span> <span data-start="968.249" data-end="971.669">too much design actually we don't it's</span> <span data-start="971.669" data-end="976.499">it's I didn't have a screenshot of the</span> <span data-start="976.499" data-end="978.749">table thing that you did other day but</span> <span data-start="978.749" data-end="982.289">and this isn't a slight honestly what</span> <span data-start="982.289" data-end="984.599">what is what is awesome and I never get</span> <span data-start="984.599" data-end="987.539">tired of is when when we're talking</span> <span data-start="987.539" data-end="989.189">about features or we talk about planning</span> <span data-start="989.189" data-end="992.759">and the developers are saying hold on a</span> <span data-start="992.759" data-end="995.399">minute we can't do it like this that</span> <span data-start="995.399" data-end="997.049">would be a bad experience that wouldn't</span> <span data-start="997.049" data-end="999.029">look right it wouldn't fit well with the</span> <span data-start="999.029" data-end="1001.369">product and that that happens a lot</span> <span data-start="1001.369" data-end="1005.989">which is really really awesome the</span> <span data-start="1005.989" data-end="1008.299">biggest concern is when is a feature</span> <span data-start="1008.299" data-end="1010.639">done so you're working with design</span> <span data-start="1010.639" data-end="1015.379">development very much entrenched and you</span> <span data-start="1015.379" data-end="1017.329">start getting those problems and you're</span> <span data-start="1017.329" data-end="1019.369">starting to any and you need to solve</span> <span data-start="1019.369" data-end="1022.579">them and that couldn't spiral sometimes</span> <span data-start="1022.579" data-end="1027.679">out of control but at the same time it's</span> <span data-start="1027.679" data-end="1029.87">kind of a good thing so I mean we call</span> <span data-start="1029.87" data-end="1032.269">the scope creep right but the scope is</span> <span data-start="1032.269" data-end="1035.99">rarely right so when it one's a better</span> <span data-start="1035.99" data-end="1037.579">time to do it well right in the middle</span> <span data-start="1037.579" data-end="1039.409">of it when you're when you're building</span> <span data-start="1039.409" data-end="1044.299">the product so it is good but of course</span> <span data-start="1044.299" data-end="1045.829">at the end of the day you need to you</span> <span data-start="1045.829" data-end="1048.559">need to ship something so we still need</span> <span data-start="1048.559" data-end="1050.24">we still struggle with it and we just</span> <span data-start="1050.24" data-end="1052.49">need to plan a bit better at ahead to</span> <span data-start="1052.49" data-end="1053.779">know you know what this looks like one</span> <span data-start="1053.779" data-end="1055.7">of those features that just it's going</span> <span data-start="1055.7" data-end="1059.059">to grow will will often ship things into</span> <span data-start="1059.059" data-end="1060.83">production behind a feature flag will</span> <span data-start="1060.83" data-end="1063.31">play around with it for a while</span> <span data-start="1063.31"
