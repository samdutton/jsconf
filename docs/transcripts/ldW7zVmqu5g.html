<p><span data-start="7.139" data-end="9.55">I'm gonna talk today about style guide</span> <span data-start="9.55" data-end="11.59">driven development on a project that</span> <span data-start="11.59" data-end="14.74">I've been working on at pivotal labs how</span> <span data-start="14.74" data-end="15.97">many people here have done test-driven</span> <span data-start="15.97" data-end="19.06">development Oh awesome so a whole bunch</span> <span data-start="19.06" data-end="21.579">of you do you mind if you haven't done</span> <span data-start="21.579" data-end="22.81">test-driven development raising your</span> <span data-start="22.81" data-end="27.759">hand I see a few ok so basically and</span> <span data-start="27.759" data-end="28.989">this is gonna be my summary of</span> <span data-start="28.989" data-end="31.119">test-driven development because from</span> <span data-start="31.119" data-end="32.71">what I've seen so far everybody that</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="32.71" data-end="34.059">I've ever asked about it comes up with a</span> <span data-start="34.059" data-end="35.53">different answer for exactly what it</span> <span data-start="35.53" data-end="37.87">means but the rough idea is how do you</span> <span data-start="37.87" data-end="40.359">work incrementally and write tests that</span> <span data-start="40.359" data-end="42.25">are going to figure out whether you're</span> <span data-start="42.25" data-end="44.019">on the path to getting your code to do</span> <span data-start="44.019" data-end="46.12">what you want it to do or not and then</span> <span data-start="46.12" data-end="49.199">how do you then later use those tests to</span> <span data-start="49.199" data-end="51.489">to make sure that your code still works</span> <span data-start="51.489" data-end="53.649">when you make other changes and that</span> <span data-start="53.649" data-end="55.3">sounds fantastic but sometimes it kind</span> <span data-start="55.3" data-end="56.92">of works with CSS and other times it</span> <span data-start="56.92" data-end="59.05">doesn't really and so in my project we</span> <span data-start="59.05" data-end="60.249">came up with something called style</span> <span data-start="60.249" data-end="62.079">guide style guide driven development</span> <span data-start="62.079" data-end="64.48">which I think the pivotal labs New York</span> <span data-start="64.48" data-end="66.76">office actually sort of started using</span> <span data-start="66.76" data-end="68.53">that term first and I'm not even really</span> <span data-start="68.53" data-end="70.39">sure where they got it but it's been</span> <span data-start="70.39" data-end="71.77">working out pretty well so I want to</span> <span data-start="71.77" data-end="73.8">tell you a little bit about it I'm</span> <span data-start="73.8" data-end="75.94">sewing to talk about a few things first</span> <span data-start="75.94" data-end="79.87">the goals the challenges our plan how we</span> <span data-start="79.87" data-end="82.33">execute it on it and the results that we</span> <span data-start="82.33" data-end="84.16">got and it gets super important to focus</span> <span data-start="84.16" data-end="86.05">on results because it's something that's</span> <span data-start="86.05" data-end="88.06">really the right approach then it has</span> <span data-start="88.06" data-end="91.51">good results so our goal was to reskin</span> <span data-start="91.51" data-end="94.42">the site to match some new branding we</span> <span data-start="94.42" data-end="97.3">had this site which was you know very</span> <span data-start="97.3" data-end="101.23">heavy and was loading super slow and</span> <span data-start="101.23" data-end="103.03">generally weren't happy with it there</span> <span data-start="103.03" data-end="104.35">were a bunch of things that that just</span> <span data-start="104.35" data-end="105.94">weren't right and the designers really</span> <span data-start="105.94" data-end="109.06">wanted to change it too these were the</span> <span data-start="109.06" data-end="110.77">sort of intermediate designs we came up</span> <span data-start="110.77" data-end="112.72">with we had a two-phase project the</span> <span data-start="112.72" data-end="115.06">first one we called we called B flat</span> <span data-start="115.06" data-end="116.41">because we knew that we weren't going to</span> <span data-start="116.41" data-end="119.74">get to do a huge change in the way any</span> <span data-start="119.74" data-end="121.32">of the UX worked we just needed to</span> <span data-start="121.32" data-end="123.69">flatten things out and get some of the</span> <span data-start="123.69" data-end="127.15">excess UI stuff out of there and then</span> <span data-start="127.15" data-end="129.16">very shortly after we did another</span> <span data-start="129.16" data-end="131.05">redesign which this is what we ended up</span> <span data-start="131.05" data-end="132.06">with</span> <span data-start="132.06" data-end="135.15">basically we didn't know for sure that</span> <span data-start="135.15" data-end="136.68">this would be such a different design</span> <span data-start="136.68" data-end="139.17">when we were going through it but even</span> <span data-start="139.17" data-end="140.79">still the component system that we built</span> <span data-start="140.79" data-end="142.92">and the style guide really helped us get</span> <span data-start="142.92" data-end="145.349">through two major redesigns in something</span> <span data-start="145.349" data-end="149.43">like three or four months so the</span> <span data-start="149.43" data-end="151.44">challenges there were a lot of them</span> <span data-start="151.44" data-end="155.67">actually first there was so much CSS 91%</span> <span data-start="155.67" data-end="158.069">of it unused but on a standard page it</span> <span data-start="158.069" data-end="163.2">was like 314 KB uncompressed it was not</span> <span data-start="163.2" data-end="165.03">so much slowing the page down I mean</span> <span data-start="165.03" data-end="166.379">that was part of it but it was just</span> <span data-start="166.379" data-end="169.019">really unwieldy to work with we had</span> <span data-start="169.019" data-end="171.569">custom CSS per view it's a rails app and</span> <span data-start="171.569" data-end="173.64">rails really wants to encourage you to</span> <span data-start="173.64" data-end="177">write CSS a separate CSS file for every</span> <span data-start="177" data-end="178.53">single view that you have in your app</span> <span data-start="178.53" data-end="179.819">and you kind of have to fight it to get</span> <span data-start="179.819" data-end="182.519">it not to not to have you do that source</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="182.519" data-end="185.129">CSS tended to be either deeply nested</span> <span data-start="185.129" data-end="188.4">and specific and so not reusable at all</span> <span data-start="188.4" data-end="191.579">or it was extremely global almost</span> <span data-start="191.579" data-end="193.17">impossible to know the scope and where</span> <span data-start="193.17" data-end="195">it was used and what in fact you'd break</span> <span data-start="195" data-end="198.69">if you changed any of it we also had a</span> <span data-start="198.69" data-end="200.19">problem with layout proliferation</span> <span data-start="200.19" data-end="201.66">layouts and rails are your sort of</span> <span data-start="201.66" data-end="203.519">top-level templates that your starting</span> <span data-start="203.519" data-end="205.56">points for your app it seemed like for</span> <span data-start="205.56" data-end="207.12">basically every single page we had</span> <span data-start="207.12" data-end="208.65">created a new a new starting point</span> <span data-start="208.65" data-end="211.23">layout even though they weren't actually</span> <span data-start="211.23" data-end="212.489">substantially different</span> <span data-start="212.489" data-end="214.169">what tended to be different in them was</span> <span data-start="214.169" data-end="217.349">actually the content area and when we</span> <span data-start="217.349" data-end="218.669">would make changes we've quite</span> <span data-start="218.669" data-end="220.799">frequently forget that we had another</span> <span data-start="220.799" data-end="223.349">layout for you know some random page and</span> <span data-start="223.349" data-end="225.629">end up with end up with one of our</span> <span data-start="225.629" data-end="227.4">layouts being broken because it wasn't</span> <span data-start="227.4" data-end="231.18">up to date we also kind of had partials</span> <span data-start="231.18" data-end="235.139">inception someone on the team before we</span> <span data-start="235.139" data-end="236.849">all started must have really loved</span> <span data-start="236.849" data-end="238.769">creating partials we had partials for</span> <span data-start="238.769" data-end="241.199">things that weren't shared anywhere we</span> <span data-start="241.199" data-end="243.959">had we had like nested layers like each</span> <span data-start="243.959" data-end="246.12">partial would have like a line or two in</span> <span data-start="246.12" data-end="247.169">it and then it would point to another</span> <span data-start="247.169" data-end="248.879">partial a line or two and it would point</span> <span data-start="248.879" data-end="251.099">to another partial you get like 12 deep</span> <span data-start="251.099" data-end="253.079">before you could finally see anything</span> <span data-start="253.079" data-end="255.919">about what was going on in your partial</span> <span data-start="255.919" data-end="259.62">we also had a sort of more buttons more</span> <span data-start="259.62" data-end="262.109">better philosophy we had like 20 or 30</span> <span data-start="262.109" data-end="263.729">different kinds of buttons different</span> <span data-start="263.729" data-end="264.76">sizes you couldn't</span> <span data-start="264.76" data-end="265.99">and always see that they were different</span> <span data-start="265.99" data-end="267.7">they look like the same orange button</span> <span data-start="267.7" data-end="271.21">but actually they were you know pixel</span> <span data-start="271.21" data-end="272.95">difference or they looked exactly the</span> <span data-start="272.95" data-end="274.51">same but they were actually coded twice</span> <span data-start="274.51" data-end="276.76">and so you'd end up with extra images</span> <span data-start="276.76" data-end="278.59">because of course everything was done</span> <span data-start="278.59" data-end="281.83">with images it didn't have any css3 so</span> <span data-start="281.83" data-end="284.08">it's really hard to change designers</span> <span data-start="284.08" data-end="286.03">would ask for what should be a simple</span> <span data-start="286.03" data-end="288.55">thing like I'd like to update the button</span> <span data-start="288.55" data-end="290.35">styles for the small green buttons and</span> <span data-start="290.35" data-end="291.82">we would give them estimates like well</span> <span data-start="291.82" data-end="293.32">that'll probably take a week which is</span> <span data-start="293.32" data-end="294.94">just not the amount of time it should</span> <span data-start="294.94" data-end="298.9">take to change a button style over we</span> <span data-start="298.9" data-end="301.74">also had jQuery soup and a lot of it</span> <span data-start="301.74" data-end="304.99">everything was these custom widgets and</span> <span data-start="304.99" data-end="307.24">one-offs setup on the page rather than</span> <span data-start="307.24" data-end="309.97">reusable we had like six different ways</span> <span data-start="309.97" data-end="312.97">of toggling something which just seemed</span> <span data-start="312.97" data-end="316.39">a little bit crazy we've also put our</span> <span data-start="316.39" data-end="318.43">frameworks in our assets file which in</span> <span data-start="318.43" data-end="319.93">rails that's where your own code is</span> <span data-start="319.93" data-end="321.94">supposed to go which meant that people</span> <span data-start="321.94" data-end="323.35">felt like it was ok to change them</span> <span data-start="323.35" data-end="325.39">because the Heron assets and so we end</span> <span data-start="325.39" data-end="327.01">up with like all these different</span> <span data-start="327.01" data-end="329.59">frameworks all in assets and slightly</span> <span data-start="329.59" data-end="331.21">modified from their originals so</span> <span data-start="331.21" data-end="335.59">basically impossible to upgrade we also</span> <span data-start="335.59" data-end="338.17">had a sort of epic stories that were</span> <span data-start="338.17" data-end="340.24">sort of difficult to estimate they give</span> <span data-start="340.24" data-end="341.8">us a story that was along the lines of</span> <span data-start="341.8" data-end="344.05">redesigned the marketplace page and</span> <span data-start="344.05" data-end="346.21">we're like yeah that could be you know</span> <span data-start="346.21" data-end="348.04">that could be a few days or that could</span> <span data-start="348.04" data-end="349.75">be a few weeks it's super hard to tell</span> <span data-start="349.75" data-end="352.9">how long that's going to take we also</span> <span data-start="352.9" data-end="354.76">had a crazy deadline constraint we had</span> <span data-start="354.76" data-end="357.07">about six weeks and the design wasn't</span> <span data-start="357.07" data-end="359.35">complete when we got started basically</span> <span data-start="359.35" data-end="361">our PM was supportive but at the same</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="362.41">time he knew that we had to get the</span> <span data-start="362.41" data-end="364.57">first version of the site out and he</span> <span data-start="364.57" data-end="366.64">basically said I need to see some</span> <span data-start="366.64" data-end="369.04">progress by January first and if I don't</span> <span data-start="369.04" data-end="372.25">then I'm gonna have to call the project</span> <span data-start="372.25" data-end="374.74">off and we're gonna just have to you</span> <span data-start="374.74" data-end="376.51">know reskin it whatever we have to do</span> <span data-start="376.51" data-end="378.76">whatever crazy terrible CSS we have to</span> <span data-start="378.76" data-end="380.98">write and I was like no no please give</span> <span data-start="380.98" data-end="383.35">me time we're gonna do it definitely</span> <span data-start="383.35" data-end="385.12">didn't want to write more crazy on top</span> <span data-start="385.12" data-end="388.96">of the crazy that we already had it was</span> <span data-start="388.96" data-end="390.58">a little overwhelming the constraints</span> <span data-start="390.58" data-end="393.19">were pretty tough so we started thinking</span> <span data-start="393.19" data-end="395.38">about how to get there we know what we</span> <span data-start="395.38" data-end="397.58">wanted to look like</span> <span data-start="397.58" data-end="399.439">what we have was too fragile and brittle</span> <span data-start="399.439" data-end="402.37">to really get it there incrementally so</span> <span data-start="402.37" data-end="404.569">what did we want to do we basically</span> <span data-start="404.569" data-end="406.099">decided that we needed to build</span> <span data-start="406.099" data-end="408.949">components and start using style guide</span> <span data-start="408.949" data-end="411.379">driven development to sort of rescue our</span> <span data-start="411.379" data-end="413.449">project from the the chaos that had gone</span> <span data-start="413.449" data-end="415.52">into I should mention as well our</span> <span data-start="415.52" data-end="417.8">velocity was really low we were having</span> <span data-start="417.8" data-end="419.3">trouble releasing features which is</span> <span data-start="419.3" data-end="420.889">something that happens to teams when</span> <span data-start="420.889" data-end="421.909">they get into a place where their</span> <span data-start="421.909" data-end="424.189">front-end code is really messy it gets</span> <span data-start="424.189" data-end="425.81">really hard to get something new out</span> <span data-start="425.81" data-end="427.25">because you're having to work around all</span> <span data-start="427.25" data-end="431.75">this legacy to get anything released and</span> <span data-start="431.75" data-end="433.849">some components helped us structure the</span> <span data-start="433.849" data-end="435.65">site and now I'll give you a little demo</span> <span data-start="435.65" data-end="438.259">and this style guide is actually live on</span> <span data-start="438.259" data-end="444.77">the web so you can check it out I will</span> <span data-start="444.77" data-end="446.36">tweet out the link later but it's at</span> <span data-start="446.36" data-end="448.819">console run pivotal do and it's slash</span> <span data-start="448.819" data-end="451.25">style guide and we decided to build on</span> <span data-start="451.25" data-end="453.11">top of bootstrap mainly because the</span> <span data-start="453.11" data-end="456.169">product wasn't defined yet we didn't</span> <span data-start="456.169" data-end="457.639">know exactly what it was going to be or</span> <span data-start="457.639" data-end="459.169">what it was for the designers were still</span> <span data-start="459.169" data-end="460.759">doing a lot of user testing and still</span> <span data-start="460.759" data-end="462.83">figuring out like why would somebody use</span> <span data-start="462.83" data-end="465.889">this it's a tool for the product that I</span> <span data-start="465.889" data-end="468.77">work on is a tool for being able to</span> <span data-start="468.77" data-end="470.539">scale cloud applications adding</span> <span data-start="470.539" data-end="472.669">instances

data-end="497.33">to go to a CLI so our designers we're</span> <span data-start="497.33" data-end="498.71">still doing a lot of research to figure</span> <span data-start="498.71" data-end="503.36">out why would somebody use this over you</span> <span data-start="503.36" data-end="504.979">know over the CLI over the tool that</span> <span data-start="504.979"

data-end="1776.079">fast and that didn't work either</span> <span data-start="1776.079" data-end="1778.269">so iterating with the designer we were</span> <span data-start="1778.269"
