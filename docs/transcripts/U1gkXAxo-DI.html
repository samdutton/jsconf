<p><span data-start="74.4" data-end="82.5">James Caan I put out this site html5</span> <span data-start="82.5" data-end="84.53">readiness and the main idea here is that</span> <span data-start="84.53" data-end="87.21">we're not dealing with waiting for html5</span> <span data-start="87.21" data-end="89.22">to be ready we're waiting for features</span> <span data-start="89.22" data-end="90.84">with inside html5 to be ready all these</span> <span data-start="90.84" data-end="93.119">features are implemented incrementally</span> <span data-start="93.119" data-end="96.329">across browsers so think of it that way</span> <span data-start="96.329" data-end="99.03">instead of you know what are the big</span> <span data-start="99.03" data-end="102.06">things so for instance like at font-face</span> <span data-start="102.06" data-end="107.31">in css3 has had support in ie6 578</span> <span data-start="107.31" data-end="110.82">everything something like drag-and-drop</span> <span

data-end="120.899">that doesn't really have great support</span> <span data-start="120.899" data-end="126.78">yet so yeah but if we take a look at all</span> <span data-start="126.78" data-end="129.929">of all of the html5 features kind of</span> <span data-start="129.929" data-end="133.79">what how can we break these up so I</span> <span data-start="133.79" data-end="135.93">think we can break them up like this so</span> <span data-start="135.93" data-end="138.48">here we have dependable features and</span> <span data-start="138.48" data-end="139.53">these are the things that

<span data-start="1403.23" data-end="1404.25">you probably do a feature detection</span> <span data-start="1404.25" data-end="1405.69">right probably something like modern</span> <span data-start="1405.69" data-end="1409.44">eyes right here it's awesome but you</span> <span data-start="1409.44" data-end="1411.87">want to support the older browsers and</span> <span data-start="1411.87" data-end="1413.1">you want to give them some of these</span> <span data-start="1413.1" data-end="1414.84">features and functionalities so you want</span> <span data-start="1414.84" data-end="1416.85">to employ something like you might call</span> <span data-start="1416.85" data-end="1419.01">it regressive enhancement because we're</span> <span data-start="1419.01" data-end="1420.45">going to give these features back to the</span> <span data-start="1420.45" data-end="1423.84">old browsers in a mostly consistent</span> <span data-start="1423.84" data-end="1426.18">fashion and this is not really like</span> <span data-start="1426.18" data-end="1428.04">doing it twice it's like doing it 1.1</span> <span data-start="1428.04" data-end="1431.01">times and most of the work has already</span> <span data-start="1431.01" data-end="1433.59">been done for you so what I did is I</span> <span data-start="1433.59" data-end="1434.7">pulled together all the different</span> <span data-start="1434.7" data-end="1436.35">scripts that people have done to kind of</span> <span data-start="1436.35" data-end="1440.76">do this thing and so we have a big happy</span> <span data-start="1440.76" data-end="1443.25">list of all the we're gonna calm</span> <span data-start="1443.25" data-end="1445.53">polyfills I think Remy sharp came up</span> <span data-start="1445.53" data-end="1446.6">with this I think it's a good term</span> <span data-start="1446.6" data-end="1449.04">polyfills to basically provide the</span> <span data-start="1449.04" data-end="1450.78">support the fall back to shim whatever</span> <span data-start="1450.78" data-end="1456.33">so we have the SVG web ex canvas shims</span> <span data-start="1456.33" data-end="1458.37">using either window dot name or cookies</span> <span data-start="1458.37" data-end="1460.38">or whatever to imitate session storage</span> <span

data-end="1468.12">actually has the API of the html5 media</span> <span data-start="1468.12" data-end="1471.15">elements and you kind of use it like you</span> <span data-start="1471.15" data-end="1474.69">would want to mimicking all the the</span> <span data-start="1474.69" data-end="1476.43">input type date picker color picker</span> <span data-start="1476.43" data-end="1479.66">stuff so you're you're writing code</span> <span data-start="1479.66" data-end="1483.06">writing html5 code that is going to use</span> <span data-start="1483.06" data-end="1484.29">the native things when it's there and</span> <span data-start="1484.29" data-end="1487.11">then going to mimic that exact same</span> <span data-start="1487.11" data-end="1490.68">behavior in older browsers so there's a</span> <span data-start="1490.68" data-end="1492.15">lot of good stuff in here and I've also</span> <span data-start="1492.15" data-end="1493.53">added a lot of things where we don't</span> <span data-start="1493.53" data-end="1495.99">really have support for the progress and</span> <span data-start="1495.99" data-end="1498.24">meter elements no one's really made a</span> <span data-start="1498.24" data-end="1500.91">script that kind of give support to</span> <span data-start="1500.91" data-end="1503.91">older browsers for those but I'd love to</span> <span data-start="1503.91" data-end="1507.63">get your help and kind of filling in</span> <span data-start="1507.63" data-end="1511.8">these holes and you know one of the</span> <span data-start="1511.8" data-end="1513.18">challenges we want to provide these</span> <span data-start="1513.18" data-end="1514.71">scripts to older browsers and then it's</span> <span data-start="1514.71" data-end="1517.44">like a lot of these little scripts so we</span> <span data-start="1517.44" data-end="1519.54">have none a new thing from the author of</span> <span data-start="1519.54" data-end="1520.79">go to GIS</span> <span data-start="1520.79" data-end="1522.89">and co-author of a purge is Alex Sexton</span> <span data-start="1522.89" data-end="1527.26">we have yep nope yep nope is a</span> <span data-start="1527.26" data-end="1530.77">conditional script loader and so it uses</span> <span data-start="1530.77" data-end="1533.87">lab jass under the hood and so</span> <span data-start="1533.87" data-end="1536.15">essentially this is it so we're going to</span> <span data-start="1536.15" data-end="1539.12">just do a test so modernizer indexdb</span> <span data-start="1539.12" data-end="1541.19">this is going to return either true or</span> <span data-start="1541.19" data-end="1544.28">false yep if it does return true we're</span> <span data-start="1544.28" data-end="1547.58">going to include these files otherwise</span> <span data-start="1547.58" data-end="1550.85">we're going to chuck in these and we so</span> <span data-start="1550.85" data-end="1552.29">we can get the benefits of a dynamic</span> <span data-start="1552.29" data-end="1555.86">strip loader added with conditional in</span> <span data-start="1555.86" data-end="1557.81">this so we can do our future detect it's</span> <span data-start="1557.81" data-end="1564.08">on that and if that sounds like too much</span> <span data-start="1564.08" data-end="1566.9">work you could make money chrome web</span> <span data-start="1566.9" data-end="1570.62">store I hear it's pretty awesome so</span> <span data-start="1570.62" data-end="1572.62">basically you know you build a web app</span> <span data-start="1572.62" data-end="1574.46">you can throw it in the Chrome Web Store</span> <span data-start="1574.46" data-end="1575.84">you're going to have much higher</span> <span data-start="1575.84" data-end="1578.3">discoverability and you can make money</span> <span data-start="1578.3" data-end="1582.02">on it which is a novel idea you can also</span> <span data-start="1582.02"

to choose adding this shim to add</span> <span data-start="1630.95" data-end="1632.69">consistency is just not worth the</span> <span data-start="1632.69" data-end="1634.07">performance hit and so
