data-start="1065.539" data-end="1066.679">we're actually starting up an</span> <span data-start="1066.679" data-end="1067.669">application and creating a new</span> <span data-start="1067.669" data-end="1069.32">application and we're telling the</span> <span data-start="1069.32" data-end="1071.24">application what the views are so in</span> <span data-start="1071.24" data-end="1072.77">this case we're just mapping a view ID</span> <span data-start="1072.77" data-end="1075.62">to a specific view class so classes are</span> <span data-start="1075.62" data-end="1077">something that's reusable so maybe I had</span> <span data-start="1077" data-end="1078.59">three different ticker screens and they</span> <span data-start="1078.59" data-end="1080.27">all had different content I could</span> <span data-start="1080.27" data-end="1081.559">actually go in and specify three</span> <span data-start="1081.559" data-end="1083.029">different IDs and all have them from the</span> <span data-start="1083.029" data-end="1084.529">same view class and then they could</span> <span data-start="1084.529" data-end="1086.419">actually internally switch based off of</span> <span

<p><span data-start="1093.62" data-end="1095.659">ID for the default view in this case</span> <span data-start="1095.659" data-end="1098.419">it's the view main so this way whenever</span> <span data-start="1098.419" data-end="1100.37">if you hit on the top title bar or if</span> <span data-start="1100.37" data-end="1103.159">you are navigating inside the widget and</span> <span

data-start="1117.47" data-end="1117.95">says something</span> <span data-start="1117.95" data-end="1119.389">mation about the widget but if you had</span> <span data-start="1119.389" data-end="1121.519">more detailed settings there's actually</span> <span data-start="1121.519" data-end="1122.84">a green button that you can press on</span> <span data-start="1122.84" data-end="1124.039">your remote control to get into the</span> <span data-start="1124.039" data-end="1125.84">settings we have to obviously know then</span> <span data-start="1125.84"

data-end="1131.419">automatically send them there so let's</span> <span data-start="1131.419" data-end="1133.039">actually go in and kind of dissect one</span> <span data-start="1133.039" data-end="1134.45">of these views so we'll look at the most</span> <span data-start="1134.45" data-end="1137.269">basic one first this first one here is</span> <span data-start="1137.269" data-end="1139.159">going to be the snippet view the snippet</span> <span data-start="1139.159" data-end="1141.71">view as you can see we're just going in</span> <span data-start="1141.71" data-end="1144.399">and we are creating a new context class</span> <span data-start="1144.399" data-end="1146.63">as I said those of you who have used</span> <span data-start="1146.63" data-end="1148.58">mootools you'll see that there's a bit</span> <span data-start="1148.58" data-end="1150.86">of similarity here we're actually using</span> <span data-start="1150.86" data-end="1152.899">kind of a pseudo classical inheritance</span> <span data-start="1152.899" data-end="1154.76">inside the framework so we're extending</span> <span data-start="1154.76" data-end="1157.309">from context context system anchor</span> <span data-start="1157.309" data-end="1159.139">snippet view so an anchor snippet view</span> <span data-start="1159.139" data-end="1160.88">is something that's always in the dock</span> <span data-start="1160.88" data-end="1163.07">and you know widget can actually have</span> <span data-start="1163.07" data-end="1164.179">multiple snippets that the user can</span> <span data-start="1164.179" data-end="1166.01">scroll through whenever they're on your</span> <span data-start="1166.01" data-end="1168.919">position in the dock so additional ones</span> <span data-start="1168.919" data-end="1170.059">that you could have like there may be</span> <span data-start="1170.059" data-end="1171.799">added real time would be like a profile</span> <span data-start="1171.799" data-end="1174.169">snippet view so for example say I was in</span> <span data-start="1174.169" data-end="1175.88">the news widget if I wanted to be able</span> <span data-start="1175.88" data-end="1177.679">to bookmark a specific category so I can</span> <span data-start="1177.679" data-end="1179.63">get in faster to that category I could</span> <span data-start="1179.63" data-end="1180.519">hit a button on my remote control</span> <span data-start="1180.519" data-end="1182.63">bookmark that and then that would be a</span> <span data-start="1182.63" data-end="1183.95">profile snippet view because it's tied</span> <span data-start="1183.95" data-end="1187.22">to my specific user on the TV now each</span> <span data-start="1187.22" data-end="1189.26">one of the views and the view life cycle</span> <span data-start="1189.26" data-end="1191.539">there is a knit view there's a create</span> <span data-start="1191.539" data-end="1193.82">view and an update view a knit view is</span> <span data-start="1193.82" data-end="1195.649">kind of like an initialized method it's</span> <span data-start="1195.649" data-end="1197.149">anything that you need to do when your</span> <span data-start="1197.149" data-end="1198.919">class is first substantial for the first</span> <span data-start="1198.919" data-end="1200.809">time you would put that inside the net</span> <span data-start="1200.809" data-end="1203.539">view create view is the method that's</span> <span data-start="1203.539" data-end="1206.48">called whenever you when your your view</span> <span data-start="1206.48" data-end="1207.71">is actually first shown for the first</span> <span data-start="1207.71" data-end="1210.049">time so this is where you actually go in</span> <span data-start="1210.049" data-end="1212.09">and render all the basically the Dom</span> <span data-start="1212.09" data-end="1213.529">nodes that would be going into the DOM</span> <span data-start="1213.529" data-end="1215.45">and in this case for the snippet view is</span> <span data-start="1215.45" data-end="1217.22">simply just a single image that's being</span> <span data-start="1217.22" data-end="1219.409">put into the DOM and then update view is</span> <span data-start="1219.409" data-end="1221">actually called every single time your</span> <span data-start="1221" data-end="1222.679">view is updated so if I go to the main</span> <span data-start="1222.679" data-end="1224.69">view then go to the OAuth view and then</span> <span data-start="1224.69" data-end="1226.789">come back to the main view my update</span> <span data-start="1226.789" data-end="1228.2">view call would get called the first</span> <span data-start="1228.2" data-end="1229.94">time whenever I first load it in and</span> <span data-start="1229.94" data-end="1231.559">then the second time after I came back</span> <span data-start="1231.559" data-end="1233.299">from the OAuth view and I'll show you</span> <span data-start="1233.299" data-end="1236.659">some more of that in a bit again there's</span> <span data-start="1236.659" data-end="1238.22">actually standardized controls for</span> <span data-start="1238.22" data-end="1239.45">putting in most of the elements on the</span> <span data-start="1239.45" data-end="1241.25">screen so in this case here where it is</span> <span data-start="1241.25" data-end="1242.929">creating a new image and we're giving it</span> <span data-start="1242.929" data-end="1245.149">a source setting some be offset and H</span> <span data-start="1245.149" data-end="1247.01">offsets and then appending it into the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1247.01" data-end="1250.97">Dom for the window</span> <span data-start="1250.98" data-end="1253.62">the main view has a little bit more meat</span> <span data-start="1253.62" data-end="1257.25">to it first of all there is a several</span> <span data-start="1257.25" data-end="1259.32">images that make up this view so when</span> <span data-start="1259.32" data-end="1260.88">we're actually in there I'll go back and</span> <span data-start="1260.88" data-end="1263.37">show you there's a image for the logo</span> <span data-start="1263.37" data-end="1265.29">that goes across the top there's another</span> <span data-start="1265.29" data-end="1267.03">image for the fade that kind of does a</span> <span data-start="1267.03" data-end="1269.58">menu on the background there's also a</span> <span data-start="1269.58" data-end="1273.96">reflection which is the is actually the</span> <span data-start="1273.96" data-end="1275.37">reflection of the image that's shown up</span> <span data-start="1275.37" data-end="1276.84">on the screen there and then what we're</span> <span data-start="1276.84" data-end="1278.13">doing is we're setting kind of an</span> <span data-start="1278.13" data-end="1279.72">opacity a point for so that way it's a</span> <span data-start="1279.72" data-end="1282.419">little bit dim down and unfortunately</span> <span data-start="1282.419" data-end="1283.53">reflection is something that is</span> <span data-start="1283.53" data-end="1285.09">entrapped into the framework as easy</span> <span data-start="1285.09" data-end="1287.46">helper method so this is the two lines</span> <span data-start="1287.46" data-end="1288.99">of code that you would do to actually</span> <span data-start="1288.99" data-end="1290.76">reflect that image and flip it upside</span> <span data-start="1290.76" data-end="1291.84">down so that way it gives kind of a</span> <span data-start="1291.84" data-end="1295.47">reflection effect to it then basically</span> <span data-start="1295.47" data-end="1297.24">we have a text element that goes in and</span> <span data-start="1297.24" data-end="1298.74">puts some text on the screen in this</span> <span data-start="1298.74" data-end="1300.03">case get the most from your professional</span> <span data-start="1300.03" data-end="1302.549">network we put a little of a shadow set</span> <span data-start="1302.549" data-end="1304.65">the font sizes colors pretty standard</span> <span data-start="1304.65" data-end="1307.82">stuff there for similar to CSS for that</span> <span data-start="1307.82" data-end="1310.59">then we create two buttons in this case</span> <span data-start="1310.59" data-end="1311.7">here we're actually creating text</span> <span data-start="1311.7" data-end="1312.9">buttons which is just a button that has</span> <span data-start="1312.9" data-end="1315.9">a text label on it we're giving a class</span> <span data-start="1315.9"

data-end="1320.28">that you would normally see in a menu</span> <span data-start="1320.28" data-end="1322.679">section and we set some labels and then</span> <span data-start="1322.679" data-end="1324.72">we actually set up an events block for</span> <span data-start="1324.72" data-end="1327.69">whenever the events are fired so in this</span> <span data-start="1327.69"

data-end="1362.96">going to load on the view dash ticker</span> <span data-start="1362.96" data-end="1365.58">because it doesn't look good on the</span> <span data-start="1365.58"
