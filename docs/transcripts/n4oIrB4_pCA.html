<p><span data-start="383.02" data-end="385.99">I was listening in this podcast last</span> <span data-start="385.99" data-end="387.58">week and was interviewed with Yura</span> <span

12 minutes in the podcast</span> <span data-start="396.03" data-end="398.86">interviewer made a statement</span> <span data-start="398.86" data-end="402.3">everybody wants distributed tracing I</span> <span data-start="402.3" data-end="404.65">stop right there for a moment and I</span> <span data-start="404.65" data-end="407.349">started to wonder how many of you have</span> <span data-start="407.349" data-end="408.849">heard of distributed tracing before this</span> <span data-start="408.849" data-end="412.21">conference whew that's pretty good</span> <span data-start="412.21" data-end="415.27">but maybe like maybe half not everyone</span> <span data-start="415.27" data-end="417.759">and what I've found in my travels</span> <span data-start="417.759" data-end="419.919">particularly in front-end development is</span> <span data-start="419.919" data-end="422.919">a lot of people haven't heard of it and</span> <span data-start="422.919" data-end="424.15">if you don't work in enterprise software</span> <span data-start="424.15" data-end="426.25">or an organization that maybe already</span> <span data-start="426.25" data-end="428.5">has this on the back end you might not</span> <span data-start="428.5" data-end="431.62">have had exposure or the need to look at</span> <span data-start="431.62" data-end="434.259">this and the other interesting thing</span> <span data-start="434.259" data-end="436.18">about this podcast is this was about 12</span> <span data-start="436.18" data-end="437.71">minutes in they talked about micro</span> <span data-start="437.71" data-end="439.449">servers for the first 12 minutes and</span> <span data-start="439.449" data-end="440.919">that's actually where I think a lot of</span> <span data-start="440.919" data-end="442.569">the content around distributed tracing</span> <span data-start="442.569" data-end="445.06">is focused is on the back end and how we</span> <span data-start="445.06" data-end="447.25">handle the requests to our micro</span> <span data-start="447.25" data-end="449.11">services I want to look at that in a</span> <span data-start="449.11" data-end="451.93">different way today when I look at these</span> <span data-start="451.93" data-end="455.409">front end spans the the blue that you</span> <span data-start="455.409" data-end="457.629">see here at the top where it doesn't has</span> <span data-start="457.629" data-end="459.25">a front end before it these are</span> <span data-start="459.25" data-end="461.469">basically identifying when the request</span> <span data-start="461.469" data-end="463.419">came in from the front end there's no</span> <span data-start="463.419" data-end="465.88">other information about what happened in</span> <span data-start="465.88" data-end="468.55">the browser to kick off that request I</span> <span data-start="468.55" data-end="470.11">want to go a little deeper there if we</span> <span data-start="470.11" data-end="472.99">can so how do we apply this to the front</span> <span data-start="472.99" data-end="476.44">end the first thing to think about is</span> <span data-start="476.44" data-end="478.719">well what makes up a trace when do we</span> <span data-start="478.719" data-end="481.09">have a trace what do we consider a user</span> <span data-start="481.09" data-end="483.88">request so I think about two things</span> <span data-start="483.88" data-end="487.029">really when we're loading a page or</span> <span data-start="487.029" data-end="489.279">doing a route change we're loading a</span> <span data-start="489.279"

data-end="495.969">they're doing an inline edit or they're</span> <span data-start="495.969" data-end="498.46">doing a button click basically any time</span> <span data-start="498.46" data-end="500.319">the user interacts with the application</span> <span data-start="500.319" data-end="502">whether they're pulling it down for the</span> <span data-start="502" data-end="504.4">first time or navigating to another page</span> <span data-start="504.4" data-end="507.52">or clicking on a button that is when we</span> <span data-start="507.52" data-end="509.08">want to start thinking about what's</span> <span data-start="509.08" data-end="513.13">happening and that's a user action the</span> <span data-start="513.13" data-end="514.779">other way the other side to think about</span> <span data-start="514.779" data-end="516.55">is the feedback that we're giving to the</span> <span data-start="516.55" data-end="519.399">user when does the page render when has</span>
