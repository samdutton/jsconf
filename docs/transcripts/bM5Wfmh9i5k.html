data-end="339.92">been a while we should catch up later</span> <span data-start="339.92" data-end="344.84">when you're done running next is linear</span> <span data-start="344.84" data-end="349">if

<p><span data-start="400.4" data-end="402.35">I invite you for a very specific reason</span> <span data-start="402.35" data-end="404.87">and that reason is I hate your guts so</span> <span data-start="404.87" data-end="411.35">bye I'm a very mean party person to give</span> <span data-start="411.35" data-end="413.03">you an idea of how many operations were</span> <span

data-end="420.83">for a given set of items with five items</span> <span data-start="420.83" data-end="424.039">nothing is really that bad small number</span> <span data-start="424.039" data-end="427.46">and we can do lots of operations so but</span> <span data-start="427.46" data-end="430.759">by 10 items you're already got a pretty</span> <span data-start="430.759" data-end="433.1">big difference for polynomial starting</span> <span data-start="433.1" data-end="435.26">the millions of operations but</span> <span data-start="435.26" data-end="438.49">everything else is mostly acceptable</span> <span data-start="438.49" data-end="443.24">next ship 20 and it's getting absurd and</span> <span data-start="443.24" data-end="445.49">then by 30 polynomial is just just</span> <span data-start="445.49" data-end="448.88">ridiculous and you can already see how</span> <span data-start="448.88" data-end="450.41">the other ones of those are already</span> <span data-start="450.41" data-end="452.72">getting to be pretty large numbers for</span> <span data-start="452.72" data-end="458.87">what could be like pretty low numbers so</span> <span data-start="458.87" data-end="461.03">with data structures you have four</span> <span data-start="461.03" data-end="463.46">primary types of actions that you can</span> <span data-start="463.46"

data-end="471.38">structures may be good at one of these</span> <span data-start="471.38" data-end="475.55">things and not at another and so here</span> <span data-start="475.55" data-end="476.96">you can see three common types of</span> <span data-start="476.96" data-end="480.08">ordered data structures arrays linked</span> <span data-start="480.08" data-end="482.69">lists in binary search trees

<span data-start="487.01" data-end="489.919">them with our party descriptions even</span> <span data-start="489.919" data-end="492.05">further some actions will have a</span> <span data-start="492.05"

very differently depending on</span> <span data-start="498.289" data-end="500.84">the type of data set and sometimes</span> <span data-start="500.84" data-end="503.15">random things are thrown in

things</span> <span data-start="539.05" data-end="540.94">in programming languages are zero index</span> <span data-start="540.94" data-end="543.04">sort of works kind of like memory in</span> <span

data-end="1729.049">sound like a lot but it's only ten</span> <span data-start="1729.049" data-end="1733.14">checks to go placed in 1,000 items</span> <span data-start="1733.14" data-end="1738.3">and while it would have been faster if</span> <span data-start="1738.3" data-end="1741.9">we just went 1 2 3 4 5 in general if we</span> <span data-start="1741.9" data-end="1745.8">were going to 999 that would have been</span> <span data-start="1745.8" data-end="1749.55">909 checks down to 10 that's where 0 and</span> <span data-start="1749.55" data-end="1753.42">comes from the other important thing to</span> <span data-start="1753.42" data-end="1755.64">note about binary search trees is that</span> <span data-start="1755.64" data-end="1757.38">they're very similar to linked lists and</span> <span data-start="1757.38" data-end="1759.63">that they in the sense you only need to</span> <span data-start="1759.63" data-end="1761.49">update the immediately surrounding items</span> <span

data-start="1774.87" data-end="1777.6">exists in the tree we're going to need</span> <span data-start="1777.6" data-end="1781.17">to first search through the tree we</span> <span data-start="1781.17" data-end="1783.72">start at the root and then we're going</span> <span data-start="1783.72" data-end="1785.55">to keep running as long as we have</span> <span data-start="1785.55" data-end="1789.63">another node to visit if we reach a left</span> <span data-start="1789.63" data-end="1792.57">or right that is no then this loop ends</span> <span data-start="1792.57" data-end="1793.98">and we assume that we did not have</span> <span data-start="1793.98" data-end="1797.73">anything in the tree if the value is</span> <span data-start="1797.73"

data-end="1817.56">matched anything then we return false</span> <span data-start="1817.56" data-end="1821.07">that's how we implement contains in</span> <span data-start="1821.07" data-end="1822.84">order to add items for the tree we're</span> <span data-start="1822.84" data-end="1824.52">going to do the same sort of traversal</span> <span data-start="1824.52"

data-end="1835.11">left or right that is null we're going</span> <span data-start="1835.11" data-end="1839.61">to add a new node in that position first</span> <span data-start="1839.61"

data-end="1849.08">that we just add one and return</span> <span data-start="1849.08" data-end="1852.51">otherwise we start at the roots and</span> <span data-start="1852.51" data-end="1853.95">we're

not</span> <span data-start="1863.4" data-end="1866.04">exist we set it to our node and stop</span> <span data-start="1866.04" data-end="1867.19">traverse</span> <span data-start="1867.19"

data-end="1879.169">we check if it does not exist we set it</span> <span data-start="1879.169" data-end="1881.019">to our node and stop traversing</span> <span data-start="1881.019" data-end="1883.34">otherwise we just move on to the left</span> <span data-start="1883.34" data-end="1886.519">node if the number isn't less than or</span> <span data-start="1886.519" data-end="1888.679">greater to then it must be the same and</span> <span data-start="1888.679" data-end="1890.269">so we don't do anything we just break</span> <span data-start="1890.269" data-end="1892.249">and stop and the note isn't added</span> <span data-start="1892.249" data-end="1896.029">because it's already exists and that's</span> <span data-start="1896.029"

data-end="1921.95">also wrote a Babel handbook that you can</span> <span data-start="1921.95" data-end="1924.349">also check out anyways now we're</span> <span data-start="1924.349"
