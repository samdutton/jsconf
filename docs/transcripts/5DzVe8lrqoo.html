data-start="858.64" data-end="860.41">so for example if you keep finding</span> <span data-start="860.41" data-end="862.33">yourself doing reply and then for</span> <span data-start="862.33" data-end="864.94">success you always return some JSON</span> <span data-start="864.94" data-end="866.44">structure that says you know success</span> <span data-start="866.44" data-end="870.13">equal true and you know message equal</span> <span data-start="870.13" data-end="871.959">hooray and whatever it is and you keep</span> <span data-start="871.959" data-end="873.839">doing that again again again you can now</span> <span data-start="873.839" data-end="877.12">call server declare and you can</span> <span data-start="877.12" data-end="878.709">basically decorate the reply interface</span> <span data-start="878.709" data-end="881.14">to include the success method so now you</span> <span data-start="881.14" data-end="882.88">can call reply that success and that's</span> <span data-start="882.88" data-end="884.95">it you don't have to constantly repeat</span> <span data-start="884.95" data-end="887.08">that code the same thing with a server</span> <span data-start="887.08" data-end="889.42">you can i decorate server so you can add</span> <span data-start="889.42" data-end="892.27">features so in happy eight if you look</span> <span data-start="892.27" data-end="894.13">at the source code of a p8 there is no</span> <span data-start="894.13" data-end="897.58">replied proxy or reply that file there</span> <span data-start="897.58" data-end="900.73">is no file directory handlers anymore in</span> <span data-start="900.73" data-end="902.62">the source code it's still there but</span> <span data-start="902.62" data-end="904.48">what happy is doing it's not happy is</span> <span data-start="904.48" data-end="906.31">requiring those three modules I</span> <span data-start="906.31" data-end="907.87">mentioned those are now full plugins</span> <span data-start="907.87" data-end="910.51">they're just plain plugins happy</span> <span data-start="910.51" data-end="912.69">requiring them automatically for you and</span> <span data-start="912.69" data-end="915.88">that and those plugins decorate happy</span> <span data-start="915.88" data-end="918.19">without extra functionality what's cool</span> <span data-start="918.19" data-end="919.899">about besides me you know not having to</span> <span data-start="919.899" data-end="922.06">do it anymore is the fact that now you</span> <span data-start="922.06" data-end="925.75">are an equal footing with what I was</span> <span data-start="925.75" data-end="927.97">able to do before internally you cannot</span> <span data-start="927.97" data-end="930.279">do anything you want outside so all the</span> <span data-start="930.279" data-end="933.66">power that we before was you know under</span> <span data-start="933.66" data-end="935.91">score internal variable internal</span> <span data-start="935.91" data-end="938.1">facilities that you know it sound like</span> <span data-start="938.1" data-end="940.26">you know I I use them in other modules</span> <span data-start="940.26" data-end="942.66">because it were all mine there's none of</span> <span data-start="942.66" data-end="944.49">that anymore so those plugins are now</span> <span data-start="944.49" data-end="949.85">built completely on on public API and</span> <span data-start="949.85" data-end="954.57">and there's a new feature that I'm going</span> <span data-start="954.57" data-end="956.39">to use all the time a lot of people but</span> <span data-start="956.39" data-end="958.8">you cannot create a server with a</span> <span data-start="958.8" data-end="961.29">minimal flag and it will not load those</span> <span data-start="961.29" data-end="963.27">plugins by default so you can actually</span> <span data-start="963.27" data-end="966.21">create a server that has nothing it</span> <span data-start="966.21" data-end="968.25">doesn't have files or directories or or</span> <span data-start="968.25" data-end="970.83">views or any of that stuff you can</span> <span data-start="970.83" data-end="972.69">create a completely bare bone happy</span> <span data-start="972.69" data-end="975">server and that means you can now create</span> <span data-start="975" data-end="978.03">your own Fork of the file system plug-in</span> <span data-start="978.03" data-end="980.64">and and change the native functionality</span> <span data-start="980.64" data-end="985.38">the way you want to be a more advanced</span> <span data-start="985.38" data-end="988.23">concept is called realm realm is new and</span> <span data-start="988.23" data-end="989.88">happy eight I think it's the only really</span> <span data-start="989.88" data-end="994.44">new concept in the release and and what</span> <span data-start="994.44" data-end="997.59">realms are it's really like this is a</span> <span data-start="997.59" data-end="999.24">very primitive version of what I my</span> <span data-start="999.24" data-end="1002.03">vision is in future versions but what</span> <span data-start="1002.03" data-end="1004.73">realms are is is a way to send box</span> <span data-start="1004.73" data-end="1007.36">plugins to their own ecosystem</span> <span data-start="1007.36" data-end="1010.72">completely so you'll be able to define a</span> <span data-start="1010.72" data-end="1013.94">final state a cookie in a plug-in does</span> <span data-start="1013.94" data-end="1015.98">not leak outside the plug-in it will</span> <span data-start="1015.98" data-end="1018.44">have zero impact on any other plugins</span> <span data-start="1018.44" data-end="1020.51">you might have so you can have a plug-in</span> <span data-start="1020.51" data-end="1022.4">that adds a bunch of routes define some</span> <span data-start="1022.4" data-end="1025.43">cookies add extensions and now that will</span> <span data-start="1025.43" data-end="1028.34">apply to any other plug-in so you can</span> <span data-start="1028.34" data-end="1030.86">have two plugins that have the same cook</span> <span data-start="1030.86" data-end="1033.86">you define what are the same in the same</span> <span data-start="1033.86" data-end="1035.48">name because that that's because HTTP</span> <span data-start="1035.48" data-end="1037.7">still going to send the same one but but</span> <span data-start="1037.7" data-end="1039.59">you'll be able to define things that</span> <span data-start="1039.59" data-end="1042.71">will not leak or overlap between between</span> <span data-start="1042.71" data-end="1044.72">different plugins and with the</span> <span data-start="1044.72" data-end="1046.37">extensions really important because our</span> <span data-start="1046.37" data-end="1049.1">people have been adding extensions to</span> <span data-start="1049.1" data-end="1051.05">their plug-in functionality and the</span> <span data-start="1051.05" data-end="1052.31">problem is it's very inefficient because</span> <span data-start="1052.31" data-end="1054.08">now those extensions are running on</span> <span data-start="1054.08" data-end="1055.97">every other route in the Indy in the</span> <span data-start="1055.97" data-end="1058.64">server and so to avoid that you're going</span> <span data-start="1058.64" data-end="1061.16">to get a config that says only if I mark</span> <span data-start="1061.16" data-end="1063.56">this as my route in some settings then</span> <span data-start="1063.56" data-end="1065.3">run this extension on so you basically</span> <span data-start="1065.3" data-end="1066.58">with every other</span> <span data-start="1066.58" data-end="1068.289">you come in and you say hey is this red</span> <span data-start="1068.289" data-end="1070">part of my plug-in or it's not I'm not</span> <span data-start="1070" data-end="1072.519">going to run this extension on it's just</span> <span data-start="1072.519" data-end="1074.169">more function calls and some calls are</span> <span data-start="1074.169" data-end="1077.409">expensive in JavaScript so we're trying</span> <span data-start="1077.409" data-end="1080.14">to avoid that so that's the future what</span> <span data-start="1080.14" data-end="1084.539">room is right now is just a way to do a</span> <span data-start="1084.539" data-end="1088.45">two layer configuration so when you do</span> <span data-start="1088.45" data-end="1090.13">server when you have the server object</span> <span data-start="1090.13" data-end="1092.08">server has a realm and it's a container</span> <span data-start="1092.08" data-end="1093.34">that has a few properties you can look a</span> <span data-start="1093.34" data-end="1094.51">documentation see what's in there is</span> <span data-start="1094.51" data-end="1096.399">some settings in there and then the plug</span> <span data-start="1096.399" data-end="1097.99">area for plugins to put whatever they</span> <span data-start="1097.99" data-end="1102.37">want in there when you call register the</span> <span data-start="1102.37" data-end="1104.44">server that the register function gets</span> <span data-start="1104.44" data-end="1107.679">has its own realm that's different from</span> <span data-start="1107.679" data-end="1110.71">the root server on that server there's</span> <span data-start="1110.71" data-end="1112.63">also served that route which is the root</span> <span data-start="1112.63" data-end="1115.389">server that realm so in any place you</span> <span data-start="1115.389" data-end="1118.45">are you have access to two realms the</span> <span data-start="1118.45" data-end="1120.25">server realm which is the root realm and</span> <span data-start="1120.25" data-end="1123.97">then your own plugin realm everything</span> <span data-start="1123.97" data-end="1126.37">you add inside the plugin will be</span> <span data-start="1126.37" data-end="1129.399">faulted the local realm this is how for</span> <span data-start="1129.399" data-end="1131.559">example the view manager works so if you</span> <span data-start="1131.559" data-end="1134.32">define a view manager in two plugins and</span> <span data-start="1134.32" data-end="1135.639">you load them and they each have their</span> <span data-start="1135.639" data-end="1138.669">own templates with same name but but</span> <span data-start="1138.669" data-end="1141.85">conflicting meaning today it works fine</span> <span data-start="1141.85" data-end="1143.5">because internally happy will go and</span> <span data-start="1143.5" data-end="1145.389">resolve it with basically a private</span> <span data-start="1145.389" data-end="1148.84">version of realms in 80 it's done</span> <span data-start="1148.84" data-end="1152.2">basically by putting the view manager in</span> <span data-start="1152.2" data-end="1154">the right realm and then the rouse</span> <span data-start="1154" data-end="1156.01">default to that so I'm not expecting</span> <span data-start="1156.01" data-end="1157.419">older like completely follow what I'm</span> <span data-start="1157.419" data-end="1158.769">saying right now I've been playing with</span> <span data-start="1158.769" data-end="1161.399">this for you know for six months now but</span> <span data-start="1161.399" data-end="1163.72">if you really want to see how it works</span> <span data-start="1163.72" data-end="1165.85">and how it's being used go to the vision</span> <span data-start="1165.85" data-end="1169.779">module which is the view manager and see</span> <span data-start="1169.779" data-end="1171.01">how it's implemented it's basically</span> <span data-start="1171.01" data-end="1175.36">using realms all the way it's it's</span> <span data-start="1175.36" data-end="1177.58">really why fully had to expose the</span> <span data-start="1177.58" data-end="1180.94">concept outlet in public API in future</span> <span data-start="1180.94" data-end="1181.96">version what I really want to do is</span> <span data-start="1181.96" data-end="1183.82">enhance it to allow you to completely</span> <span data-start="1183.82" data-end="1185.559">sandbox your plugin as much as its</span> <span data-start="1185.559" data-end="1187.69">reasonable within one server so that's</span> <span data-start="1187.69" data-end="1192.46">that's realms another one another big</span> <span data-start="1192.46" data-end="1194.47">change that I mean it's probably not</span> <span data-start="1194.47" data-end="1195.97">gonna be a breakage for most people but</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1195.97" data-end="1197.889">I think it's been causing a lot of pain</span> <span data-start="1197.889" data-end="1200.309">who people is logging</span> <span data-start="1200.309" data-end="1203.379">longing it's been very very noisy and</span> <span data-start="1203.379" data-end="1205.21">it's been very hard for people to say</span> <span data-start="1205.21" data-end="1207.22">hey look the longer facility is nice but</span> <span data-start="1207.22" data-end="1209.139">like happy generating so much logging</span> <span data-start="1209.139" data-end="1211.09">noise that if I'm trying to also add my</span> <span data-start="1211.09" data-end="1213.309">app noise to it and then the filtering</span> <span data-start="1213.309" data-end="1216.129">is it's just too much going on so we did</span> <span data-start="1216.129" data-end="1218.08">a couple things one we split log into</span> <span data-start="1218.08" data-end="1219.429">internal logging now has its own and</span> <span data-start="1219.429" data-end="1222.519">meet emitter event then your app logging</span> <span data-start="1222.519" data-end="1224.73">so those are two split now so if you</span> <span data-start="1224.73" data-end="1227.409">subscribe to request you're only going</span> <span data-start="1227.409" data-end="1228.94">to get when you call request log you'll</span> <span data-start="1228.94" data-end="1230.35">get those events you're not going to get</span> <span data-start="1230.35" data-end="1231.519">all the internal stuff at happy</span> <span data-start="1231.519" data-end="1234.549">generates I got rid of about half of the</span> <span data-start="1234.549" data-end="1236.139">internal logging that works just stupid</span> <span data-start="1236.139" data-end="1239.35">not adding any value clean up all the</span> <span data-start="1239.35" data-end="1242.62">other the tags for the event so now you</span> <span data-start="1242.62" data-end="1244.57">can actually and also document all of</span> <span data-start="1244.57" data-end="1246.789">them so now there's a page and I api doc</span> <span data-start="1246.789" data-end="1249.389">that tells you every single event that</span> <span data-start="1249.389" data-end="1252.159">happy will admit internally and you can</span> <span data-start="1252.159" data-end="1254.529">now see if you want to subscribe it or</span> <span data-start="1254.529" data-end="1257.139">not and what to do about it's a lot</span> <span data-start="1257.139" data-end="1260.98">quieter and and the last one it's a it's</span> <span data-start="1260.98" data-end="1262.629">a small one that read has been waiting</span> <span data-start="1262.629" data-end="1265.96">for for a long time and that's the bring</span> <span data-start="1265.96" data-end="1268.629">your own bring your own listener so</span> <span data-start="1268.629" data-end="1272.649">basically we have the node HTTP server</span> <span data-start="1272.649" data-end="1275.2">and you know first of all their their</span> <span data-start="1275.2" data-end="1276.789">their new ones now they're you know</span> <span data-start="1276.789" data-end="1278.83">there's one for speedy HTTP two people</span> <span data-start="1278.83" data-end="1280.33">want to have different implementation of</span> <span data-start="1280.33" data-end="1283.029">this of the of the HDP listener and as</span> <span data-start="1283.029" data-end="1284.44">long as they've compatible API with a</span> <span data-start="1284.44" data-end="1286.84">node one why shouldn't you able to use</span> <span data-start="1286.84" data-end="1289.059">it up until now happy create its own it</span> <span data-start="1289.059" data-end="1291.549">was internal it only exposes after the</span> <span data-start="1291.549" data-end="1293.11">fact so if you did serve that listener</span> <span data-start="1293.11" data-end="1295.75">you can get the actual node object but</span> <span data-start="1295.75" data-end="1297.519">there was no way to affect that but and</span> <span data-start="1297.519" data-end="1300.909">also happy kinda like you know required</span> <span data-start="1300.909" data-end="1303.639">to start it its own listener it will not</span> <span data-start="1303.639" data-end="1305.08">allow you to do anything with it and</span> <span data-start="1305.08" data-end="1306.909">their environments where your your</span> <span data-start="1306.909" data-end="1309.25">deployment requires you to actually do</span> <span data-start="1309.25" data-end="1310.899">something else if you have an</span> <span data-start="1310.899" data-end="1313.169">environment like the yellow environment</span> <span data-start="1313.169" data-end="1316.12">it's a platform feature so you provide</span> <span data-start="1316.12" data-end="1318.309">the platform with a HTTP server and the</span> <span data-start="1318.309" data-end="1319.929">platform called listen on it with their</span> <span data-start="1319.929" data-end="1322">own their own port then they find and</span> <span data-start="1322" data-end="1323.649">that allows them to hook it in the right</span> <span data-start="1323.649" data-end="1325.299">routing tables and the route load</span> <span data-start="1325.299" data-end="1329.169">balancers and security purposes so now</span> <span data-start="1329.169" data-end="1331.36">you can do that and my hope is that</span> <span data-start="1331.36" data-end="1333.43">beyond just the deployment feature</span> <span data-start="1333.43" data-end="1335.53">well this will give people it also means</span> <span data-start="1335.53" data-end="1337.42">that people can experiment with</span> <span data-start="1337.42" data-end="1341.74">alternative forms of transport so you</span> <span data-start="1341.74" data-end="1344.35">can try to run happy with speedy to with</span> <span data-start="1344.35" data-end="1346.75">speedy over it with a CP 2 and see see</span> <span data-start="1346.75" data-end="1349.98">what that looks like without having</span> <span data-start="1349.98" data-end="1352.12">happy to die natively support those</span> <span data-start="1352.12" data-end="1356.38">features and again the goal is really to</span> <span data-start="1356.38" data-end="1358.15">enable people to do more on their own</span> <span
