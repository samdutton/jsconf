data-end="330.77">overnight so what do you do if you're</span> <span data-start="330.77" data-end="332.75">lazy like me you will go on the internet</span> <span data-start="332.75" data-end="334.58">and find a lot of libraries that can</span> <span data-start="334.58" data-end="336.5">help you I don't want to build my</span> <span data-start="336.5" data-end="338.81">calendar of you again I don't have two</span> <span data-start="338.81" data-end="341.09">miles maybe somebody olej build it for</span> <span data-start="341.09" data-end="343.76">me right so that's exactly what you're</span> <span data-start="343.76" data-end="345.17">going to do probably you will use</span> <span data-start="345.17" data-end="346.85">something like a package as for</span> <span data-start="346.85" data-end="348.56">type-ahead search you will render your</span> <span data-start="348.56" data-end="351.35">views with that component for calendar</span> <span data-start="351.35" data-end="353.57">you will use full calendar jquery plugin</span> <span data-start="353.57" data-end="356.21">for SVG gasps you'll use some library</span> <span data-start="356.21" data-end="358.58">like this vijay's this is a data table</span> <span data-start="358.58" data-end="360.92">that needs sorting and everything I</span> <span data-start="360.92" data-end="363.59">don't know if if somebody already did it</span> <span data-start="363.59" data-end="365.18">for me efficiently I'll just use their</span> <span data-start="365.18" data-end="368.69">code so here you have several components</span> <span data-start="368.69" data-end="370.96">and they built with entirely different</span> <span data-start="370.96" data-end="373.76">frameworks sorry libraries and they</span> <span data-start="373.76" data-end="376.28">built with entirely different teams this</span> <span data-start="376.28" data-end="378.65">code doesn't have any idea how to work</span> <span data-start="378.65" data-end="381.74">with each other and yeah like you can</span> <span data-start="381.74" data-end="385.19">use something else for this line so my</span> <span data-start="385.19" data-end="387.11">point is you have all the things you</span> <span data-start="387.11" data-end="388.88">need to glue together how do you do that</span> <span data-start="388.88" data-end="392.03">and just to give you another example</span> <span data-start="392.03" data-end="395.419">here's google calendar in case you think</span> <span data-start="395.419" data-end="397.16">oh you just synchronize your data model</span> <span data-start="397.16" data-end="398.95">for every component it's not true</span> <span data-start="398.95" data-end="400.47">sometimes you</span> <span data-start="400.47" data-end="402.69">and on the state of the component so</span> <span data-start="402.69" data-end="405.21">here on the left side you have this box</span> <span data-start="405.21" data-end="407.13">where you can select some weak arbitrary</span> <span data-start="407.13" data-end="410.49">range of days in your calendar and that</span> <span data-start="410.49" data-end="412.5">would be reflected on the right side so</span> <span data-start="412.5" data-end="415.23">it's not even like data that comes for</span> <span data-start="415.23" data-end="418.5">user it's something that is stored as a</span> <span data-start="418.5" data-end="423.03">state of the component so let's say you</span> <span data-start="423.03" data-end="425.37">start developing that but you know this</span> <span data-start="425.37" data-end="427.38">thing depends on that saying blind</span> <span data-start="427.38" data-end="429.33">showed up down only if this constraints</span> <span data-start="429.33" data-end="431.73">are satisfied you will do some graph</span> <span data-start="431.73" data-end="433.29">dependency graph like this by the way</span> <span data-start="433.29" data-end="434.73">it's not real graph I just made it up</span> <span data-start="434.73" data-end="439.26">but the point is it might be simple in</span> <span data-start="439.26" data-end="441.57">the beginning but more features you have</span> <span data-start="441.57" data-end="444.87">in your applications more different</span> <span data-start="444.87" data-end="447.57">directions the activity will go to or</span> <span data-start="447.57" data-end="449.61">dependencies will go to it will be</span> <span data-start="449.61" data-end="451.05">harder to manage and maybe you don't</span> <span data-start="451.05" data-end="453.66">need to is our job really managing</span> <span data-start="453.66" data-end="456.81">dependencies probably not so you may end</span> <span data-start="456.81" data-end="458.7">up with something like this it's all</span> <span data-start="458.7" data-end="460.53">complicated goes back and forth you</span> <span data-start="460.53" data-end="462.33">manage events here you pushes they're</span> <span data-start="462.33" data-end="465.6">like what's going on so that's why we</span> <span data-start="465.6" data-end="468.3">built a small library called tracker</span> <span data-start="468.3" data-end="470.52">it's under two kilobytes when gzipped</span> <span data-start="470.52" data-end="472.08">and minified is really small and lean</span> <span data-start="472.08" data-end="474.63">and the point is to make any code</span> <span data-start="474.63" data-end="477.39">deactive you just wrap whatever code you</span> <span data-start="477.39" data-end="479.55">have into one function call it just</span> <span data-start="479.55" data-end="480.9">instantly becomes the active at what I</span> <span data-start="480.9" data-end="483.03">mean is every time some dependency</span> <span data-start="483.03" data-end="484.83">changes of that function or like that</span> <span data-start="484.83" data-end="488.16">block it will just sound again so the</span> <span data-start="488.16" data-end="490.74">purpose is just to you know glue things</span> <span data-start="490.74" data-end="494.729">together and here's an example a code</span> <span data-start="494.729" data-end="497.58">example you just put your stuff into</span> <span data-start="497.58" data-end="500.07">this checker-outer on and alternate</span> <span data-start="500.07" data-end="501.66">means it will run again at the game</span> <span data-start="501.66" data-end="504.9">again every time something changes so</span> <span data-start="504.9" data-end="507.33">here's another example let's say I have</span> <span data-start="507.33" data-end="509.4">a

<p><span data-start="509.4" data-end="511.919">Francisco that's wearing form and we</span> <span data-start="511.919" data-end="516.51">paint both casting from this city so so</span> <span
