data-end="169.48">we really kit really care about this</span> <span data-start="169.48" data-end="171.97">well back in the olden days once upon a</span> <span data-start="171.97" data-end="173.29">time we used to build these nice</span> <span data-start="173.29" data-end="174.76">distributed systems and if you scratch</span> <span data-start="174.76" data-end="176.32">underneath the surface of the internet</span> <span data-start="176.32" data-end="178.72">you still find a few of them around and</span> <span data-start="178.72" data-end="180.1">they've been around for a hell of a long</span> <span data-start="180.1" data-end="182.47">time for example DNS this is something</span> <span data-start="182.47" data-end="183.85">that was built in the 80s and yet it's</span> <span data-start="183.85" data-end="187.42">so critical to what we're doing and then</span> <span data-start="187.42" data-end="189.66">we've we've thrown a lot of that away</span> <span data-start="189.66" data-end="192.64">we're in the cyst this world where we're</span> <span data-start="192.64" data-end="196.51">being told like how we can and can't</span> <span data-start="196.51" data-end="200.44">build against other peoples api's and</span> <span data-start="200.44" data-end="204.19">what we can do and this this kind of</span> <span data-start="204.19" data-end="206.14">reminds me of the the old days where we</span> <span data-start="206.14" data-end="208.78">had we had the mainframe and you know</span> <span data-start="208.78" data-end="210.61">you had to connect in and both of us</span> <span data-start="210.61" data-end="212.59">remember like you have all your data on</span> <span data-start="212.59" data-end="215.14">a centralized system and you were</span> <span data-start="215.14" data-end="216.97">totally beholden to somebody else on how</span> <span data-start="216.97" data-end="219.25">you would interact with this stuff and</span> <span data-start="219.25" data-end="221.56">then along came the pc and suddenly</span> <span data-start="221.56" data-end="222.67">everybody could do everything and</span> <span data-start="222.67" data-end="224.08">there's this huge like wave of</span> <span data-start="224.08" data-end="225.85">innovation that happened in the bedroom</span> <span data-start="225.85" data-end="228.73">in the home in the office everywhere and</span> <span data-start="228.73" data-end="230.5">we've kind of lost that we've lost a lot</span> <span data-start="230.5" data-end="232.63">of that and what I want to talk to you</span> <span data-start="232.63" data-end="234.07">about today is how do we get some of</span> <span data-start="234.07" data-end="235.45">that back how do we go back to the</span> <span data-start="235.45" data-end="237.1">future and start building and designing</span> <span data-start="237.1" data-end="239.23">these these distributed systems and for</span> <span data-start="239.23" data-end="241.06">that we need protocols because protocols</span> <span data-start="241.06" data-end="243.61">let us agree on a sort of common way on</span> <span data-start="243.61" data-end="247.989">how we can interact and the other super</span> <span data-start="247.989" data-end="249.73">cool thing about this is when we can</span> <span data-start="249.73" data-end="252.94">push the sort of innovation out so</span> <span data-start="252.94" data-end="255.13">instead of being on a centralized like</span> <span data-start="255.13" data-end="257.169">team in the middle controlling what we</span> <span data-start="257.169" data-end="258.88">can can't do when we when we can all</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="261.519">work on the edge of the system then the</span> <span data-start="261.519" data-end="263.62">amount of innovation really explodes</span> <span data-start="263.62" data-end="268.39">like the pc exploded so Robert Scoble</span> <span data-start="268.39" data-end="272.32">has this interesting analogy it's called</span> <span data-start="272.32" data-end="274.15">the ice cream of the internet and we</span> <span data-start="274.15" data-end="278.08">have we have this like super cool step</span> <span data-start="278.08" data-end="280.72">like things happening right now we have</span> <span data-start="280.72" data-end="282.25">a phone in our pockets where we can like</span> <span data-start="282.25" data-end="283.81">pull it out and we've got the entire</span> <span data-start="283.81" data-end="285.7">world's information at our fingertips we</span> <span data-start="285.7" data-end="287.35">can take photos and they magically</span> <span data-start="287.35" data-end="288.91">appear on certain websites or you can</span> <span data-start="288.91" data-end="291.22">swipe up and Google now tells you where</span> <span data-start="291.22" data-end="291.849">to go</span> <span data-start="291.849" data-end="294.129">and we're living in this like super</span> <span data-start="294.129" data-end="296.709">super cool world of really cool stuff</span> <span data-start="296.709" data-end="301.479">happening but we're not really asking</span> <span data-start="301.479" data-end="304.779">ourselves like do we want to be sharing</span> <span data-start="304.779" data-end="306.429">all of this public this information</span> <span data-start="306.429" data-end="308.8">publicly now I don't want to stand up in</span> <span data-start="308.8" data-end="310.929">front of you and say look centralized is</span> <span data-start="310.929" data-end="313.959">bad decentralized is good I think the</span> <span data-start="313.959" data-end="315.969">the answer to that is is far more</span> <span data-start="315.969" data-end="321.399">nuanced the yogi berra says you know</span> <span data-start="321.399" data-end="322.629">when you come to the fork in the road</span> <span data-start="322.629" data-end="325.539">you take it centralized definitely</span> <span data-start="325.539" data-end="326.919">hazard advantages like if you think</span> <span data-start="326.919" data-end="329.529">about Facebook they came along and say</span> <span data-start="329.529" data-end="331.589">it had to sit there and design a</span> <span data-start="331.589" data-end="334.24">distributed system distributed is really</span> <span data-start="334.24" data-end="336.219">hard like when you don't control all the</span> <span data-start="336.219" data-end="338.709">nodes on the network it's it's a tough</span> <span data-start="338.709" data-end="340.779">problem to solve like nodes go down how</span> <span data-start="340.779" data-end="342.279">do you resynchronize messages things</span> <span data-start="342.279" data-end="346.629">like that so but but we also know that</span> <span data-start="346.629" data-end="349.269">that decentralized kind of wins in the</span> <span data-start="349.269" data-end="352.269">long term like the car decentralized</span> <span data-start="352.269" data-end="354.49">model the GSM protocol it's</span> <span data-start="354.49" data-end="360.129">decentralized pc again email so we did</span> <span data-start="360.129" data-end="362.649">solve this with email email is is in</span> <span data-start="362.649" data-end="364.779">many ways pretty fantastic protocols</span> <span data-start="364.779" data-end="366.729">been around for 30 years like there's</span> <span data-start="366.729" data-end="368.05">not many people who can write an app and</span> <span data-start="368.05" data-end="371.499">say yeah my apps okay maybe PHP but very</span> <span data-start="371.499" data-end="373.449">few systems have been around for as long</span> <span data-start="373.449" data-end="377.8">as something like email and it it works</span> <span data-start="377.8" data-end="380.259">well because people can innovate on</span> <span data-start="380.259" data-end="381.639">different areas of the stack you can</span> <span data-start="381.639" data-end="382.929">innovate on the server you can innovate</span> <span data-start="382.929" data-end="385.149">on the client there's a sub gentleman's</span> <span data-start="385.149" data-end="387.129">agreement on how it should work this is</span> <span data-start="387.129" data-end="391.36">codified up into protocols and rfcs but</span> <span data-start="391.36" data-end="394.539">there's also well we know it's it's</span> <span data-start="394.539" data-end="396.459">insecure client to server is pretty</span> <span data-start="396.459" data-end="398.379">secure but server to server as we're</span> <span data-start="398.379" data-end="399.849">finding out from some of the Snowden</span> <span data-start="399.849" data-end="401.979">stuff is is pretty damn insecure it's</span> <span data-start="401.979" data-end="405.849">completely clear text the other thing if</span> <span data-start="405.849" data-end="407.289">you think about email is like it could</span> <span data-start="407.289" data-end="410.139">be so much better if you if you get an</span> <span data-start="410.139" data-end="412.449">email message imagine you're getting an</span> <span data-start="412.449" data-end="414.939">invoice if this invoice was tagged up</span> <span data-start="414.939" data-end="417.309">and dealt was the right way it wouldn't</span> <span data-start="417.309" data-end="418.719">land in your inbox you wouldn't have to</span> <span data-start="418.719" data-end="420.339">process it would just magically go to</span> <span data-start="420.339" data-end="421.959">your accounting software or to your</span> <span data-start="421.959" data-end="424.93">accountant and seriously this is</span> <span data-start="424.93" data-end="428.47">is a bit broken and let me let me just</span> <span data-start="428.47" data-end="430.15">share one other piece of brokenness and</span> <span data-start="430.15" data-end="431.35">then we'll think about how do we fix</span> <span data-start="431.35" data-end="434.949">this so the other part is like we have</span> <span data-start="434.949" data-end="436.509">all of these services these are great</span> <span data-start="436.509" data-end="438.19">services so let us do super awesome</span> <span data-start="438.19" data-end="440.05">things but why do we have to have three</span> <span data-start="440.05" data-end="442.96">different accounts on these systems to</span> <span data-start="442.96" data-end="444.34">be able to post and go to these</span> <span data-start="444.34" data-end="446.05">different sites to post and we never</span> <span data-start="446.05" data-end="448.539">have these comments coming back we're</span> <span data-start="448.539" data-end="449.979">pretty smart people I'm sure we all</span> <span data-start="449.979" data-end="451.93">agree that the stuff could be a little</span> <span data-start="451.93" data-end="456.94">bit better so let's think about how do</span> <span data-start="456.94" data-end="458.56">we build this better and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="458.56" data-end="460.24">share with you some of the things that</span> <span data-start="460.24" data-end="462.21">that myself and my team have been</span> <span data-start="462.21" data-end="464.229">thinking about some of the problems we</span> <span data-start="464.229" data-end="465.97">face and how we've we've come up with</span> <span data-start="465.97" data-end="470.41">them we know that the system has to have</span> <span data-start="470.41" data-end="473.229">structured messages you know if you're</span> <span data-start="473.229" data-end="476.07">passing messages around between systems</span> <span data-start="476.07" data-end="479.259">you kind of wanted to be tagged up in</span> <span data-start="479.259" data-end="481.75">the right way so this is like the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="481.75" data-end="484.9">Activity Feed format that's some subject</span> <span data-start="484.9" data-end="488.02">object verb so so-and-so tag so-and-so</span> <span data-start="488.02" data-end="491.979">in southern size photo so that's a good</span> <span data-start="491.979" data-end="493.69">starting point and that's sort of some</span> <span data-start="493.69" data-end="494.83">of the stuff that we're starting to</span> <span data-start="494.83" data-end="497.74">think about we definitely want to</span> <span data-start="497.74" data-end="499.3">distribute it anybody should be able to</span> <span data-start="499.3" data-end="501.55">host it should be reliable and it should</span> <span data-start="501.55" data-end="505.659">be easy to implement so in terms of</span> <span data-start="505.659" data-end="508.539">thinking like how do we use protocols to</span> <span data-start="508.539" data-end="512.32">design a system where anybody can run it</span> <span data-start="512.32" data-end="515.44">and anybody can build apps on it and all</span> <span data-start="515.44" data-end="517.87">of these different apps and systems will</span> <span data-start="517.87" data-end="520.24">intercommunicate the first thing we need</span> <span data-start="520.24" data-end="522.37">to think about is how do we how do we</span> <span data-start="522.37" data-end="524.44">deal with addressing like you know</span> <span data-start="524.44" data-end="526.029">there's been some social networks that</span> <span data-start="526.029" data-end="528.7">have said your identity on this on this</span> <span data-start="528.7" data-end="532.57">network is like a URL that sort of works</span> <span data-start="532.57" data-end="535.69">okay but people really sort of think</span> <span data-start="535.69" data-end="539.77">about their email addresses as an</span> <span data-start="539.77" data-end="542.2">identity so we we took the assumption</span> <span data-start="542.2" data-end="545.17">that email

<span data-start="891.77" data-end="895.4">there's the freedom box from the from</span> <span data-start="895.4" data-end="899.12">the Debian guys pump is a pretty cool</span> <span

data-end="908.66">the and yet guys are doing some pretty</span> <span data-start="908.66" data-end="911.48">awesome stuff with building lots of</span> <span data-start="911.48" data-end="914.33">small

is that we get</span> <span data-start="923.18" data-end="924.98">involved with standards committees like</span> <span data-start="924.98" data-end="926.27">when you're building your apps think</span> <span data-start="926.27" data-end="927.62">about it if this is something that can</span> <span data-start="927.62" data-end="931.91">be really like pushed to a broader</span> <span data-start="931.91" data-end="935.99">audience however there's a big warning</span> <span data-start="935.99" data-end="937.37">about standards committees there's two</span> <span data-start="937.37"

data-end="942.68">who enjoys being on a standards</span> <span data-start="942.68" data-end="945.07">committee and enjoys writing specs and</span> <span data-start="945.07" data-end="947.3">these are people you really really want</span> <span data-start="947.3" data-end="949.31">to avoid do not go near them they're</span> <span data-start="949.31" data-end="953.81">toxic we try to take the other approach</span> <span data-start="953.81" data-end="956.57">we try to like build software generalize</span> <span data-start="956.57" data-end="957.35">it and</span> <span data-start="957.35" data-end="958.88">then come back and this is so much more</span> <span data-start="958.88" data-end="961.79">powerful because the first group of</span> <span data-start="961.79" data-end="963.59">people really think about how the world</span> <span data-start="963.59" data-end="964.88">should be and I think it's so much</span> <span data-start="964.88" data-end="966.35">better to accept the world as it is and</span> <span data-start="966.35" data-end="968.42">then build stuff and we discovered that</span> <span data-start="968.42" data-end="970.94">this the hard way we we sort of designed</span> <span data-start="970.94" data-end="973.16">something we found them we had about a</span> <span data-start="973.16"

back</span> <span data-start="980.99" data-end="982.49">and change this back and change the</span> <span data-start="982.49" data-end="985.19">protocol to to put in some more sensible</span> <span
