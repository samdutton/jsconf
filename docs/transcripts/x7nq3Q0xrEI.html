data-end="372.56">like a lot of node applications is like</span> <span data-start="372.56" data-end="374.9">500 line index file we've like huge</span> <span data-start="374.9"

data-end="381.71">so you wanted to keep that clean from</span> <span data-start="381.71" data-end="383.75">start and so first I anything that</span> <span data-start="383.75" data-end="385.19">wasn't config or like plugin</span> <span data-start="385.19" data-end="387.65">registration into a plugin and so it</span> <span data-start="387.65" data-end="389.75">gives you a nice neat starting place and</span> <span data-start="389.75" data-end="391.159">then everything inside the plugin gives</span> <span data-start="391.159" data-end="393.65">a context and then the plugins were</span> <span

<span data-start="434.09" data-end="435.2">that says a lot about the nobody</span> <span data-start="435.2" data-end="437.45">consistent and the happy ecosystem is</span> <span data-start="437.45" data-end="442.16">all and so sure what that looks like and</span> <span data-start="442.16" data-end="446.5">so this is a new happy eight syntax and</span> <span data-start="446.5" data-end="448.46">that's pretty straightforward you'd</span> <span data-start="448.46" data-end="450.05">require a happy module create your</span> <span data-start="450.05" data-end="453.59">server
