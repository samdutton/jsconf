data-start="14.099" data-end="20.58">about javascript in space well I got all</span> <span data-start="20.58" data-end="22.71">right so uh yeah twitter handles d</span> <span data-start="22.71" data-end="23.939">harden if you want to follow me for bad</span> <span data-start="23.939" data-end="27.269">tweets I got him so space like I really</span> <span data-start="27.269" data-end="29.07">like space I get really geeked out about</span> <span data-start="29.07" data-end="31.109">it so if I get all like giggly during</span> <span data-start="31.109" data-end="32.55">this talk it's because I think space is</span> <span data-start="32.55" data-end="35.16">so cool but I'm not really smart enough</span> <span data-start="35.16" data-end="36.78">to be like a rocket scientist or like an</span> <span data-start="36.78" data-end="40.26">astronaut or something so like if you're</span> <span data-start="40.26" data-end="41.73">interested in space and you want to like</span> <span data-start="41.73" data-end="43.649">learn about like what can you do like</span> <span data-start="43.649" data-end="49.35">what can just like whoever do so one day</span> <span data-start="49.35" data-end="51.51">at work we were having a hackathon who's</span> <span data-start="51.51" data-end="53.789">ever done a hackathon yeah lots of</span> <span data-start="53.789" data-end="56.01">people holy crap ok so there's usually</span> <span data-start="56.01" data-end="57.719">like a theme like oh we're gonna like</span> <span data-start="57.719" data-end="60.329">work on you know something with like AWS</span> <span data-start="60.329" data-end="61.89">so we're gonna like solve this problem</span> <span data-start="61.89" data-end="64.229">they didn't set a theme to this one so</span> <span data-start="64.229" data-end="65.4">we were like alright man we're gonna</span> <span data-start="65.4" data-end="67.56">like do a weather balloon and we're</span> <span data-start="67.56" data-end="68.88">going to take this weather balloon and</span> <span data-start="68.88" data-end="70.92">we're going to get it like super high in</span> <span data-start="70.92" data-end="72.299">the air as high as we can get and we're</span> <span data-start="72.299" data-end="73.53">going to take a picture the earth and</span> <span data-start="73.53" data-end="77.52">it's going to be awesome spoilers it</span> <span data-start="77.52" data-end="79.979">didn't quite go that way but it was</span> <span data-start="79.979" data-end="83.43">still pretty good so the deal is you</span> <span data-start="83.43" data-end="85.049">could just get a weather balloon and</span> <span data-start="85.049" data-end="86.549">they can go up to like a hundred</span> <span data-start="86.549" data-end="88.86">thousand feet easy which isn't</span> <span data-start="88.86" data-end="90.689">technically space but for the purposes</span> <span data-start="90.689" data-end="94.2">of this talk it's space okay alright</span> <span data-start="94.2" data-end="99.27">cool so we just needed to get this thing</span> <span data-start="99.27" data-end="101.4">up there but more importantly we need to</span> <span data-start="101.4" data-end="103.38">get it back so there's a variety of</span> <span data-start="103.38" data-end="105.78">problems with that like number one okay</span> <span data-start="105.78" data-end="107.13">we can strap it to the balloon that's</span> <span data-start="107.13" data-end="110.1">that's probably fine but like can you</span> <span data-start="110.1" data-end="111.57">drop a GoPro from like a hundred</span> <span data-start="111.57" data-end="114.509">thousand feet and it's okay maybe I</span> <span data-start="114.509" data-end="116.729">don't know and then once you've done</span> <span data-start="116.729" data-end="118.979">that like how do you figure out where</span> <span data-start="118.979" data-end="121.979">the hell the thing went you can't really</span> <span data-start="121.979" data-end="123.36">see a balloon that's a hundred thousand</span> <span data-start="123.36" data-end="127.61">feet in the air we tried so here was a</span> <span data-start="127.61" data-end="130.08">kind of a step-by-step process of what</span> <span data-start="130.08" data-end="133.319">we were working on we found a box and we</span> <span data-start="133.319" data-end="138.959">hole in it and shut up we just like okay</span> <span data-start="138.959" data-end="141.48">so we've got a box we got a GoPro we</span> <span data-start="141.48" data-end="143.7">have a scale let's just try and figure</span> <span data-start="143.7" data-end="145.409">this thing out so we kind of went on</span> <span data-start="145.409" data-end="147.689">amazon prime i was a three-day hackathon</span> <span data-start="147.689" data-end="149.549">so we kind of had like a day for the</span> <span data-start="149.549" data-end="152.489">idea a day to like order the things and</span> <span data-start="152.489" data-end="154.2">then like a day to actually do the thing</span> <span data-start="154.2" data-end="156.209">so we were we were super super pressed</span> <span data-start="156.209" data-end="159.09">for time so someone kindly donated a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="159.09" data-end="162.03">GoPro that was like almost certain to be</span> <span data-start="162.03" data-end="165.15">destroyed so good for them we bought a</span> <span data-start="165.15" data-end="166.68">parachute we bought a weather balloon</span> <span data-start="166.68" data-end="168.06">they're like twenty bucks it's kind of</span> <span data-start="168.06" data-end="170.25">surprising how cheap they are we bought</span> <span data-start="170.25" data-end="172.139">some like paracord and then we're like</span> <span data-start="172.139" data-end="173.34">okay well just lap all these things</span> <span data-start="173.34" data-end="177.09">together and it'll totally work we had</span> <span data-start="177.09" data-end="179.79">to do like math which I'm not very good</span> <span data-start="179.79" data-end="182.699">at but with you know whatever turns out</span> <span data-start="182.699" data-end="184.53">the really tricky part with making a</span> <span data-start="184.53" data-end="187.68">balloon is like there's websites like</span> <span data-start="187.68" data-end="189.419">hab hub is a really good website you can</span> <span data-start="189.419" data-end="191.099">figure out like here's my payload and</span> <span data-start="191.099" data-end="193.049">then like if I put this much helium in</span> <span data-start="193.049" data-end="194.4">the balloon it's going to go up this</span> <span data-start="194.4" data-end="196.469">fast and then like the prevailing wind</span> <span data-start="196.469" data-end="198.349">conditions and blah blah below my god</span> <span data-start="198.349" data-end="200.22">you just want to figure out where the</span> <span data-start="200.22" data-end="201.84">balloons going to go and they go for a</span> <span data-start="201.84" data-end="204.599">really really long time so we kind of</span> <span data-start="204.599" data-end="207.509">did our best to figure it out so we live</span> <span data-start="207.509" data-end="209.25">in Las Vegas which is in the middle of</span> <span data-start="209.25" data-end="210.9">the Mojave Desert so there's a lot of</span> <span data-start="210.9" data-end="212.819">nothing which is good if you want to</span> <span data-start="212.819" data-end="214.349">like launch a balloon and not land it in</span> <span data-start="214.349" data-end="216.569">like somebody's yard which was kind of</span> <span data-start="216.569" data-end="219.78">what we're trying to avoid so we kind of</span> <span data-start="219.78" data-end="222.569">got everything together we did a little</span> <span data-start="222.569" data-end="224.189">research on how we were going to track</span> <span data-start="224.189" data-end="227.489">it and we came up with kind of a kind of</span> <span data-start="227.489" data-end="229.259">sort of compromise solution so like I</span> <span data-start="229.259" data-end="230.699">said we only had a couple days to do</span> <span data-start="230.699" data-end="233.939">this in four teams that do this</span> <span data-start="233.939" data-end="236.31">regularly or professionally they use a</span> <span data-start="236.31" data-end="239.819">standard called a PRS spoilers this is</span> <span data-start="239.819" data-end="243.239">going to come up later it's a actually</span> <span data-start="243.239" data-end="246.479">an amateur radio thing that you can use</span> <span data-start="246.479" data-end="247.799">to track the balloon it sends out</span> <span data-start="247.799" data-end="249.12">packets that say hey I'm here I'm here</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="249.12" data-end="251.28">I'm here we didn't have time to do that</span> <span data-start="251.28" data-end="252.989">because you need to actually have a ham</span> <span data-start="252.989" data-end="256.169">radio license they even use it so what</span> <span data-start="256.169" data-end="257.31">we did was we bought something called a</span> <span data-start="257.31" data-end="259.829">spot GPS it's used for like climbers if</span> <span data-start="259.829" data-end="261.15">they're you know lost on a mountain</span> <span data-start="261.15" data-end="262.409">somewhere they can push the button it'll</span> <span data-start="262.409" data-end="265.889">tell you where you are the spot GPS was</span> <span data-start="265.889" data-end="267.22">like two hundred dollars</span> <span data-start="267.22" data-end="268.72">something and we figured like we could</span> <span data-start="268.72" data-end="270.4">probably return it as long as it didn't</span> <span data-start="270.4" data-end="272.83">like plummet to the ground and explode</span> <span data-start="272.83" data-end="275.11">so we're making a lot of assumptions</span> <span data-start="275.11" data-end="277.65">here about like will the parachute work</span> <span data-start="277.65" data-end="282.82">so here's our completed spacecraft</span> <span data-start="282.82" data-end="285.39">spacecraft because it's going to space</span> <span data-start="285.39" data-end="287.74">we painted it pink so it would be really</span> <span data-start="287.74" data-end="290.44">easy to see we put a nice note on it</span> <span data-start="290.44" data-end="292.18">that said hey this isn't a bomb it's</span> <span data-start="292.18" data-end="294.64">like a science experiment we just wanted</span> <span data-start="294.64" data-end="296.32">it to be really friendly looking because</span> <span data-start="296.32" data-end="297.91">if it did land in someone's yard we</span> <span data-start="297.91" data-end="300.39">didn't want like the cops get called</span> <span data-start="300.39" data-end="303.97">here's a very scientific diagram of how</span> <span data-start="303.97" data-end="307.57">it works the gist of it is it's</span> <span data-start="307.57" data-end="309.55">incredibly not complex we have a box</span> <span data-start="309.55" data-end="312.58">with some stuff in it like a GoPro we've</span> <span data-start="312.58" data-end="314.41">got a line going up to a parachute and</span> <span data-start="314.41" data-end="316.96">that gets attached to the balloon so as</span> <span data-start="316.96" data-end="319.03">the balloon Rises in the air the air</span> <span data-start="319.03" data-end="320.41">pressure drops the balloon gets bigger</span> <span data-start="320.41" data-end="322.36">and bigger and bigger at some point the</span> <span data-start="322.36" data-end="325.09">balloon pops that's kind of your really</span> <span data-start="325.09" data-end="326.68">limiting factor as the balloon gets too</span> <span data-start="326.68" data-end="329.74">big and pops so the idea was this</span> <span data-start="329.74" data-end="331.84">balloon would go up it would pop it</span> <span data-start="331.84" data-end="333.46">would fall and then the parachute would</span> <span data-start="333.46" data-end="335.14">just happily open up and then everything</span> <span data-start="335.14" data-end="338.5">would be perfect for ever and it was our</span> <span data-start="338.5" data-end="342.56">initial process just like impossible to</span> <span data-start="342.57" data-end="344.71">just all right to the ground it didn't</span> <span data-start="344.71" data-end="347.56">work at all we tried like maybe maybe</span> <span data-start="347.56" data-end="362.86">for like a second it was nighttime you</span> <span data-start="362.86" data-end="365.14">know we did her best so it wasn't like</span> <span data-start="365.14" data-end="368.74">incredibly encouraging but the parachute</span> <span data-start="368.74" data-end="370.09">did open up a little bit so that's</span> <span data-start="370.09" data-end="371.919">enough right besides wouldn't leave</span> <span data-start="371.919" data-end="375.31">three days so we're going for it so none</span> <span data-start="375.31" data-end="377.46">of us had a truck so we rented a truck</span> <span data-start="377.46" data-end="381.49">we rented a tank of helium we were going</span> <span data-start="381.49" data-end="384.94">to start with hydrogen so there's like a</span> <span data-start="384.94" data-end="386.74">helium shortage right and we felt like</span> <span data-start="386.74" data-end="388.21">oh we don't to contribute to the helium</span> <span data-start="388.21" data-end="389.71">shortage and it's probably expensive so</span> <span data-start="389.71" data-end="392.8">like hydrogen all works super well so it</span> <span data-start="392.8" data-end="394.54">will like hydrogen will absolutely lift</span> <span data-start="394.54" data-end="397">your balloon really well but like it</span> <span data-start="397" data-end="400.89">also did that for like the Hindenburg</span> <span data-start="400.9" data-end="403.66">but you know so we went to the place</span> <span data-start="403.66" data-end="406">where they sell compress air and we said</span> <span data-start="406" data-end="407.05">oh we'd like to get some hydrogen</span> <span data-start="407.05" data-end="408.55">they're like yeah totally great whatever</span> <span data-start="408.55" data-end="411.28">and he's like did you know that when you</span> <span data-start="411.28" data-end="414.52">open the tank of hydrogen it immediately</span> <span data-start="414.52" data-end="416.919">combust and it's so hot that you can't</span> <span data-start="416.919" data-end="419.05">see it but if you run your hand through</span> <span data-start="419.05" data-end="420.75">it it burns all your skin off and</span> <span data-start="420.75" data-end="422.59">there's just like a guy sitting behind</span> <span data-start="422.59" data-end="424.84">the counter he's like but we like to go</span> <span data-start="424.84" data-end="426.16">to the desert and fill balloons and</span> <span data-start="426.16" data-end="427.6">shoot them and they explode really good</span> <span data-start="427.6" data-end="430.18">and we kind of said well we're really</span> <span data-start="430.18" data-end="433.449">trying to not explode like ideally we</span> <span data-start="433.449" data-end="436.479">don't want it to explode so turns out we</span> <span data-start="436.479" data-end="437.979">could get some helium which was really</span> <span data-start="437.979" data-end="441.699">good so we threw this sucker into the</span> <span data-start="441.699" data-end="444.16">tank of our truck and took off to the</span> <span data-start="444.16" data-end="447.43">desert on the way we were attacked by</span> <span data-start="447.43" data-end="449.05">dust devils because the desert is</span> <span data-start="449.05" data-end="451.6">terrifying we also went to a really</span> <span data-start="451.6" data-end="453.13">weird McDonald's with this amazing wall</span> <span data-start="453.13" data-end="455.25">art it's got nothing to do with this but</span> <span data-start="455.25" data-end="459.55">take take it in for a second so this is</span> <span data-start="459.55" data-end="461.259">a picture of kind of where we were it</span> <span data-start="461.259" data-end="462.88">this is just an untouched picture it</span> <span data-start="462.88" data-end="464.77">just looks like that absolutely gorgeous</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="464.77" data-end="468.43">Joshua trees whatever so we get out</span> <span data-start="468.43" data-end="472.69">there right and ideally you would have</span> <span data-start="472.69" data-end="474.699">some type of regulator that would tell</span> <span data-start="474.699" data-end="476.8">you like here's how fast the helium's</span> <span data-start="476.8" data-end="478.9">going and like then you can figure out</span> <span data-start="478.9" data-end="480.43">like how much is in the balloon like</span> <span data-start="480.43" data-end="481.93">maybe have a little scale to measure the</span> <span data-start="481.93" data-end="485.08">lift we didn't have any of that but we</span> <span data-start="485.08" data-end="487.69">did figure that one of the people on our</span> <span data-start="487.69" data-end="489.909">team julian he could kind of hug about</span> <span data-start="489.909" data-end="492.4">this big and that's probably about how</span> <span data-start="492.4" data-end="494.74">big it needed to be so we just filled</span> <span data-start="494.74" data-end="496.21">the balloon up until Julian could hug it</span> <span data-start="496.21" data-end="500.77">we met we measured in Julian hugs so we</span> <span data-start="500.77" data-end="503.229">kind of did the problem was it was</span> <span data-start="503.229" data-end="505.27">absurdly windy just ridiculously windy</span> <span data-start="505.27" data-end="508.479">so this balloon is going crazy and they</span> <span data-start="508.479" data-end="511.479">are ridiculously thin we wouldn't have</span> <span data-start="511.479" data-end="513.31">lunch if we had any time to actually</span> <span data-start="513.31" data-end="516.07">think about this but we kind of had to</span> <span data-start="516.07" data-end="519.88">so here's our intrepid team its helium</span> <span data-start="519.88" data-end="521.95">don't worry it's okay he didn't actually</span> <span data-start="521.95" data-end="523.18">breathe a knee in he mighta breathe a</span> <span data-start="523.18" data-end="526.42">little in don't worry about it so we're</span> <span data-start="526.42" data-end="528.04">filling this balloon we're like super</span> <span data-start="528.04" data-end="529.81">excited we drove out for about an hour</span> <span data-start="529.81" data-end="532.42">and a half we'd had at this point almost</span> <span data-start="532.42" data-end="534.58">three days of solid work we've invested</span> <span data-start="534.58" data-end="536.17">our own money we got this stupid helium</span> <span data-start="536.17" data-end="539.64">tank we didn't die to the hydrogen and</span> <span data-start="539.64" data-end="543.46">this is basically what happened so it</span> <span data-start="543.46" data-end="547.39">exploded on the ground like right here</span> <span data-start="547.39" data-end="550.81">so we got the balloon filled up all the</span> <span data-start="550.81" data-end="552.94">way that it needed to be the only thing</span> <span data-start="552.94" data-end="555.88">we had to do was let go the wind blew it</span> <span data-start="555.88" data-end="558.67">onto my face and then my sunglasses</span> <span data-start="558.67" data-end="562.09">caused it to explode so it was like over</span> <span data-start="562.09" data-end="564.25">in an instant like bang balloons popped</span> <span data-start="564.25" data-end="566.38">and we're just kind of standing there</span> <span data-start="566.38" data-end="569.59">like did this really happen you know how</span> <span data-start="569.59" data-end="571.18">like rubber gloves they're covered in</span> <span data-start="571.18" data-end="573.34">like powder the powder was like shoot</span> <span data-start="573.34" data-end="575.05">like honor it looked like a cartoon like</span> <span data-start="575.05" data-end="576.61">just powder shoots in our eyes and we're</span> <span data-start="576.61" data-end="579.67">just like okay well did we get a backhoe</span> <span data-start="579.67" data-end="580.9">we didn't get a backup balloon of course</span> <span data-start="580.9" data-end="583.69">we didn't that's crazy talk and so that</span> <span data-start="583.69" data-end="588.76">was like really sad so you know come</span> <span data-start="588.76" data-end="590.38">monday we're doing like a demo of our</span> <span data-start="590.38" data-end="592.24">like awesome hackathon we're like yeah</span> <span data-start="592.24" data-end="595.36">we we got this balloon and we were going</span> <span data-start="595.36" data-end="596.47">to send it up there we were going to</span> <span data-start="596.47" data-end="597.73">take pictures you'd be able to see like</span> <span data-start="597.73" data-end="599.08">the curve of the earth and like that's</span> <span data-start="599.08" data-end="600.73">amazing where are the pictures and we</span> <span data-start="600.73" data-end="604.06">said we got some cool pictures of the</span> <span data-start="604.06" data-end="608.29">ground so we didn't really want to give</span> <span data-start="608.29" data-end="611.37">up right because we got we got so close</span> <span data-start="611.37" data-end="614.23">but outside of the bounds of the hack of</span> <span data-start="614.23" data-end="617.5">time that the hackathon hack of time we</span> <span data-start="617.5" data-end="620.05">we actually had time to kind of get our</span> <span data-start="620.05" data-end="625">together so we all got a ham radio</span> <span data-start="625" data-end="629.32">together so we all got a ham radio licenses hey I didn't expect that to</span> <span data-start="629.32" data-end="630.88">happen I didn't think that would be part</span> <span data-start="630.88" data-end="633.01">of like launching a weather balloon but</span> <span data-start="633.01" data-end="635.98">you know you kind of get into it so the</span> <span data-start="635.98" data-end="637.78">four of us like learned every bike what</span> <span data-start="637.78" data-end="639.04">we needed to know about amateur radio</span> <span data-start="639.04" data-end="641.83">and like did a lot of studying and took</span> <span data-start="641.83" data-end="643.87">a test and so now we've all got call</span> <span data-start="643.87" data-end="646.48">signs and like amateur radios and we</span> <span data-start="646.48" data-end="648.16">were playing around with ham radios and</span> <span data-start="648.16" data-end="649.9">this thing just completely spiraled out</span> <span data-start="649.9" data-end="652.69">of control we forgot to bring to helium</span> <span data-start="652.69" data-end="654.46">that tank back so we lost our deposit</span> <span data-start="654.46" data-end="657.55">and basically we were in this thing at</span> <span data-start="657.55" data-end="659.47">this point like okay we've got to do</span> <span data-start="659.47" data-end="663.67">something so we figured out like hey</span> <span data-start="663.67" data-end="667.24">okay we've got our ham radio licenses so</span> <span data-start="667.24" data-end="668.38">we can actually use</span> <span data-start="668.38" data-end="671.08">aprs to track this balloon so how are we</span> <span data-start="671.08" data-end="674.2">going to do that enter project con pollo</span> <span data-start="674.2" data-end="678.07">that's a very technical name a friend</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="678.07" data-end="679.75">Pavel who is also part of the team</span> <span data-start="679.75" data-end="682.27">created this it's out there on github</span> <span data-start="682.27" data-end="684.46">it's just mock and I his username / gian</span> <span data-start="684.46" data-end="688.12">paolo what this guy is is a little</span> <span data-start="688.12" data-end="690.49">library that runs on a Raspberry Pi and</span> <span data-start="690.49" data-end="692.86">gathers data and handles sending the</span> <span data-start="692.86" data-end="695.16">aprs signal and all that good stuff</span> <span data-start="695.16" data-end="699.58">totally custom totally awesome so it</span> <span data-start="699.58" data-end="702.1">took us forever to like actually get all</span> <span data-start="702.1" data-end="704.47">of this together but at this point we're</span> <span data-start="704.47" data-end="706.63">feeling kind of good like hey we're</span> <span data-start="706.63" data-end="708.09">actually going to do this the right way</span> <span data-start="708.09" data-end="710.08">as opposed to just kind of throwing</span> <span data-start="710.08" data-end="712.54">stuff together for a hackathon here's a</span> <span data-start="712.54" data-end="715.51">picture of the payload kg 70 x is</span> <span data-start="715.51" data-end="718.92">popples call sign I'm kg 70 YF now</span> <span data-start="718.92" data-end="723.22">dashana there also has one like I said</span> <span data-start="723.22" data-end="725.11">we didn't expect it in this project with</span> <span data-start="725.11" data-end="727.2">ham radio licenses but you know whatever</span> <span data-start="727.2" data-end="729.43">you can see the Raspberry Pi there as</span> <span data-start="729.43" data-end="731.05">well as an array of sensors we took like</span> <span data-start="731.05" data-end="733.15">temperature data humidity that kind of</span> <span data-start="733.15" data-end="737.17">thing so we you know after quite a lot</span> <span data-start="737.17" data-end="739.42">of false starts it took like a year for</span> <span data-start="739.42" data-end="740.71">us to actually get everybody on the same</span> <span data-start="740.71" data-end="743.77">page but one day we decided like let's</span> <span data-start="743.77" data-end="747.76">just do it so all of us got together we</span> <span data-start="747.76" data-end="750.43">met up and we just kind of hacked and</span> <span data-start="750.43" data-end="752.14">put it together and we said okay let's</span> <span data-start="752.14" data-end="754.84">let's launch this thing here's a picture</span> <span data-start="754.84" data-end="757.65">of the the new and improved spacecraft</span> <span data-start="757.65" data-end="760.99">we made it really shiny which is not</span> <span data-start="760.99" data-end="763.03">only cool because it's shiny it's really</span> <span data-start="763.03" data-end="765.4">good because airplanes radars can see</span> <span data-start="765.4" data-end="767.11">that better we didn't think about that</span> <span data-start="767.11" data-end="769">before so it may be a good thing that we</span> <span data-start="769" data-end="771.97">didn't like launch in the air if you're</span> <span data-start="771.97" data-end="773.77">curious if your payloads under like four</span> <span data-start="773.77" data-end="775.68">pounds you don't have to tell the FAA</span> <span data-start="775.68" data-end="779.32">which is cool because I don't know if</span> <span data-start="779.32" data-end="781.57">they would have loved this or not but uh</span> <span data-start="781.57" data-end="783.4">so we've got our cool spacecraft we've</span> <span data-start="783.4" data-end="786.72">got our hardware it's running JavaScript</span> <span data-start="786.72" data-end="789.01">awesome so we head out to the desert</span> <span data-start="789.01" data-end="792.82">we've actually got pictures this time we</span> <span data-start="792.82" data-end="794.71">drove out to approximately the middle of</span> <span data-start="794.71" data-end="797.77">nowhere and we got our helium tank that</span> <span data-start="797.77" data-end="801.31">we now own whatever</span> <span data-start="801.31" data-end="803.83">we got a wii another thing we figured</span> <span data-start="803.83" data-end="806.23">was that if we had like a sheet maybe we</span> <span data-start="806.23" data-end="807.7">could hold the balloon down it wouldn't</span> <span data-start="807.7" data-end="811.21">go so crazy so we just kind of got all</span> <span data-start="811.21" data-end="812.92">of us together and started inflating</span> <span data-start="812.92" data-end="814.9">this thing and we still didn't really</span> <span data-start="814.9" data-end="816.73">have a means of measuring how big it</span> <span data-start="816.73" data-end="817.99">needed to be so we just tried to</span> <span data-start="817.99" data-end="821.22">remember how big Julian can hug and just</span> <span data-start="821.22" data-end="826.29">sort of went with that ended</span> <span data-start="826.3" data-end="829.49">you can see tie you down here laying</span> <span data-start="829.49" data-end="830.78">under the balloon trying to tie the</span> <span data-start="830.78" data-end="833.57">thing together you can see our parachute</span> <span data-start="833.57" data-end="836.09">just kind of hang in there despite our</span> <span data-start="836.09" data-end="837.68">best efforts and how professional we</span> <span data-start="837.68" data-end="838.94">were feeling we were totally still</span> <span data-start="838.94" data-end="844.09">hacking this ham radio licenses or not</span> <span data-start="844.09" data-end="847.07">so we inflated to where we thought it</span> <span data-start="847.07" data-end="850.43">needed to be we tied it down and we just</span> <span data-start="850.43" data-end="854.27">let it go and it actually took off and</span> <span data-start="854.27" data-end="857.35">didn't explode in our faces this time</span> <span data-start="857.35" data-end="860.69">here it is in flight and it actually</span> <span data-start="860.69" data-end="864.56">took off so we were kind of just stunned</span> <span data-start="864.56" data-end="867.02">you can look at this stupid expression</span> <span data-start="867.02" data-end="871.67">on my face like that's the look that's</span> <span data-start="871.67" data-end="873.53">the look of a man who had had a balloon</span> <span data-start="873.53" data-end="875.21">explode in his face before and can't</span> <span data-start="875.21" data-end="878.12">believe that it's off the ground have</span> <span data-start="878.12" data-end="879.77">you had also been there for the original</span> <span data-start="879.77" data-end="882.44">and was equally stunned ty had not and</span> <span data-start="882.44" data-end="883.94">he just looks like he's walking away</span> <span data-start="883.94" data-end="888.29">like from an explosion like he's like</span> <span data-start="888.29" data-end="890">the coolest guy ever in this picture and</span> <span data-start="890" data-end="895.16">we're just like ghoul what so anyway we</span> <span data-start="895.16" data-end="897.38">calculated that I'll leave that up for a</span> <span data-start="897.38" data-end="900.26">minute we calculated that this balloon</span> <span data-start="900.26" data-end="902.6">was going to take like I forget like an</span> <span data-start="902.6" data-end="907.76">hour to to actually go up and land and</span> <span data-start="907.76" data-end="909.79">so we just kind of had to kill time so</span> <span data-start="909.79" data-end="912.95">you know I let me tell you about this so</span> <span data-start="912.95" data-end="916.43">there's a website called a PR SFI if you</span> <span data-start="916.43" data-end="918.77">are transmitting a PRS signals using</span> <span data-start="918.77" data-end="920.96">amateur radio you can just type in your</span> <span data-start="920.96" data-end="922.31">call sign and you can see where the</span> <span data-start="922.31" data-end="924.29">thing is that was the other amazing</span> <span data-start="924.29" data-end="926.36">thing is that that actually worked so we</span> <span data-start="926.36" data-end="929.06">could see this balloon overlaid on</span> <span data-start="929.06" data-end="931.52">google maps we accidentally entered the</span> <span data-start="931.52" data-end="933.05">wrong character code and it's labeled as</span> <span data-start="933.05" data-end="935.69">a house instead of a balloon so on the</span> <span data-start="935.69" data-end="937.25">map there was this house just kind of</span> <span data-start="937.25" data-end="941.9">like floating through the air like up so</span> <span data-start="941.9" data-end="943.07">we're just kind of watching this thing</span> <span data-start="943.07" data-end="945.02">for an hour whatever so like we took off</span> <span data-start="945.02" data-end="947.12">the in and out because I don't know what</span> <span data-start="947.12" data-end="949.07">else you going to do like once we let go</span> <span data-start="949.07" data-end="950.57">there was literally nothing we could do</span> <span data-start="950.57" data-end="953.57">it was just kind of out there what was</span> <span data-start="953.57" data-end="955.46">cool was a couple of us had tweeted out</span> <span data-start="955.46" data-end="957.23">the link to follow the thing with the</span> <span data-start="957.23" data-end="959.72">radio tracker and we had a few</span> <span data-start="959.72" data-end="961.49">people who had seen that on Twitter on</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="961.49" data-end="963.019">Facebook and whatever we're keeping way</span> <span data-start="963.019" data-end="965.089">better tabs than we were so we're just</span> <span data-start="965.089" data-end="966.86">sitting there like eating burgers just</span> <span data-start="966.86" data-end="968.449">kind of whatever and they're like hey I</span> <span data-start="968.449" data-end="969.98">think it's falling and sure enough you</span> <span data-start="969.98" data-end="971.42">look at the altitude and the number had</span> <span data-start="971.42" data-end="972.709">stopped getting bigger and it started</span> <span data-start="972.709" data-end="976.43">getting a lot smaller faster so we</span> <span data-start="976.43" data-end="978.529">hopped back in the in the truck and took</span> <span data-start="978.529" data-end="983.029">off after it so what ended up happening</span> <span data-start="983.029" data-end="985.67">was this thing flew for miles and miles</span> <span data-start="985.67" data-end="986.899">and miles i'll show you a map in a</span> <span data-start="986.899" data-end="990.529">little bit and it landed like way out in</span> <span data-start="990.529" data-end="992.3">the middle of nowhere by a dry lake bed</span> <span data-start="992.3" data-end="995.72">if you noticed you probably i don't know</span> <span data-start="995.72" data-end="996.47">if you can see them on the projector</span> <span data-start="996.47" data-end="999.709">there's a lot of power lines and like a</span> <span data-start="999.709" data-end="1001.509">balloon with lots of cables and power</span> <span data-start="1001.509" data-end="1003.819">lines or like a super bad combination so</span> <span data-start="1003.819" data-end="1005.23">we were kind of terrified that this</span> <span data-start="1005.23" data-end="1007.81">thing was like out there burst into</span> <span data-start="1007.81" data-end="1011.29">flames because the thing is we lost a</span> <span data-start="1011.29" data-end="1014.379">connection to it so this thing's flying</span> <span data-start="1014.379" data-end="1015.639">in the air and it's sending out radio</span> <span data-start="1015.639" data-end="1017.829">waves right but once it gets down to</span> <span data-start="1017.829" data-end="1020.05">kind of a certain altitude it can't see</span> <span data-start="1020.05" data-end="1021.759">any more radio towers so we could only</span> <span data-start="1021.759" data-end="1024.61">track it to about 4,000 feet and then</span> <span data-start="1024.61" data-end="1028.89">it's just kind of where did it go so we</span> <span data-start="1028.89" data-end="1031.659">just drove around the desert to where we</span> <span data-start="1031.659" data-end="1035.199">kind of thought it was we found all</span> <span data-start="1035.199" data-end="1037">sorts of cool things out there like some</span> <span data-start="1037" data-end="1039.49">weird trash and like a cool cactus and</span> <span data-start="1039.49" data-end="1042.039">some tarantulas but we didn't find the</span> <span data-start="1042.039" data-end="1046.78">balloon um so we walked around until the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1046.78" data-end="1048.189">Sun went down we were out there for</span> <span data-start="1048.189" data-end="1049.62">probably two or three hours just</span> <span

data-start="1068.679" data-end="1070.539">little math and you know we could</span> <span data-start="1070.539" data-end="1073.57">actually analyze the data and we kind of</span> <span data-start="1073.57" data-end="1075.46">figured out like well maybe you know</span> <span data-start="1075.46" data-end="1077.47">looking at this map it maybe landed over</span> <span

data-end="1110.93">picture of the earth we totally took a</span> <span data-start="1110.93" data-end="1113.48">cool picture of the earth like that's</span> <span data-start="1113.48" data-end="1121.22">the friggin earth so I know it's like a</span> <span data-start="1121.22" data-end="1123.68">grainy like 640 by 480 picture but like</span> <span data-start="1123.68" data-end="1125.5">epid but it's like a real thing that's</span> <span data-start="1125.5" data-end="1128.42">the radio antenna hanging down we didn't</span> <span data-start="1128.42" data-end="1129.8">position it in a very smart place</span> <span data-start="1129.8" data-end="1133.76">compared to where the camera was so that</span> <span data-start="1133.76" data-end="1135.26">was really cool like that was enough for</span> <span data-start="1135.26" data-end="1137.99">me but Pavel kind of helped take it to</span> <span data-start="1137.99" data-end="1140.14">the next level so we actually had a</span> <span data-start="1140.14" data-end="1143.03">video and because we had this video we</span> <span data-start="1143.03" data-end="1144.92">also had the aprs data and we also had</span> <span data-start="1144.92" data-end="1147.17">the data that was gathered by the</span> <span data-start="1147.17" data-end="1150.35">onboard software so using that we were</span> <span data-start="1150.35" data-end="1153.08">able to overlay the video with where it</span> <span data-start="1153.08" data-end="1155.48">was on google maps so this is available</span> <span data-start="1155.48" data-end="1159.2">i'll send out the link and if you get</span> <span data-start="1159.2" data-end="1162.01">motion sick maybe don't watch right now</span> <span data-start="1162.01" data-end="1164.87">so this is the balloon taking off it</span> <span data-start="1164.87" data-end="1166.97">took off really fast like really really</span> <span data-start="1166.97" data-end="1171.83">hair like horrifyingly fast i'll kind of</span> <span data-start="1171.83" data-end="1173.36">skip forward to some interesting parts</span> <span data-start="1173.36" data-end="1175.49">but the cool thing is you can kind of</span> <span data-start="1175.49" data-end="1177.29">see like how long it's been the</span> <span data-start="1177.29" data-end="1179.27">temperature we were getting what the</span> <span data-start="1179.27" data-end="1182.24">altitude is which way we're facing so</span> <span data-start="1182.24" data-end="1183.89">you can see here we're at about 7,000</span> <span data-start="1183.89" data-end="1186.1">feet things are already kind of tiny</span> <span data-start="1186.1" data-end="1188.21">fast forward a little bit more 12</span> <span data-start="1188.21" data-end="1189.8">minutes and it's starting to look a lot</span> <span data-start="1189.8" data-end="1192.94">like the google map we're approaching</span> <span data-start="1192.94" data-end="1195.98">25,000 feet the temperatures 31 degrees</span> <span data-start="1195.98" data-end="1199.97">fahrenheit we can go even further we're</span> <span data-start="1199.97" data-end="1202.31">around 60,000 feet and you can see on</span> <span data-start="1202.31" data-end="1203.66">the on the map kind of where this thing</span> <span data-start="1203.66" data-end="1207.41">is going and it's just really cool to</span> <span data-start="1207.41" data-end="1209.84">actually be able to at least I think</span> <span data-start="1209.84" data-end="1212.33">it's cool to see the the video that this</span> <span data-start="1212.33" data-end="1216.56">thing took so it got to here's 80,000</span> <span data-start="1216.56" data-end="1218.78">feet which is ridiculously high let's</span> <span data-start="1218.78" data-end="1221.14">drop to negative 27 degrees Fahrenheit</span> <span data-start="1221.14" data-end="1224.45">that's Las Vegas right there that</span> <span data-start="1224.45" data-end="1227.36">kind of area right here it doesn't look</span> <span data-start="1227.36" data-end="1229.61">very cool from this high up but this is</span> <span data-start="1229.61" data-end="1231.92">actually Las Vegas and we can take the</span> <span data-start="1231.92" data-end="1233.36">google map here and kind of scroll over</span> <span data-start="1233.36" data-end="1235.01">and you can kind of match up what this</span> <span data-start="1235.01" data-end="1239.08">is next to what the google map is seeing</span> <span data-start="1239.08" data-end="1242.57">so we got 280 1000 feet we got we ended</span> <span data-start="1242.57" data-end="1246.74">up past 90,000 we got to almost exactly</span> <span data-start="1246.74" data-end="1249.17">a hundred thousand feet which we were</span> <span data-start="1249.17" data-end="1251.87">trying for like 90 or 95 and we managed</span> <span data-start="1251.87" data-end="1253.37">completely luck out that's a really good</span> <span data-start="1253.37" data-end="1255.98">view of Las Vegas if you can see that</span> <span data-start="1255.98" data-end="1259.28">long that kind of long road in the</span> <span data-start="1259.28" data-end="1263.72">middle is the strip yeah kind of neat uh</span> <span data-start="1263.72" data-end="1266.72">we face the camera facing down it would</span> <span data-start="1266.72" data-end="1268.16">have been cooler if we'd had it like at</span> <span data-start="1268.16" data-end="1270.26">an angle but again we're you know not</span> <span data-start="1270.26" data-end="1273.38">perfect at this so once we get to write</span> <span data-start="1273.38" data-end="1275.57">about a hundred thousand feet the</span> <span data-start="1275.57" data-end="1277.37">balloon pops and it starts just freaking</span> <span data-start="1277.37" data-end="1280.01">out we had absolutely no stabilization</span> <span data-start="1280.01" data-end="1282.26">or any thought into that and so this</span> <span data-start="1282.26" data-end="1283.73">thing is just kind of like flopping</span> <span data-start="1283.73" data-end="1285.8">around like this and trying to take</span> <span data-start="1285.8" data-end="1288.5">video this is kind of where I thought</span> <span data-start="1288.5" data-end="1290.03">that like a lion would break and the</span> <span data-start="1290.03" data-end="1291.44">thing we just plummet to the earth but</span> <span data-start="1291.44" data-end="1296.48">it held on so you can see that it</span> <span data-start="1296.48" data-end="1299.81">actually fell at not terminal velocity</span> <span data-start="1299.81" data-end="1301.61">which means the parachute popped that</span> <span data-start="1301.61" data-end="1303.23">was kind of the other really exciting</span> <span data-start="1303.23" data-end="1304.61">part is that it wasn't just plummeting</span> <span data-start="1304.61" data-end="1307.1">to the earth it was plummeting in a nice</span> <span
