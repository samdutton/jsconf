generators so a lot of</span> <span data-start="27.61" data-end="29.26">stuff I'm talking about it's very new so</span> <span data-start="29.26" data-end="31.63">it's very experimental it's getting into</span> <span data-start="31.63" data-end="33.46">the latest browsers but you're going to</span> <span data-start="33.46" data-end="35.05">have to enable some flags so if you're</span> <span data-start="35.05" data-end="36.82">in Firefox nightly I believe this has</span> <span data-start="36.82" data-end="39.37">just been added it's in Chrome with a</span> <span data-start="39.37" data-end="41.41">flat if you go to the flags and you can</span> <span data-start="41.41" data-end="43.78">use it in node with the — - harmony</span> <span data-start="43.78" data-end="47.32">generators flag and mice the slides are</span> <span data-start="47.32" data-end="48.489">available for this so if you want to</span> <span data-start="48.489" data-end="49.69">follow along or whatever you can get</span> <span data-start="49.69" data-end="53.68">grab those now so I'm going to start off</span> <span data-start="53.68" data-end="55.6">not really talking about promises not</span> <span data-start="55.6" data-end="56.92">really talking about asynchronous stuff</span> <span data-start="56.92" data-end="58.51">at all but talking about how you</span> <span data-start="58.51" data-end="60.91">represent a sequence so if you've got a</span> <span data-start="60.91" data-end="62.53">sequence of numbers so here we're</span> <span data-start="62.53" data-end="65.68">talking about the integers this function</span> <span data-start="65.68" data-end="68.02">returns the first n integers as an array</span> <span data-start="68.02" data-end="70.42">and that's really nice for representing</span> <span data-start="70.42" data-end="73.149">finite sequences arrays work great for</span> <span data-start="73.149" data-end="74.86">that but the integers aren't really a</span> <span data-start="74.86" data-end="76.93">finite sequence really they're an</span> <span data-start="76.93" data-end="79.06">infinite sequence but we can't have this</span> <span data-start="79.06" data-end="81.16">function returning an infinite sequence</span> <span data-start="81.16" data-end="83.56">as an array if we try and do that just</span> <span data-start="83.56" data-end="85.24">replace the condition there with true</span> <span data-start="85.24" data-end="87.49">this is trying to create an infinitely</span> <span data-start="87.49" data-end="89.65">long array so this count function is</span> <span data-start="89.65" data-end="91.659">just never going to return we're never</span> <span data-start="91.659" data-end="93.52">going to get into that for loop and</span> <span data-start="93.52" data-end="95.35">we're never going to log any output I</span> <span data-start="95.35" data-end="97.869">should just note that for oov there is a</span> <span data-start="97.869" data-end="99.88">new construct but it just loops over the</span> <span data-start="99.88" data-end="102.42">items in an array or in a sequence or it</span> <span data-start="102.42" data-end="104.32">supports a much wider range of</span> <span data-start="104.32" data-end="106.63">collections than say using a for a</span> <span data-start="106.63" data-end="111.49">traditional for loop so the next version</span> <span data-start="111.49" data-end="114.31">of JavaScript has built-in support for</span> <span data-start="114.31" data-end="117.28">these infinite collections and they it</span> <span data-start="117.28" data-end="119.83">works using it by making the function</span> <span data-start="119.83" data-end="123.04">lazy and only only executing as far as</span> <span data-start="123.04" data-end="124.72">it needs to to return the values that</span> <span data-start="124.72" data-end="127.54">are actually used so what happens with</span> <span data-start="127.54" data-end="129.759">this count function is that the function</span> <span data-start="129.759" data-end="132.85">is executed only when we request the</span> <span data-start="132.85" data-end="134.86">value so initially when you call count</span> <span data-start="134.86" data-end="137.23">none of the code inside the body is</span> <span data-start="137.23" data-end="140.799">executed then the for loop requests the</span> <span data-start="140.799" data-end="143.95">first value from count and at that point</span> <span data-start="143.95" data-end="147.07">it executes as far as that first yield</span> <span data-start="147.07" data-end="149.68">keyword and when it gets to that first</span> <span data-start="149.68" data-end="152.23">yield keyword it returns that value and</span> <span data-start="152.23" data-end="154.68">we get to use it in the for loop</span> <span data-start="154.68" data-end="157.379">but it pauses the function so it saves</span> <span data-start="157.379" data-end="159.42">the entire execution state of that</span> <span data-start="159.42" data-end="162.959">function and then when we ask for the</span> <span data-start="162.959" data-end="165.329">second value it resumes that function</span> <span data-start="165.329" data-end="167.579">from where the yield keyword was and</span> <span data-start="167.579" data-end="170.51">continues around the loop a second time</span> <span data-start="170.51" data-end="173.099">so this is really useful for infinite</span> <span data-start="173.099" data-end="175.65">sequences like this function represents</span> <span data-start="175.65" data-end="178.709">all of the integers and we can still get</span> <span data-start="178.709" data-end="181.349">back to the semantics we had before we</span> <span data-start="181.349" data-end="183.239">can just write a simple take function</span> <span data-start="183.239" data-end="186.269">that takes any infinite sequence and</span> <span data-start="186.269" data-end="189.06">takes the first n items out of that</span> <span data-start="189.06" data-end="191.069">sequence and this would work for</span> <span data-start="191.069" data-end="193.95">integers but you could equally pass the</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193.95" data-end="196.139">Fibonacci sequence as an infinite</span> <span data-start="196.139" data-end="199.139">sequence and because it's because of the</span> <span data-start="199.139" data-end="200.909">lazy nature of it we could pull off the</span> <span data-start="200.909" data-end="203.01">first 5 items the first 10 items as</span> <span data-start="203.01" data-end="206.129">needed and we can reuse this and we</span> <span data-start="206.129" data-end="207.78">could have more complicated conditions</span> <span data-start="207.78" data-end="209.819">as well it doesn't have to be the first</span> <span data-start="209.819" data-end="212.639">n items it could be all the items up</span> <span data-start="212.639" data-end="214.079">until an item that matches some</span> <span data-start="214.079" data-end="217.26">condition for example so that's really</span> <span data-start="217.26" data-end="220.709">powerful for maths and sequences and</span> <span data-start="220.709" data-end="222.989">things and later I'm going to show you</span> <span data-start="222.989" data-end="224.31">how it can be really useful for</span> <span data-start="224.31" data-end="228.51">asynchronous programming as well so to</span> <span data-start="228.51" data-end="229.799">get back to the original point of</span> <span data-start="229.799" data-end="231.689">asynchronous programming I'm going to</span> <span data-start="231.689" data-end="234.12">follow through a simple example say we</span> <span data-start="234.12" data-end="236.189">want to write a function that reads a</span> <span data-start="236.189" data-end="239.129">file and passes it as JSON and returns</span> <span data-start="239.129" data-end="241.65">the result it's a fairly simple thing</span> <span data-start="241.65" data-end="243.93">and it's a task that I'm sure many of</span> <span data-start="243.93" data-end="245.04">you have had to do at some point</span> <span data-start="245.04" data-end="246.72">especially if you're writing server-side</span> <span data-start="246.72" data-end="248.729">code would you write jar if you write</span> <span data-start="248.729" data-end="250.259">client-side code you can think of this</span> <span data-start="250.259" data-end="251.939">as just making a web request and then</span> <span data-start="251.939" data-end="255.03">parsing that is JSON nothing I'm talking</span> <span data-start="255.03" data-end="259.019">about is really specific to note the so</span> <span data-start="259.019" data-end="260.699">this function is really about as simple</span> <span data-start="260.699" data-end="262.77">as it can can be to accomplish this</span> <span data-start="262.77" data-end="265.56">functionality it takes a filename it</span> <span data-start="265.56" data-end="269.07">reads that file with utf-8 encoding so</span> <span data-start="269.07" data-end="271.409">it gets a string back and then it passes</span> <span data-start="271.409" data-end="274.56">it as JSON and returns the result if at</span> <span data-start="274.56" data-end="276.659">any point one of these methods froze an</span> <span data-start="276.659" data-end="278.789">error if the read file operation froze</span> <span data-start="278.789" data-end="281.669">an error or the JSON pars

<span data-start="285.75" data-end="288.03">some top level where we know</span> <span data-start="288.03" data-end="289.35">or information about how we should</span> <span data-start="289.35" data-end="291.87">handle it so all of the errors propagate</span> <span data-start="291.87" data-end="294.81">nicely the results return nicely and</span> <span data-start="294.81" data-end="299.01">it's a really simple function to read so</span> <span data-start="299.01" data-end="301.32">we we can make that asynchronous if we</span> <span data-start="301.32" data-end="303.12">don't make it asynchronous it's going to</span> <span data-start="303.12" data-end="305.13">block the program and nothing else is</span> <span data-start="305.13" data-end="306.63">going to happen if it's a client side</span> <span data-start="306.63" data-end="308.94">app and you do synchronous i/o then</span> <span data-start="308.94" data-end="310.68">you're going to be freezing the</span> <span data-start="310.68" data-end="311.94">application nothing's going to happen</span> <span data-start="311.94" data-end="314.1">for a while if you're doing a server and</span> <span data-start="314.1" data-end="316.5">you do synchronous i/o then you're not</span> <span data-start="316.5" data-end="317.97">going to be handling any other requests</span> <span data-start="317.97" data-end="319.8">for a while so you're going to</span> <span data-start="319.8" data-end="321.99">effectively the this server will appear</span> <span data-start="321.99" data-end="325.38">to be down to everyone else so we can</span> <span data-start="325.38" data-end="327.51">make this asynchronous just by taking a</span> <span data-start="327.51" data-end="330.3">callback so we add a second argument to</span> <span data-start="330.3" data-end="332.4">the read JSON function that's callback</span> <span data-start="332.4" data-end="335.04">and

<span data-start="369.93" data-end="371.94">it's important but it turns out to have</span> <span data-start="371.94" data-end="375.18">lots of effects down the line so we're</span> <span data-start="375.18" data-end="377.01">going from our really simple model of</span> <span data-start="377.01" data-end="379.38">having arguments as inputs to functions</span> <span data-start="379.38"

data-end="392.31">to the function it's just part of the</span> <span data-start="392.31" data-end="396.84">mechanics it's relies on pure convention</span> <span data-start="396.84" data-end="399.06">that we that we passed the error is the</span> <span data-start="399.06" data-end="401.73">first as the first argument and the</span> <span data-start="401.73"

data-end="1357.59">whenever you're throwing things throwing</span> <span data-start="1357.59" data-end="1359.21">errors gives you stack traces throwing</span> <span data-start="1359.21"
