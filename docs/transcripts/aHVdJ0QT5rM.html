and what she done is so he was</span> <span data-start="217.11" data-end="218.97">not a technical engineer so he couldn't</span> <span data-start="218.97" data-end="220.859">make the printer Jam less but what it</span> <span data-start="220.859" data-end="223.23">could do was patched the software so</span> <span data-start="223.23" data-end="225.299">that it would pull the printer see if it</span>

<span data-start="277.8" data-end="280.11">didn't seem to be surfacing so he are</span> <span data-start="280.11" data-end="286.77">surrounded and discovered that the</span> <span data-start="286.77"
