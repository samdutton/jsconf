<p><span data-start="12.08" data-end="17.3">you</span> <span data-start="17.31" data-end="20.25">my name is Reed Burke I'm on the Yui</span> <span data-start="20.25" data-end="22.259">team at Yahoo I'm going to talk to you a</span> <span data-start="22.259" data-end="23.43">little bit about a project I'm working</span> <span data-start="23.43" data-end="26.07">on which involves using node.js for</span> <span data-start="26.07" data-end="27.75">something where it isn't accessory to</span> <span data-start="27.75" data-end="30.509">something and it's also not just nodejs</span> <span data-start="30.509" data-end="32.46">and just server-side JavaScript what I'm</span> <span data-start="32.46" data-end="34.83">working on is actually with the goal of</span> <span data-start="34.83" data-end="36.87">making client-side JavaScript both</span> <span data-start="36.87" data-end="38.73">easier to use for developers as well as</span> <span data-start="38.73" data-end="41.699">just way more performant and there could</span> <span data-start="41.699" data-end="43.44">be there could be a coexistence of these</span> <span data-start="43.44" data-end="46.739">two things using Yui loader so basically</span> <span data-start="46.739" data-end="49.11">we all agree that performance of web</span> <span data-start="49.11" data-end="50.97">apps is really important right but it's</span> <span data-start="50.97" data-end="53.909">way too hard it shouldn't be though so</span> <span data-start="53.909" data-end="56.129">what something with Yui that we've had</span> <span data-start="56.129" data-end="58.53">since the third version and made a part</span> <span data-start="58.53" data-end="60.39">of its core is that everything you</span> <span data-start="60.39" data-end="62.129">should only get what you need right you</span> <span data-start="62.129" data-end="63.119">shouldn't have to load the entire</span> <span data-start="63.119" data-end="64.439">library you shouldn't have to have all</span> <span data-start="64.439" data-end="68.13">this complexity of having everything on</span> <span data-start="68.13" data-end="70.08">your page and worrying about the</span> <span data-start="70.08" data-end="72.119">additional cost of parsing all this</span> <span data-start="72.119" data-end="73.619">stuff and downloading all this stuff and</span> <span data-start="73.619" data-end="75.06">everything so you use only what you need</span> <span data-start="75.06" data-end="79.229">with Yui and apps built with it can also</span> <span data-start="79.229" data-end="81.299">leverage the same kind of thing and</span> <span data-start="81.299" data-end="82.859">that's that's kind of the whole this</span> <span data-start="82.859" data-end="86.1">whole thing that we've had with Yui but</span> <span data-start="86.1" data-end="89.49">the problem with this and that it's it's</span> <span data-start="89.49" data-end="91.35">really good for the developer but it's</span> <span data-start="91.35" data-end="93.509">not so great for and we could probably</span> <span data-start="93.509" data-end="94.89">work on making developer tools better</span> <span data-start="94.89" data-end="96.84">for this and that I'll cover this in my</span> <span data-start="96.84" data-end="99.27">talk but whenever you find this you also</span> <span data-start="99.27" data-end="101.219">find dependency management so how do you</span> <span data-start="101.219" data-end="103.74">do that well one way is with the</span> <span data-start="103.74" data-end="105.899">configurator so what we had we've had</span> <span data-start="105.899" data-end="107.009">this configurator for a really long time</span> <span data-start="107.009" data-end="109.859">since Yui to back and why to how to</span> <span data-start="109.859" data-end="111.929">loader and the idea is that you know if</span> <span data-start="111.929" data-end="113.969">you want just certain parts you can put</span> <span data-start="113.969" data-end="115.289">this in here and it tells you all the</span> <span data-start="115.289" data-end="117.119">modules that you need and it gives you a</span> <span data-start="117.119" data-end="119.189">combo URL which most people in the room</span> <span data-start="119.189" data-end="120.479">would be familiar with it's basically</span> <span data-start="120.479" data-end="124.77">just concatenated that are used by by</span> <span data-start="124.77" data-end="126.09">what you what you need and then puts it</span> <span data-start="126.09" data-end="128.789">in one URL and so one way or another</span> <span data-start="128.789" data-end="130.83">you're doing this by either a build</span> <span data-start="130.83" data-end="132.51">script that's doing this or you're using</span> <span data-start="132.51" data-end="134.069">this service or you're hosting your own</span> <span data-start="134.069" data-end="136.8">combo like service or something right I</span> <span data-start="136.8" data-end="139.53">don't think this is the answer and so</span> <span data-start="139.53" data-end="141.42">the reason for this is that manually</span> <span data-start="141.42" data-end="143.069">updating a combo URL every time you</span> <span data-start="143.069" data-end="145.47">change something isn't scalable why</span> <span data-start="145.47" data-end="147.51">isn't it scalable well you think about</span> <span data-start="147.51" data-end="149.97">it your application isn't usually just</span> <span data-start="149.97" data-end="150.69">one page</span> <span data-start="150.69" data-end="152.07">you have a lot of different parts of</span> <span data-start="152.07" data-end="153.87">your website you know you may not have a</span> <span data-start="153.87" data-end="155.49">need an autocomplete widget on every</span> <span data-start="155.49" data-end="157.02">page you may not need to have a</span> <span data-start="157.02" data-end="158.37">scrollview on every page you may not</span> <span data-start="158.37" data-end="160.92">need your own component on every page</span> <span data-start="160.92" data-end="163.02">and so you want to be able to have your</span> <span data-start="163.02" data-end="164.78">templates or parts of your application</span> <span data-start="164.78" data-end="167.66">to just include what they need right and</span> <span data-start="167.66" data-end="170.64">that I don't think it's really easy and</span> <span data-start="170.64" data-end="173.22">if it's easy if you can do it it's it's</span> <span data-start="173.22" data-end="177.99">not that great for performance so this</span> <span data-start="177.99" data-end="180.72">is the easy API that Yui 3 gives you and</span> <span data-start="180.72" data-end="182.07">there's other I'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="182.07" data-end="184.2">there's more than just Yui is not the</span> <span data-start="184.2" data-end="185.4">only library that does this there are</span> <span data-start="185.4" data-end="186.93">other ways to do it and you should be</span> <span data-start="186.93" data-end="188.94">using them and finding finding a way to</span> <span data-start="188.94" data-end="192.72">make it work but it's baked in and it's</span> <span data-start="192.72" data-end="195.42">it's scripts only have to tell the page</span> <span data-start="195.42" data-end="196.8">when it needs and so if you're using</span> <span data-start="196.8" data-end="198.57">something like this or making modules</span> <span data-start="198.57" data-end="201.15">with Yui or with something like required</span> <span data-start="201.15" data-end="204.21">at jas basically your your modules your</span> <span data-start="204.21" data-end="206.13">little JavaScript files that that do</span> <span data-start="206.13" data-end="207.99">implement specific bits of functionality</span> <span data-start="207.99" data-end="211.53">that's what defines what what's needed</span> <span data-start="211.53" data-end="213.03">on the page right so you could just</span> <span data-start="213.03" data-end="214.68">throw in the modules you want and they</span> <span data-start="214.68" data-end="216.03">can declare their own dependencies and</span> <span data-start="216.03" data-end="217.739">so that's something that's a really</span> <span data-start="217.739" data-end="220.11">great way to make an application and</span> <span data-start="220.11" data-end="222.42">it's what you guys should aspire to do</span> <span data-start="222.42" data-end="223.739">but it's not always perform it and</span> <span data-start="223.739" data-end="225.6">that's why we have people who are going</span> <span data-start="225.6" data-end="227.31">in and copy and pasting something out of</span> <span data-start="227.31" data-end="229.98">here or going in and actually you know</span> <span data-start="229.98" data-end="231.27">maybe you don't even have a nice tool</span> <span data-start="231.27" data-end="234.03">like this and you're just figuring out</span> <span data-start="234.03" data-end="236.28">how to combine this with shell scripts</span> <span data-start="236.28" data-end="238.02">or whatever and that isn't something I</span> <span data-start="238.02" data-end="239.43">think we should accept right we should</span> <span data-start="239.43" data-end="241.68">have an API that's this simple whether</span> <span data-start="241.68" data-end="243.72">it's Yui or not and it should be</span> <span data-start="243.72" data-end="247.28">something that that's also performing</span> <span data-start="247.28" data-end="250.68">and so again i want to i want to stress</span> <span data-start="250.68" data-end="252.209">that they're the reason why we use</span> <span data-start="252.209" data-end="253.95">modules and there's going to be two</span> <span data-start="253.95" data-end="255.57">great talks after mine that are going to</span> <span data-start="255.57" data-end="257.519">talk about javascript frameworks and</span> <span data-start="257.519" data-end="259.049">modules and you notice this is really</span> <span data-start="259.049" data-end="260.82">common the reason why we're doing this</span> <span data-start="260.82" data-end="263.43">is because it's you're delivering less</span> <span data-start="263.43" data-end="265.14">code it's only what your users need</span> <span data-start="265.14" data-end="267.45">right you're it's going to increase</span> <span data-start="267.45" data-end="269.04">performance because you're having less</span> <span data-start="269.04" data-end="271.47">code that's you're delivering even with</span> <span data-start="271.47" data-end="272.46">a fast connection you still need to</span> <span data-start="272.46" data-end="274.35">parse it that's especially significant</span> <span data-start="274.35" data-end="276.63">on mobile right even with fast</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="276.63" data-end="278.01">JavaScript fitting you know there's a</span> <span data-start="278.01" data-end="279.21">lot of competition with JavaScript</span> <span data-start="279.21" data-end="282.3">engines in browsers and that's great and</span> <span data-start="282.3" data-end="283.44">that is only going to continue but that</span> <span data-start="283.44" data-end="284.08">is an excuse</span> <span data-start="284.08" data-end="288.37">use the you know forgetting about</span> <span data-start="288.37" data-end="290.139">performance right it also manages</span> <span data-start="290.139" data-end="291.789">complexity so it makes things easier on</span> <span data-start="291.789" data-end="295.09">you so the problem is that yeah there</span> <span data-start="295.09" data-end="296.889">needs to be a way for things to be more</span> <span data-start="296.889" data-end="299.8">performant that's because with Yui 3 you</span> <span data-start="299.8" data-end="302.5">have the simple API but one running Yui</span> <span data-start="302.5" data-end="304.599">loader on a client side isn't free right</span> <span data-start="304.599" data-end="307.3">it actually takes it takes time it</span> <span data-start="307.3" data-end="308.68">doesn't take that long but it takes time</span> <span data-start="308.68" data-end="310.93">for these dependencies to be worked out</span> <span data-start="310.93" data-end="312.639">you also have to transfer all the</span> <span data-start="312.639" data-end="314.53">metadata about all the modules that</span> <span data-start="314.53" data-end="316.569">you're using on the page to the client</span> <span data-start="316.569" data-end="318.49">so that it knows about say when I asked</span> <span data-start="318.49" data-end="320.379">for YQL it knows that it needs some</span> <span data-start="320.379" data-end="322.479">module like Jason P it needs a module</span> <span data-start="322.479" data-end="325.93">like my order needs its sub modules or</span> <span data-start="325.93" data-end="328.509">what have you write as things that</span> <span data-start="328.509" data-end="331.419">requires and doing all that is expensive</span> <span data-start="331.419" data-end="333.969">even though you can cash we could we</span> <span data-start="333.969" data-end="334.96">could send things with far future</span> <span data-start="334.96" data-end="337.24">expires right like the for the module</span> <span data-start="337.24" data-end="339.4">metadata download and the Yui seed file</span> <span data-start="339.4" data-end="343.21">and all this parsing metadata and</span> <span data-start="343.21" data-end="345.55">calculating from it isn't cash and it</span> <span data-start="345.55" data-end="347.86">happens over and over one thing that</span> <span data-start="347.86" data-end="349.509">incidentally wasn't think that we were</span> <span data-start="349.509" data-end="350.889">trying to do to improve the performance</span> <span data-start="350.889" data-end="353.8">of Yui loader is actually take all that</span> <span data-start="353.8" data-end="356.379">metadata for say what the Yui library</span> <span data-start="356.379" data-end="357.729">and put it into some kind of local</span> <span data-start="357.729" data-end="360.039">storage mechanism and that didn't work</span> <span data-start="360.039" data-end="362.08">as well as we hoped because it turns out</span> <span data-start="362.08" data-end="363.969">that still taking it out of local</span> <span data-start="363.969" data-end="366.19">storage and then parsing this huge JSON</span> <span data-start="366.19" data-end="367.69">blob with everything that you would</span> <span data-start="367.69" data-end="370.9">possibly use takes about just as much</span> <span data-start="370.9" data-end="372.4">time as just doing the calculation with</span> <span data-start="372.4" data-end="374.639">with stuff that the way that we used to</span> <span data-start="374.639" data-end="377.919">and so basically we think we could do a</span> <span data-start="377.919" data-end="379.27">little bit better with this we think we</span> <span data-start="379.27" data-end="381.129">have an okay API and we could probably</span> <span data-start="381.129" data-end="385.15">even make tools for for you know making</span> <span data-start="385.15" data-end="387.43">modules that work with why I better as</span> <span data-start="387.43" data-end="389.11">well but you know in order to get there</span> <span data-start="389.11" data-end="391.029">we need to have a really good we don't</span> <span data-start="391.029" data-end="392.65">want to just say this is this makes it</span> <span data-start="392.65" data-end="394.389">easier on developers we want you guys to</span> <span data-start="394.389" data-end="396.49">have a reason to use it you know a</span> <span data-start="396.49" data-end="398.05">reason where it's not only just helps</span> <span data-start="398.05" data-end="399.129">you guys but it makes your website</span> <span data-start="399.129" data-end="401.11">faster and that's what I want to do with</span> <span data-start="401.11" data-end="404.11">my project I've we put Yui loader as a</span> <span data-start="404.11" data-end="407.319">web service and we call it why do I</span> <span data-start="407.319" data-end="409.629">loader server or why LS and so the first</span> <span data-start="409.629" data-end="411.009">thing this lets you do is you can you</span> <span data-start="411.009" data-end="412.959">could just pass it modules to load like</span> <span data-start="412.959" data-end="415.18">say if I want the drag drop module what</span> <span data-start="415.18" data-end="416.43">this is done is</span> </p>

data-start="906.64" data-end="909.58">the same instance of nodejs as a server</span> <span data-start="909.58" data-end="911.89">versus just putting it out in a separate</span> <span data-start="911.89" data-end="914.02">process than communicating with it over</span> <span data-start="914.02" data-end="917.08">a socket and the difference is huge so</span> <span data-start="917.08" data-end="918.52">what we're seeing is this is this is</span> <span data-start="918.52" data-end="920.32">running with two workers and this is</span> <span data-start="920.32" data-end="921.94">running with just everything in line but</span> <span data-start="921.94" data-end="923.59">with separated out the traditional</span> <span data-start="923.59" data-end="925.33">nodejs scaling way right which is just</span> <span data-start="925.33" data-end="927.61">to use spark to or cluster or something</span> <span data-start="927.61" data-end="929.68">like that for spawning different things</span> <span data-start="929.68" data-end="931.84">and this is the big part right so this</span> <span data-start="931.84" data-end="933.46">is performance we used to see taking up</span> <span data-start="933.46" data-end="935.92">to 33 or almost 4 seconds and now</span> <span data-start="935.92" data-end="937.99">everything is this nice low thing right</span> <span data-start="937.99" data-end="941.23">down here that's really nice so you want</span> <span data-start="941.23" data-end="942.64">to avoid blocking anything if you're</span> <span data-start="942.64" data-end="943.87">doing image processing working with</span> <span data-start="943.87" data-end="945.13">binary

data-start="948.579" data-end="949.899">you want to be very careful because</span> <span data-start="949.899" data-end="951.73">things will start queuing up outside of</span> <span data-start="951.73" data-end="954.279">outside of the stuff and that actually</span> <span data-start="954.279" data-end="957.699">causes memory to use it to explode like</span> <span data-start="957.699" data-end="960.36">really really bad explode on nodejs so</span> <span data-start="960.36" data-end="962.799">so we're using web workers by Peter</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="962.799" data-end="965.279">Grice and that's awesome library to use</span> <span data-start="965.279" data-end="967.089">again blowing through this stuff really</span> <span data-start="967.089" data-end="969.61">quick this isn't as interesting but what</span> <span data-start="969.61" data-end="971.47">I want to show you is this we this is</span> <span data-start="971.47" data-end="973.029">interesting just because we test the</span> <span data-start="973.029" data-end="974.23">different combinations and wasn't what</span> <span data-start="974.23" data-end="976.089">we expected instead of running one</span> <span data-start="976.089" data-end="979.149">master with 16 slaves we ran 16 Yui</span> <span data-start="979.149" data-end="981.819">workers we actually ran one master with</span> <span data-start="981.819" data-end="985.449">with a 16 masters with one Yui worker</span> <span data-start="985.449" data-end="987.069">and that wind up being most performant</span> <span data-start="987.069" data-end="988.209">because that's what you see down here in</span> <span data-start="988.209" data-end="990.759">green where we have this nice even when</span> <span data-start="990.759" data-end="992.559">we put it up to 400 requests per second</span> <span data-start="992.559" data-end="995.499">we still get a nice nice flat line with</span> <span data-start="995.499" data-end="996.73">this configuration right here that's</span> <span data-start="996.73" data-end="998.98">great and this is the improvement we</span> <span data-start="998.98" data-end="1000.66">made from this is the in line when you</span> <span data-start="1000.66" data-end="1002.879">in line things it takes 1.2 seconds on</span> <span data-start="1002.879" data-end="1005.97">our production hardware to run to run a</span> <span data-start="1005.97" data-end="1008.61">two-run just all of the different tests</span> <span data-start="1008.61" data-end="1010.339">that we have with going all over</span> <span data-start="1010.339" data-end="1012.569">different configurations of modules</span> <span data-start="1012.569" data-end="1014.429">versus this green line which is running</span> <span data-start="1014.429" data-end="1016.139">things with with one web worker so that</span> <span data-start="1016.139" data-end="1017.369">makes a big difference so you want to</span> <span data-start="1017.369" data-end="1018.899">make sure you're doing that what you</span> <span data-start="1018.899" data-end="1020.279">don't see in this graph is memory to</span> <span data-start="1020.279" data-end="1022.619">which explodes which is not good if</span> <span data-start="1022.619" data-end="1023.939">you're using long if you're doing this</span> <span data-start="1023.939" data-end="1025.829">for the long run which I encourage you</span> <span data-start="1025.829" data-end="1027.299">to when you're writing node.js stuff</span> <span data-start="1027.299" data-end="1030.449">that you go through and stress tests</span> <span data-start="1030.449" data-end="1032.88">this stuff right you want to make sure</span> <span data-start="1032.88" data-end="1034.169">that you're using something like HTTP</span> <span data-start="1034.169" data-end="1036.51">proof and that's something that was</span> <span data-start="1036.51" data-end="1038.309">written by HP it's very old there's</span> <span data-start="1038.309" data-end="1040.019">papers written about it so you know that</span> <span data-start="1040.019" data-end="1041.159">that's the kind of thing you should be</span> <span data-start="1041.159" data-end="1043.679">using node the node load works really</span> <span data-start="1043.679" data-end="1045.48">well for first stuff that's you know</span> <span data-start="1045.48" data-end="1047.189">like I've used it for stuff that's 10 30</span> <span data-start="1047.189" data-end="1049.2">minutes but what I've actually noticed</span> <span data-start="1049.2" data-end="1051.24">is when I ran a 72-hour test with no</span> <span data-start="1051.24" data-end="1053.519">load I saw that my server performance</span> <span data-start="1053.519" data-end="1055.559">was just going through the floor and</span> <span data-start="1055.559" data-end="1057.059">turns out it wasn't my server it was</span> <span data-start="1057.059" data-end="1058.47">node load right so you want to make sure</span> <span data-start="1058.47" data-end="1059.789">that you're not you're not you know</span> <span data-start="1059.789" data-end="1061.71">giving yourself grief by by using tools</span> <span data-start="1061.71" data-end="1064.139">like that are for something they're not</span> <span data-start="1064.139" data-end="1065.76">meant for right note load works really</span> <span data-start="1065.76" data-end="1067.919">really well for and gives you a lot of</span> <span data-start="1067.919" data-end="1071.34">great data for small short test runs and</span> <span data-start="1071.34" data-end="1072.539">so another thing I want to go over</span> <span data-start="1072.539" data-end="1075.179">really quick is how what we're doing to</span> <span data-start="1075.179" data-end="1077.07">test why do I use to make sure that this</span> <span data-start="1077.07" data-end="1079.289">is really robust for the release that</span> <span data-start="1079.289" data-end="1080.85">we're going to do later this year of 340</span> <span data-start="1080.85" data-end="1082.47">is use</span> <span data-start="1082.47" data-end="1084.57">box I frames for unit testing which is</span> <span data-start="1084.57" data-end="1087.09">really useful for if you need to test</span> <span data-start="1087.09" data-end="1089.7">things that require a clean browser</span> <span data-start="1089.7" data-end="1091.26">environment feature on and this is on</span> <span data-start="1091.26" data-end="1092.549">the Yui gallery so I encourage you to</span> <span data-start="1092.549" data-end="1095.64">look more into that as well some things</span> <span data-start="1095.64" data-end="1097.14">would connect you if you're curious</span> <span
