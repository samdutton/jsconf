data-end="143.81">color align and I set the width to 442</span> <span data-start="143.81" data-end="154.16">percent it worked and for the global</span> <span data-start="154.16" data-end="156.68">styles of course I used again HTML</span> <span data-start="156.68" data-end="158.48">attributes like background color V link</span> <span data-start="158.48" data-end="160.22">and

didn't use CSS</span> <span data-start="167.12" data-end="169.28">because maybe I didn't know about it or</span> <span data-start="169.28" data-end="171.59">maybe I just didn't need it but a few</span> <span data-start="171.59" data-end="173.989">years later in college I learned CSS and</span> <span data-start="173.989" data-end="175.88">all the great properties like float</span> <span

that's what I</span> <span data-start="224.59" data-end="226.45">want to talk about in the course of the</span> <span data-start="226.45" data-end="228.04">next twenty five minutes I'm going going</span> <span data-start="228.04" data-end="229.359">to show you some properties that you can</span> <span data-start="229.359" data-end="231.969">use in order to improve the</span> <span

data-end="244.239">with font size the font size for text</span> <span data-start="244.239" data-end="245.98">was in the last few years somewhere</span> <span data-start="245.98" data-end="249.79">between 14 and 18 pixels that that has</span> <span data-start="249.79" data-end="252.519">changed recently and we can see more and</span> <span data-start="252.519" data-end="254.169">more sites increasing their font sizes</span> <span data-start="254.169" data-end="256.75">for example and CSS tricks a medium that</span> <span data-start="256.75" data-end="258.82">we have a font size of 21 pixels and</span> <span data-start="258.82" data-end="261.039">that's a good thing because 16 pixels</span> <span data-start="261.039" data-end="263.46">for text is definitely not good enough</span> <span data-start="263.46" data-end="266.62">or not big enough of course it depends</span> <span data-start="266.62" data-end="269.349">on the font you're using but starting</span> <span data-start="269.349" data-end="271.66">somewhere between 18 and 20 pixels is</span> <span data-start="271.66" data-end="274.15">probably a good thing and then working</span> <span data-start="274.15" data-end="276.43">your way up from there because usually</span> <span data-start="276.43" data-end="278.44">the bigger the screen size the bigger</span> <span

<span data-start="328.71" data-end="331.33">text is by default aligned to the left</span> <span data-start="331.33" data-end="334.33">or to the right depending on the reading</span> <span

data-end="369.639">that using justified text in web design</span> <span data-start="369.639" data-end="375.039">is so 2016 so it's bad for accessibility</span> <span data-start="375.039" data-end="377.129">and it's not cool so just don't do it</span> <span data-start="377.129" data-end="383.169">please Dennis told me to say please here</span> <span data-start="383.169" data-end="385.569">we have a nice paragraph the line height</span> <span data-start="385.569" data-end="387.37">is all rights the font size is all</span> <span data-start="387.37" data-end="389.71">rights but something is odd about this</span> <span data-start="389.71" data-end="393.099">paragraph it's just too narrow not</span> <span data-start="393.099" data-end="394.9">enough words fit per line it's it's hard</span> <span data-start="394.9" data-end="398.229">to read on the other hand in this</span> <span data-start="398.229" data-end="400.81">paragraph the text is just too long the</span> <span data-start="400.81" data-end="402.819">paragraphs is too wide what's considered</span> <span data-start="402.819" data-end="405.789">ideal is a character count between 45</span> <span data-start="405.789" data-end="409.029">and 75 characters per line so that's</span> <span data-start="409.029" data-end="413.229">considered ideal yes so here for example</span> <span data-start="413.229" data-end="415.889">we have a paragraph with a maximum</span> <span data-start="415.889" data-end="418.96">maximum of about 65 characters per line</span> <span data-start="418.96" data-end="421.199">it looks nice and it's easy to read</span> <span data-start="421.199" data-end="423.339">what's cool about that is that we can</span> <span data-start="423.339" data-end="425.919">use CSS to control that we can set a max</span> <span data-start="425.919" data-end="428.55">width of this paragraph to 65 characters</span> <span data-start="428.55" data-end="431.289">the character unit has been around for</span> <span data-start="431.289" data-end="433.479">quite a while now and it's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="433.479" data-end="436.479">it represents the width of the glyph</span> <span data-start="436.479" data-end="440.289">zero in the elements font and this</span> <span data-start="440.289" data-end="442.509">paragraph for example here will only be</span> <span data-start="442.509" data-end="445.509">as big as to fit 65 characters roughly</span> <span data-start="445.509" data-end="447.46">65 characters per line so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="447.46" data-end="449.909">cool</span> <span data-start="449.919" data-end="453.55">we have or there are several pseudo</span> <span data-start="453.55" data-end="456.31">elements you can use in CSS to create</span> <span data-start="456.31" data-end="458.889">cool things two of the more popular ones</span> <span data-start="458.889" data-end="461.229">are before and after you can use before</span> <span data-start="461.229" data-end="463.81">to add content directly after the start</span> <span data-start="463.81" data-end="466.419">tag and after to add content directly</span> <span data-start="466.419" data-end="469.93">before the end tag we can do cool to</span> <span data-start="469.93" data-end="472.99">stuff we can do cool stuff using those</span> <span data-start="472.99" data-end="474.999">pseudo elements but there is one thing</span> <span data-start="474.999" data-end="477.759">we shouldn't do we should not add text</span> <span data-start="477.759"

data-end="1567.6">boring but it works we can enhance it</span> <span data-start="1567.6" data-end="1571.02">some more using flexbox and now</span> <span data-start="1571.02" data-end="1572.76">especially the lower part gets a little</span> <span data-start="1572.76" data-end="1574.29">more interesting so that's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="1574.29" data-end="1576.78">and then we can enhance it some more and</span> <span data-start="1576.78" data-end="1581">to whatever we want because grids and</span> <span data-start="1581" data-end="1583.26">what's cool about that is that we don't</span> <span data-start="1583.26" data-end="1585.12">have to write 3 or 4 different versions</span> <span data-start="1585.12" data-end="1587.64">of a site we just provide this basic</span> <span data-start="1587.64" data-end="1590.34">layout using floats and then we put grid</span> <span data-start="1590.34" data-end="1592.83">on top of that because properties like</span> <span data-start="1592.83" data-end="1594.42">display:inline-block display tab will</span> <span data-start="1594.42" data-end="1597.36">sell column properties floats don't work</span> <span data-start="1597.36" data-end="1599.49">on flags or grid items they just don't</span> <span data-start="1599.49" data-end="1602.31">have any effect so you don't have to</span> <span data-start="1602.31" data-end="1604.41">override them for browsers that support</span> <span data-start="1604.41" data-end="1608.04">grids they just simply don't do anything</span> <span data-start="1608.04" data-end="1610.53">anymore if the if they're applied to a</span> <span data-start="1610.53" data-end="1613.14">grid or flex item the only time where</span> <span data-start="1613.14" data-end="1616.77">you have probably have to use feature</span> <span data-start="1616.77" data-end="1619.68">queries is when you override widths or</span> <span data-start="1619.68" data-end="1622.38">margin something like that so that's</span> <span data-start="1622.38" data-end="1624.95">pretty cool and grid is cool but it also</span> <span data-start="1624.95" data-end="1630.96">introduces a new temptation let me show</span> <span data-start="1630.96" data-end="1632.58">you what I mean let's say we want to</span> <span data-start="1632.58" data-end="1633.75">build something like that we have a</span> <span data-start="1633.75" data-end="1635.87">heading and six items here</span> <span data-start="1635.87" data-end="1639.559">and the HTML may look like this so we</span> <span data-start="1639.559" data-end="1641.78">have a div and a heading an unordered</span> <span data-start="1641.78" data-end="1644.6">list and those six items I'm going to</span> <span data-start="1644.6" data-end="1646.43">use this big grid here again I'm going</span> <span data-start="1646.43" data-end="1648.74">to create those free columns I'm setting</span> <span data-start="1648.74" data-end="1651.29">a gap again and I'm placing the heading</span> <span data-start="1651.29" data-end="1653.42">and this is what we get</span> <span data-start="1653.42" data-end="1655.97">of course because only direct child</span> <span data-start="1655.97" data-end="1657.83">items of a grid container are laid out</span> <span data-start="1657.83" data-end="1659.87">in a grid and the direct child items are</span> <span data-start="1659.87" data-end="1662.63">the h2 and unordered list the worst</span> <span data-start="1662.63" data-end="1664.7">thing you can do is to remove the</span> <span data-start="1664.7" data-end="1666.8">unordered list and transform all the</span> <span data-start="1666.8" data-end="1668.72">divs to lists I add all the list items</span> <span data-start="1668.72" data-end="1671.39">divs you should not compromise on</span> <span data-start="1671.39" data-end="1673.85">semantics for design or deaf experience</span> <span data-start="1673.85" data-end="1678.62">reasons don't do that please please what</span> <span data-start="1678.62" data-end="1680.78">you could do is to good use display sub</span> <span data-start="1680.78" data-end="1681.29">grids</span> <span data-start="1681.29" data-end="1683.33">if you apply to an unordered list the</span> <span data-start="1683.33" data-end="1685.3">list items will behave as if they were</span> <span data-start="1685.3" data-end="1688.16">direct child items of the div themselves</span> <span data-start="1688.16" data-end="1692">unfortunately display subgrid didn't</span> <span data-start="1692" data-end="1693.05">make it into level one of the</span> <span data-start="1693.05" data-end="1695.24">specification but it will probably come</span> <span data-start="1695.24" data-end="1698.45">with level two I don't know when but we</span> <span data-start="1698.45" data-end="1701.179">hope another thing you could do is to</span> <span data-start="1701.179" data-end="1703.58">set the display to contents the contents</span> <span data-start="1703.58" data-end="1706.94">will make the lists list items behave as</span> <span data-start="1706.94" data-end="1708.71">if their parent the unordered list</span> <span data-start="1708.71" data-end="1711.41">didn't exist at all so they would behave</span> <span data-start="1711.41" data-end="1713.45">as if they were direct child items of</span> <span data-start="1713.45" data-end="1718.85">the grid container yeah no Firefox again</span> <span data-start="1718.85" data-end="1720.559">is the only browser that supports that</span> <span data-start="1720.559" data-end="1723.23">so what you ultimately have to do is to</span> <span data-start="1723.23" data-end="1725.54">define another grid in this unordered</span> <span data-start="1725.54" data-end="1728.36">list so again these blue grids three</span> <span data-start="1728.36" data-end="1730.49">columns and gap I know that's not cool</span> <span data-start="1730.49" data-end="1734.15">but it's it's something since the</span> <span data-start="1734.15" data-end="1735.83">unordered list has the same width as the</span> <span data-start="1735.83" data-end="1738.35">container you can make it span all three</span> <span data-start="1738.35" data-end="1740.03">columns and just inherit all the</span> <span data-start="1740.03" data-end="1741.77">properties so you can inherit all the</span> <span data-start="1741.77" data-end="1743.78">disparate properties it's a little nicer</span> <span data-start="1743.78" data-end="1749.03">yeah whatever it is you do don't flatten</span> <span data-start="1749.03" data-end="1751.33">the structure don't do that</span> <span data-start="1751.33" data-end="1754.64">of course that's not everything you have</span> <span data-start="1754.64" data-end="1757.37">to know about CSS and accessibility but</span> <span data-start="1757.37" data-end="1758.9">it's also more than just a starting</span> <span data-start="1758.9" data-end="1761.059">point let's say you
