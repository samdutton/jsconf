data-start="603.509" data-end="605.37">crazy levels we'd all be blinded and we</span> <span data-start="605.37" data-end="608.999">just see white that's my story anyway so</span> <span data-start="608.999" data-end="611.819">again same get the gate 1 i'm going with</span> <span data-start="611.819" data-end="614.37">this so let's go to scale 100 0 to 100</span> <span data-start="614.37" data-end="616.439">at the total lack of light where</span> <span data-start="616.439" data-end="619.68">darkness and at full-on lightness we're</span> <span data-start="619.68" data-end="622.019">all blind and we see white I'm at 50 is</span> <span data-start="622.019" data-end="623.339">like that nice sweet spot where like you</span> <span data-start="623.339" data-end="626.879">see all the colors in the room nicely ok</span> <span data-start="626.879" data-end="631.319">let's put all together so that I just</span> <span data-start="631.319" data-end="635.91">backed out hsl so hue saturation and</span> <span data-start="635.91" data-end="638.879">lightness that's why it just all stands</span> <span data-start="638.879" data-end="642.209">for so again you can kind of see how</span> <span data-start="642.209" data-end="644.22">everything ties like this is RGB down</span> <span data-start="644.22" data-end="647.279">here and this is hsl appear you can kind</span> <span data-start="647.279" data-end="649.769">of see how if I change like rotate</span> <span data-start="649.769" data-end="651.449">through is Hughes how like the RGB</span> <span data-start="651.449" data-end="653.279">values kind of move around a little bit</span> <span data-start="653.279" data-end="656.069">in a weird way goes through like some</span> <span data-start="656.069" data-end="657.75">weird permutations if I pick a color</span> <span data-start="657.75" data-end="661.139">here and like a brightness here and I</span> <span data-start="661.139" data-end="662.309">kind of so if I go to like full</span> <span data-start="662.309" data-end="666">saturation so this this pink actually</span> <span data-start="666" data-end="669.3">want to use let's use it's like blue</span> <span data-start="669.3" data-end="674.79">again so if i'm at like fulbright so if</span> <span data-start="674.79" data-end="677.22">i start down here and i slowly ramp this</span> <span data-start="677.22" data-end="679.23">up i see blue and green going up but no</span> <span data-start="679.23" data-end="682.649">red and as i keep getting further like</span> <span data-start="682.649" data-end="684.959">red finally starts to kick in and it</span> <span data-start="684.959" data-end="687.059">kind of goes higher so that it kind of</span> <span data-start="687.059" data-end="688.35">makes sense again I'm not going to be</span> <span data-start="688.35" data-end="689.97">able to tell you what color would cause</span> <span data-start="689.97" data-end="692.519">what to happen the other cool thing may</span> <span data-start="692.519" data-end="694.199">like relationship that kind of makes</span> <span data-start="694.199" data-end="695.91">sense is as you go from like full</span> <span data-start="695.91" data-end="698.309">saturation down the left saturation</span> <span data-start="698.309" data-end="699.899">these like red green and blue is kind of</span> <span data-start="699.899" data-end="703.019">all merge together which again maybe</span> <span data-start="703.019" data-end="706.16">make sense if you if you play with this</span> <span data-start="706.16" data-end="708.629">it so great so I can specify color</span> <span data-start="708.629" data-end="712.8">hopefully more intuitively than RGB to</span> <span data-start="712.8" data-end="715.8">another person so what about making</span> <span data-start="715.8" data-end="719.249">doing some stuff with those colors so</span> <span data-start="719.249" data-end="721.079">back to the original example just</span> <span data-start="721.079" data-end="724.05">lightening this orange so I have human</span> <span data-start="724.05" data-end="725.279">saturation specified</span> <span data-start="725.279" data-end="728.389">and all I do is increase the lightness</span> <span data-start="728.389" data-end="731.54">so that's a lighter version of orange</span> <span data-start="731.54" data-end="734.79">this is me at the dentist with my</span> <span data-start="734.79" data-end="737.189">hygienist Linda and my little dog Coco</span> <span data-start="737.189" data-end="739.199">who likes to go with me and make sure</span> <span data-start="739.199" data-end="742.74">that Linda's not going to mess me up and</span> <span data-start="742.74" data-end="745.499">so if I went a nice gray scale version</span> <span data-start="745.499" data-end="747.899">of this photo I would just desaturate</span> <span data-start="747.899" data-end="750.3">these colors and I get this this more</span> <span data-start="750.3" data-end="754.889">timeless photo or like in my just one</span> <span data-start="754.889" data-end="756.779">like maybe a cool washed out version i</span> <span data-start="756.779" data-end="759.629">can go to like around here so that's</span> <span data-start="759.629" data-end="761.819">great scaling a photo that's cool um and</span> <span data-start="761.819" data-end="764.339">if you saw Amy's talked yesterday about</span> <span data-start="764.339" data-end="766.079">making art or you played with the lights</span> <span data-start="766.079" data-end="769.23">in the other room this also comes up</span> <span data-start="769.23" data-end="771.749">often is they were using it yourself for</span> <span data-start="771.749" data-end="773.91">a very specific reason and that's</span> <span data-start="773.91" data-end="775.319">actually if you've ever tried to like</span> <span data-start="775.319" data-end="778.319">make a color palette with RGB it doesn't</span> <span data-start="778.319" data-end="780.959">make any sense like everything else but</span> <span data-start="780.959" data-end="783.62">if you just okay so say let's pick yeah</span> <span data-start="783.62" data-end="786.449">like a nice red all right I kind of like</span> <span data-start="786.449" data-end="788.399">this like this cool looking red right</span> <span data-start="788.399" data-end="790.74">here I like this red based on saturation</span> <span data-start="790.74" data-end="792.42">lightness values I just pick and I just</span> <span data-start="792.42" data-end="795.059">rotate through all the hues I end up</span> <span data-start="795.059" data-end="796.889">with like colors that kind of fit</span> <span data-start="796.889" data-end="800.73">together and they they they go together</span> <span data-start="800.73" data-end="802.259">if you tried to do this without you be</span> <span data-start="802.259" data-end="804.629">you end up with all these weird colors</span> <span data-start="804.629" data-end="808.17">that just don't look right okay</span> <span data-start="808.17" data-end="810">hopefully I've convinced you that hsl is</span> <span data-start="810" data-end="812.85">really awesome and you want to use it so</span> <span data-start="812.85" data-end="815.879">how do you use it so it's already kind</span> <span data-start="815.879" data-end="818.16">of everywhere you guys cough website</span> <span data-start="818.16" data-end="821.939">check out the body so this is in RGB hex</span> <span data-start="821.939" data-end="824.579">triplet if you mouse over this it even</span> <span data-start="824.579" data-end="826.05">tells you now you can shift click and</span> <span data-start="826.05" data-end="829.589">you can see all these different color</span> <span data-start="829.589" data-end="834">space things and you can edit this and</span> <span data-start="834" data-end="836.819">if I just kind of change the hue it goes</span> <span data-start="836.819" data-end="839.069">through all the hues so that's pretty</span> <span data-start="839.069" data-end="841.29">cool and so all the tools that you use</span> <span data-start="841.29" data-end="846.329">that support RGB I'm i will bet you some</span> <span data-start="846.329" data-end="848.61">money maybe not a lot of money but some</span> <span data-start="848.61" data-end="850.35">money that they will also support hsl</span> <span data-start="850.35" data-end="853.47">and CSS like sports hsl all the browsers</span> <span data-start="853.47" data-end="855.079">support hsl you can just write that out</span> <span data-start="855.079" data-end="858.87">and so there's some maybe not support</span> <span data-start="858.87" data-end="859.17">forward</span> <span data-start="859.17" data-end="861.389">a preprocessor or other thing will</span> <span data-start="861.389" data-end="864.81">actually just translate it for you okay</span> <span data-start="864.81" data-end="869.49">so ah so I was just telling you all</span> <span data-start="869.49" data-end="872.19">these cool things about hsl so if you</span> <span data-start="872.19" data-end="874.11">were to say take all the people in the</span> <span data-start="874.11"
