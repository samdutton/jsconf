brief</span> <span data-start="91.39" data-end="93.64">history of the language so in the</span> <span data-start="93.64" data-end="97.33">beginning there was mocha and it was</span> <span data-start="97.33" data-end="99.93">released and they called it live script</span> <span data-start="99.93" data-end="102.1">but the marketing gods had to be</span> <span data-start="102.1"

data-start="115.45" data-end="117.759">was a registered trademark of netscape</span> <span data-start="117.759" data-end="120.9">corporation so how about web script or</span> <span data-start="120.9"

data-end="205.209">figured like most things the best way to</span> <span data-start="205.209" data-end="207.91">learn it was to teach so I went back to</span> <span data-start="207.91" data-end="209.08">my JavaScript meet up and gave a</span> <span data-start="209.08" data-end="211.33">three-part series of in-depth talks and</span> <span data-start="211.33"

data-end="218.65">got the bright idea to introduce the s6</span> <span data-start="218.65" data-end="221.56">to the enterprise nope not that</span> <span data-start="221.56"

<p><span data-start="291.91" data-end="293.86">I piggybacked on that we published an</span> <span data-start="293.86" data-end="295.75">NPM package the teams could install and</span> <span data-start="295.75" data-end="301.15">get es6 features for free oh all good</span> <span data-start="301.15" data-end="303.79">right well that time we were also</span> <span data-start="303.79" data-end="305.77">weaning ourselves off Bower which was</span> <span data-start="305.77" data-end="307.87">the dominant package manager for the</span> <span data-start="307.87"

data-start="342.01" data-end="345.13">and that is most of them haven't been</span> <span data-start="345.13" data-end="347.17">following the spec like I have and some</span> <span data-start="347.17" data-end="348.7">of them don't even know that es6 is a</span> <span data-start="348.7" data-end="350.62">thing so I put my teaching hat back on</span> <span data-start="350.62" data-end="354.1">and I gave a condensed version of es6 in</span> <span data-start="354.1" data-end="356.59">depth for the enterprise then I used</span> <span data-start="356.59" data-end="358.3">code reviews as an opportunity to</span> <span data-start="358.3" data-end="361">suggest es6 syntax and features to solve</span> <span data-start="361" data-end="362.28">problems that were already on the table</span> <span data-start="362.28" data-end="365.14">slowly but surely it started to sink in</span> <span data-start="365.14" data-end="367.24">until a couple of months later our first</span> <span data-start="367.24" data-end="370.93">es6 code was deployed to production so</span> <span data-start="370.93" data-end="372.78">what's the big deal who cares</span> <span data-start="372.78" data-end="375.66">well we're talking about javascript</span> <span data-start="375.66" data-end="377.94">javascript is arguably the most</span> <span data-start="377.94" data-end="380.32">misunderstood language in widespread use</span> <span data-start="380.32" data-end="383.62">it's also arguably the most important by</span> <span data-start="383.62" data-end="385.78">virtue of its magnitude of deployment</span> <span data-start="385.78" data-end="388.6">alone it's not just in browsers anymore</span> <span data-start="388.6" data-end="390.4">it's been for a while now viable on the</span> <span data-start="390.4" data-end="392.35">server it's a first-class citizen in</span> <span data-start="392.35" data-end="394.63">databases automation tools and even</span> <span data-start="394.63" data-end="396.31">operating systems at this point and it's</span> <span data-start="396.31" data-end="399.25">the undisputed king of the web and it</span> <span data-start="399.25" data-end="401.34">continues to eat the rest of the world</span> <span data-start="401.34" data-end="403.93">so let's talk about what's new what's in</span> <span data-start="403.93" data-end="406.06">es6 so this was the first major update</span> <span data-start="406.06" data-end="407.86">in the languages history really since</span> <span data-start="407.86" data-end="410.17">1995 and you can break down the updates</span> <span data-start="410.17" data-end="411.43">into three broad categories</span> <span data-start="411.43" data-end="414.4">the first is syntax so this is new ways</span> <span data-start="414.4" data-end="416.41">of expressing existing behavior that the</span> <span data-start="416.41" data-end="418.449">language already has we get things like</span> <span data-start="418.449" data-end="422.08">rest spread D structuring block scoping</span> <span data-start="422.08" data-end="425.71">arrow functions and modules the second</span> <span data-start="425.71" data-end="427.3">broad category of updates are</span> <span data-start="427.3" data-end="429.49">enhancements so these are ants mints -</span> <span data-start="429.49" data-end="431.08">built-ins or the standard library in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="431.08" data-end="432.52">JavaScript so we get some updates to</span> <span data-start="432.52" data-end="435.46">strings and arrays and objects amongst</span> <span data-start="435.46" data-end="437.77">others and then the last broad category</span> <span data-start="437.77" data-end="439.75">of updates are entirely new features and</span> <span data-start="439.75" data-end="441.25">I'm going to argue later that this is</span> <span data-start="441.25" data-end="442.96">where the real meat and potatoes of es6</span> <span data-start="442.96" data-end="445.199">live these are things like symbols</span> <span data-start="445.199" data-end="449.32">generators proxies and promises it's big</span> <span data-start="449.32" data-end="451.449">it's a really large update again this</span> <span data-start="451.449" data-end="453.37">was the first major update in 20 years</span> <span data-start="453.37" data-end="455.32">of the language can't possibly cover all</span> <span data-start="455.32" data-end="456.88">of it today so I'm gonna talk about the</span> <span data-start="456.88" data-end="458.289">things that I think are kind of</span> <span data-start="458.289" data-end="458.86">important</span> <span data-start="458.86" data-end="463.33">starting with syntax so we get a you</span> <span data-start="463.33" data-end="464.949">know a step forward and what we got in</span> <span data-start="464.949" data-end="466.96">the s5 with the object literal syntax we</span> <span data-start="466.96" data-end="468.46">get method and property shorthands</span> <span data-start="468.46" data-end="470.02">computed properties these are a</span> <span data-start="470.02" data-end="472.05">no-brainer most teams have adopted these</span> <span data-start="472.05" data-end="474.639">we get default arguments that let you</span> <span data-start="474.639" data-end="476.47">provide a default for function arguments</span> <span data-start="476.47" data-end="478.69">there with me I know most modern</span> <span data-start="478.69" data-end="479.979">programming languages have default</span> <span data-start="479.979" data-end="483.34">arguments already but javis could we get</span> <span data-start="483.34" data-end="484.69">this nice little dot dot dot operator</span> <span data-start="484.69" data-end="487">and this guy has a split personality</span> <span data-start="487" data-end="489.909">its first personality is rest which</span> <span data-start="489.909" data-end="492.25">means it gathers the rest of a functions</span> <span data-start="492.25" data-end="494.56">arguments together into a true array and</span> <span data-start="494.56" data-end="496.93">lets you do real array options or</span> <span data-start="496.93" data-end="498.55">operations on this without borrowing</span> <span data-start="498.55" data-end="500.8">from a radar prototype so let you do</span> <span data-start="500.8" data-end="502.72">things like manipulate an array and then</span> <span data-start="502.72" data-end="504.909">call a base function right went the</span> <span data-start="504.909" data-end="506.26">opposite of the default value for</span> <span data-start="506.26" data-end="509.919">example now it's second personality is</span> <span data-start="509.919" data-end="511.63">spread which does the opposite it</span> <span data-start="511.63" data-end="514.779">spreads out elements in a collection if</span> <span data-start="514.779" data-end="516.88">you will here's an array with the spread</span> <span data-start="516.88" data-end="518.169">operator being used I haven't actually</span> <span data-start="518.169" data-end="520.06">seen this a lot in production last three</span> <span data-start="520.06" data-end="522.159">years now but it can also be used to</span>

data-end="721.83">lexical scope so you don't need to do</span> <span data-start="721.83" data-end="723.66">crazy things like bar that equals this</span> <span data-start="723.66" data-end="725.37">or

data-end="780.96">to it now we get something that actually</span> <span data-start="780.96" data-end="782.61">signifies the intent and is a little</span> <span data-start="782.61" data-end="783.42">easier to read</span> <span data-start="783.42" data-end="786.36">they also potentially can replace even</span> <span data-start="786.36" data-end="787.83">the simplest of templating

free and</span> <span data-start="827.91" data-end="829.2">last syntax thing I want to talk about</span> <span data-start="829.2" data-end="833.49">is modules so JavaScript up until 2015</span> <span
