graded our first green sea</span> <span data-start="657.63" data-end="662.279">server and what a note screen provides</span> <span data-start="662.279" data-end="667.05">you is access to a frame buffer in form</span> <span data-start="667.05" data-end="671.029">of a node buffer which is just a</span> <span data-start="671.029" data-end="673.709">allocated bunch of memory which presents</span> <span data-start="673.709" data-end="676.5">a frame of it just presents a pixel</span> <span data-start="676.5" data-end="679.829">array when you have worked with a canvas</span> <span data-start="679.829" data-end="681.54">on client site or canvas in the browser</span> <span data-start="681.54" data-end="683.31">you know the pixel array when you have a</span> <span data-start="683.31" data-end="686.37">2d context and you're calling the metal</span> <span data-start="686.37" data-end="689.61">get image data and accessing the data</span> <span data-start="689.61" data-end="694.05">property so then you get back kind of</span> <span data-start="694.05" data-end="695.91">array which represents the pixels in the</span> <span data-start="695.91" data-end="705.779">canvas so and that's what you get in not</span> <span data-start="705.779" data-end="710.99">screen and once you've created a server</span> <span data-start="710.99" data-end="718.5">you can listen to refresh event and that</span> <span data-start="718.5" data-end="724.319">event is fired 25 times per second you</span> <span data-start="724.319" data-end="726.63">can define that frame rate by passing it</span> <span data-start="726.63" data-end="730.939">here in that option object you can see</span> <span data-start="730.939" data-end="736.47">refresh rate 10 so that's that means</span> <span data-start="736.47" data-end="737.939">daddy with the Refresh you when it gets</span> <span data-start="737.939" data-end="745.079">fired 10 times per second and the frame</span> <span data-start="745.079" data-end="750.089">buffer the pixel array is passed to that</span> <span data-start="750.089" data-end="752.639">call back as the first argument so</span> <span data-start="752.639" data-end="760.73">that's the frame buffer</span> <span data-start="760.74" data-end="763.5">so now at that point you can put any</span> <span data-start="763.5" data-end="765.91">pixel the sources you want into that</span> <span data-start="765.91" data-end="768.16">frame buffer and it gets synced with all</span> <span data-start="768.16" data-end="770.35">the clients that are connected to the</span> <span data-start="770.35" data-end="776.2">server so I mean let's make a little</span> <span data-start="776.2" data-end="781.089">little game which just puts a white</span> <span data-start="781.089" data-end="783.01">rectangle on the screen for each client</span> <span data-start="783.01" data-end="784.75">that is connected to the VNC server and</span> <span data-start="784.75" data-end="787.54">all the connected clients can just move</span> <span data-start="787.54" data-end="795.829">their own rectangle over the screen so</span> <span data-start="795.839" data-end="798.73">so frame buffer is just a regular bother</span> <span data-start="798.73" data-end="800.91">you can put in there whatever you want</span> <span data-start="800.91" data-end="810.31">that's so we can't use for example note</span> <span data-start="810.31" data-end="814.72">canvas to draw into the buffer so let's</span> <span data-start="814.72" data-end="822.73">require no cameras of course you have to</span> <span data-start="822.73" data-end="826.9">install it first wire NPM I did that</span> <span data-start="826.9" data-end="834.94">before so let's have an array of players</span> <span data-start="834.94" data-end="838.06">that are connected to the game just an</span> <span data-start="838.06" data-end="841">arrow so when every time a new client is</span> <span data-start="841" data-end="844">gay connects to the server we create a</span> <span data-start="844" data-end="851.74">new player object I'm storing the</span> <span data-start="851.74" data-end="859.6">current position started 0-0 adding at</span> <span data-start="859.6" data-end="869.589">it to the list of players so and let us</span> <span data-start="869.589" data-end="872.17">control our rectangle with the arrow</span> <span data-start="872.17" data-end="881.83">keys so that's at some look un's on it</span> <span data-start="881.83" data-end="889.23">on key down</span> <span data-start="889.24" data-end="896.93">so we check in a switch block which key</span> <span data-start="896.93" data-end="904.79">we have breast this q sim case screen</span> <span data-start="904.79" data-end="913.31">key no chain also provides some key</span> <span data-start="913.31" data-end="915.17">constants because we don't have to know</span> <span data-start="915.17" data-end="918.47">which key fires which kick-out so you</span> <span data-start="918.47"

that's</span> <span data-start="953.05" data-end="961.31">decrease it okay and we add on for damn</span> <span data-start="961.31" data-end="969.5">it I hate text made for right okay put</span> <span data-start="969.5" data-end="982.259">you increase why not x plus</span> <span data-start="982.269" data-end="990.759">when you put a left is it okay okay and</span> <span data-start="990.759" data-end="994.069">he in the Refresh loop we draw all the</span> <span data-start="994.069" data-end="999.5">players on the canvas so first we have</span> <span data-start="999.5" data-end="1006.19">to get T now that's wrong here canis so</span> <span data-start="1006.19" data-end="1014.8">we can create a canvas 800 600 and we</span> <span data-start="1014.8" data-end="1032.02">need a context 2d ok let's clear the</span> <span data-start="1032.02" data-end="1035.799">screen first maybe that's not the most</span> <span data-start="1035.799" data-end="1040.14">efficient code but it's okay for demo I</span> <span data-start="1040.14" data-end="1058.38">sorry clear right 600</span> <span data-start="1058.39" data-end="1060.57">nope</span> <span data-start="1060.57" data-end="1065.49">okay so let's iterate through the</span> <span data-start="1065.49" data-end="1068.039">players array and throw by electric</span> <span data-start="1068.039" data-end="1071.909">rectangle for each player let's do a</span> <span data-start="1071.909" data-end="1079.94">fill style let's make them all white CDX</span> <span data-start="1079.94" data-end="1090.659">correct we're position let's make 100</span> <span data-start="1090.659" data-end="1099.389">and 100 white height said okay okay and</span> <span data-start="1099.389" data-end="1101.7">then we have to copy the pixel data out</span> <span data-start="1101.7" data-end="1104">of the canvas in India or frame buffer</span> <span data-start="1104"
