data-end="305.669">programming is higher-order functions</span> <span data-start="305.669" data-end="307.289">and that's a function that either</span> <span data-start="307.289" data-end="310.59">accepts an argument in a function as an</span> <span data-start="310.59" data-end="313.77">argument or returns a function you might</span> <span data-start="313.77" data-end="315.72">be thinking this is something along the</span> <span data-start="315.72" data-end="319.38">lines of but here's an example that</span> <span data-start="319.38" data-end="323.34">might help here tone j/s is a framework</span> <span data-start="323.34" data-end="325.259">that's built on top of the Web Audio API</span> <span data-start="325.259" data-end="328.02">and playing out here is a higher order</span> <span data-start="328.02" data-end="332.34">function it accepts a note and it</span> <span data-start="332.34" data-end="337.44">returns

both</span> <span data-start="350.699" data-end="352.5">higher-order play note because it</span> <span data-start="352.5" data-end="355.71">returns a function and add eventlistener</span> <span data-start="355.71" data-end="360.87">because it accepts a function now</span> <span data-start="360.87" data-end="363.06">manipulating arrays is an important part</span> <span data-start="363.06" data-end="365.969">of all paradigms and functional</span> <span data-start="365.969" data-end="367.38">programming has a lot of really great</span> <span data-start="367.38" data-end="370.56">tools for dealing with arrays and</span> <span data-start="370.56" data-end="372.15">there's two concepts that we already</span> <span data-start="372.15" data-end="373.56">cover that are important the</span> <span data-start="373.56" data-end="375.03">higher-order functions because each of</span> <span data-start="375.03" data-end="377.13">these methods accept a function and</span> <span data-start="377.13" data-end="378.96">immutability because each of these</span> <span data-start="378.96" data-end="382.979">methods that I'm mentioning will return</span> <span data-start="382.979" data-end="385.71">a new value rather than manipulating the</span> <span data-start="385.71" data-end="389.15">current one so array that filter it</span> <span data-start="389.15" data-end="391.5">accepts a function that's run against</span> <span data-start="391.5" data-end="394.08">every element that function receives the</span> <span data-start="394.08" data-end="396.93">element the index and the array and it</span> <span data-start="396.93" data-end="400.729">returns a subset of the original array</span> <span data-start="400.729" data-end="405.87">so we define a melody and we define a</span> <span data-start="405.87" data-end="408.72">function is high which takes a note and</span> <span data-start="408.72" data-end="412.139">returns a boolean if that value is equal</span> <span data-start="412.139" data-end="414.539">to or above middle C it is considered</span> <span data-start="414.539" data-end="419.43">high otherwise it is considered low so</span> <span data-start="419.43" data-end="422.699">high notes is the melody filtered to is</span> <span data-start="422.699" data-end="426.3">high and we get only the elements that</span> <span data-start="426.3" data-end="430.139">return a truth eval you so here we have</span> <span data-start="430.139" data-end="438.78">our unfiltered melody and when we filter</span> <span data-start="438.78" data-end="448.159">to just the high notes a regular map</span> <span data-start="448.159" data-end="450.12">accepts a function that's run against</span> <span data-start="450.12" data-end="452.639">every element as well it also accepts</span> <span data-start="452.639" data-end="454.83">the element index and array within that</span> <span data-start="454.83" data-end="457.379">flat function but rather than returning</span> <span data-start="457.379" data-end="460.05">a subset of the original array it</span> <span data-start="460.05" data-end="462.27">returns an array of the same length with</span> <span data-start="462.27" data-end="468">new values so we have our melody here</span> <span data-start="468" data-end="470.159">and we have our increment octave</span> <span data-start="470.159" data-end="474.659">function and then we map our melody to</span> <span data-start="474.659" data-end="477.27">increment Optive and now we have the a</span> <span data-start="477.27" data-end="480.27">copy of the array but with each note</span> <span data-start="480.27" data-end="490.56">incremented by one octave or the high</span> <span data-start="490.56" data-end="493.07">melody</span> <span data-start="493.08" data-end="496.949">and the last one I'll cover today is a</span> <span data-start="496.949" data-end="502.53">radar reduce and a radar reduced also</span> <span data-start="502.53" data-end="504">accepts a function that's run against</span> <span data-start="504" data-end="506.4">every element but in addition to the</span> <span data-start="506.4" data-end="509.789">accumulator I in addition to the element</span> <span data-start="509.789" data-end="511.8">index and array it also accepts an</span> <span data-start="511.8" data-end="515.25">accumulator value and it will return the</span> <span data-start="515.25" data-end="518.729">total accumulated value after passing</span> <span data-start="518.729" data-end="520.95">through every element and in some</span> <span data-start="520.95" data-end="522.69">languages this is known as fold and</span> <span data-start="522.69" data-end="527.22">accumulate and it is a more generic tool</span> <span data-start="527.22" data-end="529.31">than filter or map I often hear that</span> <span data-start="529.31" data-end="532.38">reduce takes an array and returns a</span> <span data-start="532.38" data-end="536.22">single value and this is true but I</span> <span data-start="536.22" data-end="538.25">don't consider it to be a terribly</span> <span data-start="538.25" data-end="541.589">useful distinction because all functions</span> <span data-start="541.589" data-end="544.769">in JavaScript return a single value so I</span> <span data-start="544.769" data-end="547.649">like to think of it as a generic utility</span> <span data-start="547.649" data-end="550.13">function that can return any type</span> <span data-start="550.13" data-end="554.19">whether it be another array in fact you</span> <span data-start="554.19" data-end="557.39">can write filter or map using a reduce</span> <span data-start="557.39" data-end="560.37">or it can return a single string or a</span> <span data-start="560.37" data-end="566.79">single integer so I find the best way to</span> <span data-start="566.79" data-end="572.42">learn reduce is really by by example</span> <span data-start="572.42" data-end="576.12">so here we are defining this melody with</span> <span data-start="576.12" data-end="579.209">note names and length then we have our</span> <span data-start="579.209" data-end="581.94">two length function that is going to be</span> <span data-start="581.94" data-end="584.88">passed to reduce total is the</span> <span data-start="584.88" data-end="588.75">accumulator and note is the array</span> <span data-start="588.75" data-end="592.649">element and then the function adds the</span> <span data-start="592.649" data-end="599.949">total to the value of the notes length</span> <span data-start="599.959" data-end="603.959">so length are a reduced accepts of</span> <span data-start="603.959" data-end="607.019">function and an initial value and then</span> <span data-start="607.019" data-end="609.589">the return value is the end accumulation</span> <span data-start="609.589" data-end="613.37">so starting with the initial value of 0</span> <span data-start="613.37" data-end="616.019">we go through and each notes length</span> <span data-start="616.019" data-end="619.05">that's added to the total so 0 plus</span> <span data-start="619.05" data-end="625.79">0.125 0.125 plus 0.125 is 0.25 0.375</span> <span data-start="625.79" data-end="626.85">until</span> <span data-start="626.85" data-end="628.62">we get to the total length of one point</span> <span data-start="628.62" data-end="631.74">six to five seconds so here with our</span> <span data-start="631.74" data-end="636.209">melody we get one point six two five</span> <span data-start="636.209" data-end="641.16">seconds all right now that we're done</span> <span data-start="641.16" data-end="644.13">with arrays partial application is an</span> <span data-start="644.13"
