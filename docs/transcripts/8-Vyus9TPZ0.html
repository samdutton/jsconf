data-start="1661.97" data-end="1664.04">dragging and dropping so I mean what</span> <span data-start="1664.04" data-end="1665.93">we've done here is take you know the</span> <span data-start="1665.93" data-end="1668.3">underlying representation as data and</span> <span data-start="1668.3" data-end="1670.94">we've we've created a visual interface</span> <span data-start="1670.94" data-end="1673.13">for manipulating it and you know what's</span> <span data-start="1673.13" data-end="1674.66">exciting about this I mean this is this</span> <span data-start="1674.66" data-end="1676.31">is the tool we're very excited about but</span> <span data-start="1676.31" data-end="1678.02">what's really exciting about this is</span> <span data-start="1678.02" data-end="1679.4">that when you have this kind of</span> <span data-start="1679.4" data-end="1681.2">application development model you can</span> <span data-start="1681.2" data-end="1682.73">build your own tools you can build</span> <span data-start="1682.73" data-end="1684.47">anything on top of it from manipulating</span> <span data-start="1684.47" data-end="1687.89">the code and producing the application</span> <span data-start="1687.89" data-end="1691.97">the way that you want to so you know you</span> <span data-start="1691.97" data-end="1693.59">can take this a step further to I've</span> <span data-start="1693.59" data-end="1694.82">shown you here how you have</span> <span data-start="1694.82" data-end="1696.74">you know property property filled all</span> <span data-start="1696.74" data-end="1698">the properties are exposed in this</span> <span data-start="1698" data-end="1701.269">property editor and we're using some you</span> <span data-start="1701.269" data-end="1703.49">know like met type metadata so if your</span> <span data-start="1703.49" data-end="1705.44">property is an integer you get us number</span> <span data-start="1705.44" data-end="1707.149">spinner or whatever but you could take</span> <span data-start="1707.149" data-end="1709.279">that a step further and actually create</span> <span data-start="1709.279" data-end="1712.009">a custom editor for specific kind of</span> <span data-start="1712.009" data-end="1714.259">component so here's our flow component</span> <span data-start="1714.259" data-end="1716.21">which I've selected in the component</span> <span data-start="1716.21" data-end="1718.429">declaration field I'm going to open the</span> <span data-start="1718.429" data-end="1721.309">flow editor so now we're manipulating</span> <span data-start="1721.309" data-end="1726.71">that JSON with a base your curve and you</span> <span data-start="1726.71" data-end="1729.289">can actually manipulate it just visually</span> <span data-start="1729.289" data-end="1731.69">and it's producing is that JSON like I</span> <span data-start="1731.69" data-end="1734.09">showed you earlier okay so let's see i'm</span> <span data-start="1734.09" data-end="1735.44">not sure if the connectivity is good</span> <span data-start="1735.44" data-end="1737.75">enough i'd like to try to show you what</span> <span data-start="1737.75" data-end="1739.1">that looks like when you do a live</span> <span data-start="1739.1" data-end="1744.429">preview we'll see okay that's good so</span> <span data-start="1744.429" data-end="1746.96">here's you know a live preview of that</span> <span data-start="1746.96" data-end="1750.409">application we've loaded from from the</span> <span data-start="1750.409" data-end="1759.97">authoring environment</span> <span data-start="1759.98" data-end="1763.79">and now I'm going to open up that flow</span> <span data-start="1763.79" data-end="1772.26">editor again okay watch what happens</span> <span data-start="1772.27" data-end="1775.76">we're actually seeing the application</span> <span data-start="1775.76" data-end="1778.61">change as we're editing it in a live</span> <span data-start="1778.61" data-end="1780.44">preview this is a fully functional</span> <span data-start="1780.44" data-end="1782.21">working version of the application that</span> <span data-start="1782.21" data-end="1785.21">we're just editing in real time and now</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1785.21" data-end="1786.47">I'm doing this on the same computer but</span> <span data-start="1786.47" data-end="1787.88">you can actually do this across devices</span> <span data-start="1787.88" data-end="1789.169">it works over the web we're using</span> <span data-start="1789.169" data-end="1791.66">WebSockets to propagate the changes so</span> <span data-start="1791.66" data-end="1794.39">if you were to open this preview on an</span> <span data-start="1794.39" data-end="1797.179">iPad for example and you were to edit it</span> <span data-start="1797.179" data-end="1800.6">on your computer in the editor you would</span> <span data-start="1800.6" data-end="1803.21">see the changes propagated over to the</span> <span data-start="1803.21" data-end="1805.76">other device so i mean this is this is</span> <span data-start="1805.76" data-end="1807.309">all taking advantage of the same</span> <span data-start="1807.309" data-end="1809.66">characteristics of the you know the</span> <span data-start="1809.66" data-end="1812">underlying code as data approach of our</span> <span data-start="1812" data-end="1815.51">component architecture so i think that</span> <span data-start="1815.51" data-end="1817.82">this this kind of reflects a you know a</span> <span data-start="1817.82" data-end="1819.919">potential approach to simplifying</span> <span data-start="1819.919" data-end="1823.25">application development and reducing the</span> <span data-start="1823.25" data-end="1826.49">amount of time and you know and in</span> <span data-start="1826.49" data-end="1828.799">complexity through you know this</span> <span data-start="1828.799" data-end="1830.929">component oriented model so real quick</span> <span data-start="1830.929" data-end="1833.24">to wrap up I want to show you that you</span> <span data-start="1833.24" data-end="1834.44">know where these components are coming</span> <span data-start="1834.44" data-end="1836.9">from in our montage project we have a</span> <span data-start="1836.9" data-end="1839.27">package.json file and in the</span> <span data-start="1839.27" data-end="1842.21">package.json file you can load modules</span> <span data-start="1842.21" data-end="1845.84">from npm that contain components so we</span> <span data-start="1845.84" data-end="1848.57">use NPM on the front end here and what</span> <span data-start="1848.57" data-end="1850.669">you're seeing here are the dependencies</span> <span data-start="1850.669" data-end="1852.2">of the application digit which is our</span> <span data-start="1852.2" data-end="1855.049">widget collection then montage WordPress</span> <span data-start="1855.049" data-end="1857.12">which is our you know that component</span> <span data-start="1857.12" data-end="1860.09">that loads in the the other WordPress</span> <span data-start="1860.09" data-end="1861.47">data and it's just a component that</span> <span data-start="1861.47" data-end="1863.179">we're loading from mpm and adding to the</span> <span data-start="1863.179" data-end="1865.309">project when you do that it shows up in</span> <span data-start="1865.309" data-end="1869.39">the palette okay so you know that wraps</span> <span data-start="1869.39" data-end="1871.58">it up I hope that's you know that you</span> <span data-start="1871.58" data-end="1873.169">can kind of appreciate you know the</span> <span data-start="1873.169" data-end="1875">significance of of what we've created</span> <span data-start="1875" data-end="1878.74">here we have a beta of the tool online</span> <span data-start="1878.74" data-end="1881.419">so you can visit this address or visit</span> <span data-start="1881.419" data-end="1884.48">montage to do calm and sign up for the</span> <span data-start="1884.48" data-end="1887">beta you'll get in right away and you</span> <span data-start="1887" data-end="1889.49">can build stuff with it the framework</span> <span data-start="1889.49" data-end="1892.01">itself is also available online montage</span> <span data-start="1892.01" data-end="1893.779">j/s is open source and it's on gay</span> <span data-start="1893.779" data-end="1895.309">hub so if you want to use the framework</span> <span data-start="1895.309" data-end="1896.929">stand alone without our tool you can do</span> <span data-start="1896.929" data-end="1898.369">that too and you can build your own</span> <span data-start="1898.369" data-end="1900.169">tools on top we would love to see people</span> <span data-start="1900.169" data-end="1903.349">build new stuff with it so we're going</span> <span data-start="1903.349" data-end="1905.389">to be here all week I'm here with two of</span> <span data-start="1905.389" data-end="1907.129">my colleagues or wearing montage studio</span> <span data-start="1907.129" data-end="1909.71">t-shirts so if you happen to build</span> <span data-start="1909.71" data-end="1911.57">something great with montage studio this</span> <span data-start="1911.57" data-end="1914.539">week you can track one of us down we'll</span> <span data-start="1914.539"
