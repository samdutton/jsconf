and you can define ways</span> <span data-start="690.65" data-end="694.13">that property access property generation</span> <span data-start="694.13" data-end="695.87">property setting all of that works</span> <span data-start="695.87" data-end="698.57">through through these meta methods so</span> <span data-start="698.57" data-end="701.03">table access meta methods we can look at</span> <span data-start="701.03" data-end="705.29">this oh great it's not going to show me</span> <span data-start="705.29" data-end="713.39">code again let's see so you can see</span> <span data-start="713.39" data-end="715.94">those get and set meta table so s1 is</span> <span data-start="715.94" data-end="719.75">basically our pseudo object and this is</span> <span data-start="719.75" data-end="722">how we control the the meta tables on</span> <span data-start="722" data-end="724.73">objects we have things like to string</span> <span data-start="724.73" data-end="727.88">which helps control how things are</span> <span data-start="727.88" data-end="729.59">coerced to strings when we want to print</span> <span data-start="729.59" data-end="733.85">them out and such we've also got index</span> <span data-start="733.85" data-end="736.85">and new index these control generation</span> <span data-start="736.85" data-end="739.61">or mist property accesses which is</span> <span data-start="739.61" data-end="741.44">really useful it allows you to basically</span> <span data-start="741.44" data-end="746.24">do method missing and do it very</span> <span data-start="746.24" data-end="748.4">flexibly so I'm not going to go too much</span> <span data-start="748.4" data-end="749.99">further into that again trying to keep</span> <span data-start="749.99" data-end="753.23">this somewhat short the next area that's</span> <span data-start="753.23" data-end="757.43">sort of interesting is how Lua does oo</span> <span data-start="757.43" data-end="759.02">programming it's very similar to</span> <span data-start="759.02" data-end="762.17">javascript in a way it's more prototype</span> <span data-start="762.17" data-end="764.75">based so we have these tables that are</span> <span data-start="764.75" data-end="766.64">just bags of properties now the cool</span> <span data-start="766.64" data-end="767.96">thing about these tables is</span> <span data-start="767.96" data-end="769.64">the keys can be anything more than just</span> <span data-start="769.64" data-end="771.44">strings so we can we can basically</span> <span data-start="771.44" data-end="775.37">create any sort of mapping between 11</span> <span data-start="775.37" data-end="777.41">set of access ER and another allows a</span> <span data-start="777.41" data-end="779.39">very rich way to create something that</span> <span data-start="779.39" data-end="781.4">looks like an object and then you can</span> <span data-start="781.4" data-end="785.42">give it better behavior by adding stuff</span> <span data-start="785.42" data-end="788.42">via the meta tables or basically</span> <span data-start="788.42" data-end="790.58">creating inheritance via the meta table</span> <span data-start="790.58" data-end="792.74">features so you can basically say look</span> <span data-start="792.74" data-end="794.66">things up in this object when you can't</span> <span data-start="794.66" data-end="797.42">find it here since this is totally user</span> <span data-start="797.42" data-end="799.64">programmable though people have come up</span> <span data-start="799.64" data-end="802.7">with all kinds of ways to program Lua on</span> <span data-start="802.7" data-end="807.23">there are many many ways to do the meta</span> <span data-start="807.23" data-end="809.18">table set up so people have emulated</span> <span data-start="809.18" data-end="811.85">class style inheritance systems they've</span> <span data-start="811.85" data-end="814.37">emulated purely prototype and different</span> <span data-start="814.37" data-end="816.23">differential inheritance based systems</span> <span data-start="816.23" data-end="818.99">as well as something more like self if</span> <span data-start="818.99" data-end="822.16">you're familiar so the the syntax that</span> <span data-start="822.16" data-end="824.36">that you should be aware of in this case</span> <span data-start="824.36" data-end="827.54">is this colon right here is is somewhat</span> <span data-start="827.54" data-end="831.25">like passing self as a implicit argument</span> <span data-start="831.25" data-end="835.01">to the function itself right here on if</span> <span data-start="835.01" data-end="837.44">we called it without and just did dot it</span> <span data-start="837.44" data-end="839.57">would expect that first argument to be</span> <span data-start="839.57" data-end="842.78">self so as we see we don't have to</span> <span data-start="842.78" data-end="844.79">declare and it's available here self</span> <span data-start="844.79" data-end="846.8">just if you guys are wondering is like</span> <span data-start="846.8" data-end="850.94">this in JavaScript so we can see we're</span> <span data-start="850.94" data-end="854.33">setting up an account here and basically</span> <span data-start="854.33" data-end="856.1">setting up the meda table kind of like a</span> <span data-start="856.1" data-end="859.49">constructor usually you wouldn't have to</span> <span data-start="859.49" data-end="861.65">implement new unless it's you know a</span> <span data-start="861.65" data-end="866.81">base class of your own system and then</span> <span data-start="866.81" data-end="870.56">account dot deposit you can see how a is</span> <span data-start="870.56" data-end="872.78">actually our account instance and</span> <span data-start="872.78" data-end="876.44">otherwise if we did colon a colon</span> <span data-start="876.44" data-end="879.14">deposit it would actually call the meta</span> <span data-start="879.14" data-end="882.98">table so that's that's the quick intro</span> <span data-start="882.98" data-end="885.59">the rough information here do you guys</span> <span data-start="885.59" data-end="888.4">have anything you want me to explore or</span> <span data-start="888.4" data-end="892.4">questions</span> <span data-start="892.41" data-end="895.24">yes Lou is actually probably one of the</span> <span data-start="895.24" data-end="899.769">easiest easiest languages to to work</span> <span data-start="899.769" data-end="902.649">with as far as she goes so it's not only</span> <span data-start="902.649" data-end="904.72">easy to write actual see extensions and</span> <span data-start="904.72" data-end="907.449">then embed it in other see environments</span> <span data-start="907.449" data-end="913.81">but there is a huge amount of community</span> <span data-start="913.81" data-end="915.73">out there that has contributed a lot of</span> <span data-start="915.73" data-end="917.589">libraries one of the things you'll</span> <span data-start="917.589" data-end="919.87">notice let me show you how to scroll</span> <span data-start="919.87" data-end="921.699">down here a little bit is the standard</span> <span data-start="921.699" data-end="924.399">library is actually very short and small</span> <span data-start="924.399" data-end="927.25">so we have basically you know a little</span> <span data-start="927.25" data-end="928.959">bit of math some table stuff string</span> <span data-start="928.959" data-end="931.81">stuff a few IO things and some OS things</span> <span data-start="931.81" data-end="933.519">so you can start and stop and exit your</span> <span data-start="933.519" data-end="937.06">process the reason it's so minimal is it</span> <span data-start="937.06" data-end="938.92">initially it was more so for embedding</span> <span data-start="938.92" data-end="940.48">in other programs that have their own</span> <span data-start="940.48" data-end="943.99">sort of domain to work with and here we</span> <span data-start="943.99" data-end="949.149">see that we need a lot more to do say</span> <span data-start="949.149" data-end="950.769">foreign function interface stuff so</span> <span data-start="950.769" data-end="952.449">people have provided those and you can</span> <span data-start="952.449" data-end="954.61">basically require them in dynamically at</span> <span data-start="954.61" data-end="957.16">runtime and that's been a very big</span> <span data-start="957.16" data-end="959.649">benefit to the Lua community but</span> <span data-start="959.649" data-end="962.019">unfortunately batteries are still not</span> <span data-start="962.019" data-end="964.269">included so you do have to go search</span> <span data-start="964.269" data-end="968.38">those out and install them how is</span> <span data-start="968.38" data-end="970.99">debugging when you embed it into web</span> <span data-start="970.99" data-end="974.26">pages insist oh it's it's not available</span> <span data-start="974.26" data-end="976.269">in web browsers web browsers haven't</span> <span data-start="976.269" data-end="978.97">implemented it people have worked on</span> <span data-start="978.97" data-end="982.69">some early Lua to JavaScript compilers</span> <span data-start="982.69" data-end="984.579">unfortunately since Lou is a little more</span> <span data-start="984.579" data-end="987.519">dynamic it's a little hard to do a very</span> <span data-start="987.519" data-end="990.94">literal translation to JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="990.94" data-end="994.449">it's it's more so of a serious vm plus</span> <span data-start="994.449" data-end="1002.07">whatever compiler you you're using</span> <span data-start="1002.08" data-end="1004.52">yeah so the meta table allows you to</span> <span data-start="1004.52" data-end="1005.99">take these objects and basically</span> <span data-start="1005.99" data-end="1008.24">intercept anything happening with them</span> <span data-start="1008.24" data-end="1012.08">in JavaScript obviously we don't have</span> <span data-start="1012.08" data-end="1014.33">catch all's so that's that's a big</span> <span data-start="1014.33" data-end="1017.39">problem wrong man proxy also a thing</span> <span data-start="1017.39" data-end="1020.45">that I run into very very quickly all</span> <span data-start="1020.45" data-end="1022.04">the time in my JavaScript code is when I</span> <span data-start="1022.04" data-end="1024.08">want to key an object off of something</span> <span data-start="1024.08" data-end="1026.15">other than a stream you have to generate</span> <span data-start="1026.15" data-end="1030.02">symbols to act in that place for you Lua</span> <span data-start="1030.02" data-end="1031.64">is nice enough to just allow you to use</span> <span

to server side JavaScript is</span> <span data-start="1059.27" data-end="1061.85">actually quite a good point they do have</span> <span data-start="1061.85" data-end="1064.28">bindings to lib eV and
