data-end="241.689">the actual problem was so func unit</span> <span data-start="241.689" data-end="243.909">features in browser or selenium based</span> <span data-start="243.909" data-end="245.889">testing you write the test once and it</span> <span data-start="245.889" data-end="247.75">runs in both places and it's a jquery</span> <span data-start="247.75" data-end="249.729">like syntax there's no setup involved it</span> <span data-start="249.729" data-end="252.879">just use this java in the browser it</span> <span data-start="252.879" data-end="254.889">provides accurate event simulation in</span> <span data-start="254.889" data-end="257.62">this new shiny ide so it's built on top</span> <span data-start="257.62"

data-end="265.509">accurately and finally were to the demo</span> <span data-start="265.509" data-end="269.49">so let's jump out and look at some code</span> <span data-start="269.49" data-end="273.639">we just pushed out a new version of the</span> <span data-start="273.639" data-end="276.009">func unit website so if you go there</span> <span data-start="276.009" data-end="283.26">there's a download</span> <span data-start="283.27" data-end="290.64">there's no mouse</span> <span data-start="290.65" data-end="292.3">so there's there's a download there and</span> <span data-start="292.3" data-end="294.28">you know I'm gonna set up mirroring real</span> <span data-start="294.28" data-end="295.449">quick so I can actually see what I'm</span> <span data-start="295.449" data-end="311.869">doing</span> <span data-start="311.879" data-end="317.02">okay</span> <span data-start="317.03" data-end="319.52">so if you go ahead and download the</span> <span data-start="319.52" data-end="320.99">framework I've already done that so we</span> <span data-start="320.99" data-end="323.09">can save some time it comes with a</span> <span data-start="323.09" data-end="326.21">couple folders I've got an app running</span> <span data-start="326.21" data-end="327.83">locally here that we're gonna write a</span> <span data-start="327.83" data-end="329.36">test for it's just a simple contact</span> <span data-start="329.36" data-end="331.55">management app and all you know there's</span> <span data-start="331.55" data-end="332.69">some functionality or if you click</span> <span data-start="332.69" data-end="334.39">really see that well but if you click a</span> <span data-start="334.39" data-end="336.62">category at the top it filters the</span> <span data-start="336.62" data-end="338.69">results and you can add new categories</span> <span data-start="338.69" data-end="342.2">through this little form here so we're</span> <span data-start="342.2" data-end="343.64">gonna just write a quick test at that</span> <span data-start="343.64" data-end="347.18">that form creation actually works so the</span> <span data-start="347.18" data-end="348.23">first thing you do when you download</span> <span data-start="348.23" data-end="349.82">funk unit is you can copy all these</span> <span data-start="349.82" data-end="351.71">files into a funk unit directory in your</span> <span data-start="351.71" data-end="354.53">application so I've got this funk unit</span> <span data-start="354.53" data-end="355.61">folder right here and I copied</span> <span data-start="355.61" data-end="357.14">everything in there comes with this</span> <span data-start="357.14" data-end="359.24">little demo app so if we open that up</span> <span data-start="359.24" data-end="361.55">and you're there it comes with in the</span> <span data-start="361.55" data-end="363.2">demo app there's your application page</span> <span data-start="363.2" data-end="365.51">right here and then a funk unit page so</span> <span data-start="365.51" data-end="366.8">if you open the funk unit page in your</span> <span data-start="366.8" data-end="371.78">browser so it's gonna do some typing and</span> <span data-start="371.78" data-end="373.64">some dragging and dropping and then what</span> <span data-start="373.64" data-end="375.44">actually happened was this page opened a</span> <span data-start="375.44" data-end="376.91">you know separate window it's your</span> <span data-start="376.91" data-end="378.62">application and then ran the test so</span> <span data-start="378.62" data-end="380.51">this is just cute it's just a it</span> <span data-start="380.51" data-end="382.43">is an API on top of cue unit so if you</span> <span data-start="382.43" data-end="384.169">seem qunit test before it works in a</span> <span data-start="384.169" data-end="387.71">similar way so we're gonna go ahead and</span> <span data-start="387.71" data-end="391.61">write a test for the for that</span> <span data-start="391.61" data-end="396.62">application that context application so</span> <span data-start="396.62" data-end="398.54">all we want to do in this application</span> <span data-start="398.54" data-end="400.94">it's for this test actually is click the</span> <span data-start="400.94" data-end="410.51">lips where'd that go</span> <span data-start="410.52" data-end="412.71">so we're gonna we're gonna write some</span> <span data-start="412.71" data-end="414.06">code that's going to click this cut this</span> <span data-start="414.06" data-end="415.919">create button here and then it's gonna</span> <span data-start="415.919" data-end="418.319">click inside of the the form that pops</span> <span data-start="418.319" data-end="420.449">up it's gonna hit backspace a few times</span> <span data-start="420.449" data-end="422.46">to clear out the what's what's showing</span> <span data-start="422.46" data-end="423.84">and then it's going to type something</span> <span data-start="423.84" data-end="427.47">like animal and then hit enter and then</span> <span data-start="427.47" data-end="429.8">verify that something actually showed up</span> <span data-start="429.8" data-end="433.56">so I've got a cheat sheet here but</span> <span data-start="433.56" data-end="434.55">basically well we'll write the</span> <span data-start="434.55" data-end="436.77">pseudocode first so all it's going to do</span> <span data-start="436.77" data-end="438.539">is we're gonna first open the right page</span> <span data-start="438.539" data-end="441.449">so s not open is the command that opens</span> <span data-start="441.449" data-end="443.25">the page we're two directories office so</span> <span data-start="443.25" data-end="446.69">it's going to go to contacts that HTML</span> <span data-start="446.69" data-end="450.03">and then we're going to grab that</span> <span data-start="450.03" data-end="455.34">contact that plus button there and we're</span> <span data-start="455.34" data-end="458.759">gonna click it we're gonna wait for the</span>
