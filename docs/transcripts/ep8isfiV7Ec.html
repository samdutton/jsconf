data-end="842.48">framework oh sorry I'm going to start</span> <span data-start="842.48" data-end="845.69">with reading code so I'm going to talk</span> <span data-start="845.69" data-end="847.49">about reading other frameworks and how I</span> <span data-start="847.49" data-end="849.08">think that's a good practice to learn</span> <span data-start="849.08" data-end="851.18">how to think in sort of framework level</span> <span data-start="851.18" data-end="854.66">terms then it's deciding what to pull up</span> <span data-start="854.66"

data-end="863.63">to pull into a framework and then I'll</span> <span data-start="863.63" data-end="866.21">talk about how that decision has to be</span> <span data-start="866.21" data-end="869.24">gone into with with intention and</span> <span data-start="869.24" data-end="870.86">knowing that you're making trade-offs</span> <span data-start="870.86" data-end="872.36">and
