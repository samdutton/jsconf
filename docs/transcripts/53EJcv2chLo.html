that</span> <span data-start="307.96" data-end="309.97">developers took to building out those</span> <span data-start="309.97" data-end="312.82">applications and we also took a look at</span> <span

<p><span data-start="315.37" data-end="318.16">UX frameworks that are out there so I'm</span> <span data-start="318.16" data-end="320.47">thinking of people here like ionic or</span> <span

data-end="326.2">world of a reacts of the worlds but the</span> <span data-start="326.2" data-end="328.03">people that are making UX controls</span> <span data-start="328.03" data-end="330.61">because those are the things that end up</span> <span data-start="330.61" data-end="333.01">driving user interaction and we said you</span> <span data-start="333.01" data-end="334.51">know what is there any difference</span> <span data-start="334.51" data-end="336.58">between the way that average Joe</span> <span data-start="336.58" data-end="338.38">developer is building things today</span> <span data-start="338.38" data-end="340.87">versus the way that these people who are</span> <span data-start="340.87" data-end="343.18">creating the best-of-breed UX frameworks</span> <span data-start="343.18" data-end="344.47">are actually thinking about performance</span> <span data-start="344.47" data-end="346.99">and where there are differences between</span> <span

data-end="353.47">does that make sense</span> <span data-start="353.47" data-end="357.97">yeah and so from that we identified six</span> <span data-start="357.97" data-end="361.63">issues by the way the all of the tests</span> <span data-start="361.63" data-end="363.13">that we performed here because you need</span> <span data-start="363.13" data-end="365.8">to control four devices here we used</span> <span data-start="365.8" data-end="369.58">three kind of you know recent but not</span> <span data-start="369.58" data-end="372.07">too recent devices because we wanted to</span> <span
