<p><span data-start="113.759" data-end="116.31">CSS is hard oh yeah I think that's what</span> <span data-start="116.31" data-end="118.38">the talks were about yesterday yeah yeah</span> <span data-start="118.38" data-end="120.06">so rather than do a modal you can just</span> <span data-start="120.06" data-end="123.03">do this yeah so you want to you want to</span> <span data-start="123.03" data-end="125.399">get rid of that so you can try to do is</span> <span data-start="125.399" data-end="126.899">or what you want to do is make it so</span> <span data-start="126.899" data-end="128.34">that it sends that to the console output</span> <span data-start="128.34" data-end="131.35">instead all right</span> <span data-start="131.35" data-end="134.02">so you want it to be like I said you</span> <span data-start="134.02" data-end="136.3">want to use wah console that woke him up</span> <span data-start="136.3" data-end="137.74">that work yeah it's close enough</span>

well it's your turn to talk now</span> <span data-start="150.64" data-end="152.68">okay we're on to the next slide is that</span> <span data-start="152.68" data-end="154.87">how this works yeah okay all right so</span> <span data-start="154.87" data-end="156.76">one of your options for removing window</span> <span data-start="156.76" data-end="159.64">dot alert is to use this thing said so</span> <span data-start="159.64" data-end="161.53">you can just replace all of the things</span> <span data-start="161.53" data-end="163.36">in here right problem solved right first</span> <span data-start="163.36" data-end="168.04">well not so much hi cuz you know you</span> <span data-start="168.04" data-end="170.44">might end up replacing a bunch of stuff</span> <span data-start="170.44" data-end="172.33">that you didn't want to replace because</span> <span data-start="172.33" data-end="174.61">you might end up just like you know when</span> <span data-start="174.61" data-end="175.75">you do a global search and replace you</span> <span data-start="175.75" data-end="177.19">do a global search and replace maybe you</span> <span data-start="177.19" data-end="178.93">actually wanted that to still say that</span> <span data-start="178.93" data-end="181.33">it was still window alert even though</span> <span data-start="181.33" data-end="183.31">you're using console dot log so how</span> <span data-start="183.31" data-end="186.22">would you deal with that Brian well we</span> <span data-start="186.22" data-end="188.5">can use this cool module called falafel</span> <span data-start="188.5" data-end="191.95">that builds up in AST and like parses</span> <span data-start="191.95" data-end="193.84">the javascript so we know that this is</span> <span data-start="193.84" data-end="196.36">not a string window alert this is like</span> <span data-start="196.36" data-end="198.22">legit windowed on alert and you'll note</span> <span data-start="198.22" data-end="199.9">you have to you have to take care when</span> <span data-start="199.9" data-end="201.42">you're doing this and these are all</span> <span data-start="201.42" data-end="204.76">highly endorsed will never get you in</span> <span data-start="204.76" data-end="207.28">trouble methods for making sure that</span> <span data-start="207.28" data-end="208.48">you're running the right thing to make</span> <span data-start="208.48" data-end="210.61">sure that you only call your monkey</span> <span data-start="210.61" data-end="212.82">patch method when it's appropriate right</span> <span data-start="212.82" data-end="215.26">so it's still not that great though</span> <span data-start="215.26" data-end="217.81">because let's say you wrote code like</span> <span data-start="217.81" data-end="220.81">this because you're smart and you want</span> <span data-start="220.81" data-end="224.82">to access alert in the smart better way</span> <span data-start="224.82" data-end="227.86">dynamic languages are very dynamic yeah</span> <span data-start="227.86" data-end="229.87">so you can call things in all sorts of</span> <span data-start="229.87" data-end="233.32">ways so that won't work but what if we</span> <span data-start="233.32" data-end="235.9">were like super smart and used a JSP are</span> <span data-start="235.9" data-end="237.46">sir even more so we wrote a code</span> <span data-start="237.46" data-end="240.01">transform that took input like that and</span> <span data-start="240.01" data-end="242.8">maybe did output like this so like on</span> <span data-start="242.8" data-end="244.93">every function call we make sure that</span> <span data-start="244.93" data-end="246.81">the thing that we're not calling is</span> <span data-start="246.81" data-end="250.12">window dot alert right so this is</span> <span data-start="250.12" data-end="251.95">actually basically the same code it's</span> <span data-start="251.95" data-end="253.87">super simple alright just drop that in</span> <span data-start="253.87" data-end="256.27">your app and no more window alerts no</span> <span data-start="256.27" data-end="258.73">big deal I sweet there's one small</span> <span data-start="258.73" data-end="263.47">problem with that though you've actually</span> <span data-start="263.47" data-end="265.35">managed to</span> <span data-start="265.35" data-end="268.17">completely complicate your build process</span> <span data-start="268.17" data-end="270.37">because you have to do this source to</span> <span data-start="270.37" data-end="273.04">source transform you like if you want to</span> <span data-start="273.04" data-end="274.6">be able to debug this in the browser</span> <span data-start="274.6" data-end="276.22">because you can't do this at all no</span> <span data-start="276.22" data-end="277.39">really you're going to need to generate</span> <span data-start="277.39" data-end="278.62">source maps which is yet another</span> <span data-start="278.62" data-end="280.51">complication for your build process and</span> <span data-start="280.51" data-end="282.28">we have literally duplicated the number</span> <span data-start="282.28" data-end="283.69">of function calls that you're doing so</span> <span data-start="283.69" data-end="285.79">we've taken something that was probably</span> <span data-start="285.79" data-end="287.56">reasonably perform it and we've made it</span> <span data-start="287.56" data-end="288.94">while performance isn't really an issue</span> <span data-start="288.94" data-end="290.5">in node ever so that's not right you</span> <span data-start="290.5" data-end="292.63">like by Morgan Peter's right its web</span> <span data-start="292.63" data-end="295.12">scale yeah it's not horizontally no</span> <span data-start="295.12" data-end="301.15">problem two desktops you're set oh yeah</span> <span data-start="301.15" data-end="303.25">there's also this other problem which is</span> <span data-start="303.25" data-end="305.35">that you know you might end up breaking</span> <span data-start="305.35" data-end="307.66">everybody else's code and so either you</span> <span data-start="307.66" data-end="309.31">have to like maintain your own Fork of</span> <span data-start="309.31" data-end="311.35">the stuff that has your like preciously</span> <span data-start="311.35" data-end="313.95">built arc is newly created like</span> <span data-start="313.95" data-end="317.02">transformed version but or you might</span> <span data-start="317.02" data-end="318.46">want to lose through some sort of</span> <span data-start="318.46" data-end="320.38">dynamic process where it goes and it</span> <span data-start="320.38" data-end="321.55">monkey patches your code at runtime</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="321.55" data-end="323.02">Bryce wouldn't know anything about that</span> <span data-start="323.02" data-end="325.75">and like there's nothing that can go</span> <span data-start="325.75" data-end="327.43">wrong with that and there are no like</span> <span data-start="327.43" data-end="329.53">performance implications that always on</span> <span data-start="329.53" data-end="331.3">the forest you didn't it okay what will</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="331.3" data-end="333.31">I said you're selling them on it this is</span> <span data-start="333.31" data-end="335.26">yeah yeah this is great okay everyone</span> <span data-start="335.26" data-end="338.77">looks convinced okay so like a better</span> <span data-start="338.77" data-end="340.99">solution maybe would be just to do this</span> <span data-start="340.99" data-end="343.21">like window dot alert equals console dot</span> <span data-start="343.21" data-end="344.68">log fine call this is monkey patching</span> <span data-start="344.68" data-end="348.07">classic here right so done deal like no</span> <span data-start="348.07" data-end="350.8">more alerts in your app and kind of as</span> <span data-start="350.8" data-end="353.2">an added bonus monkey patching is really</span> <span data-start="353.2" data-end="355.57">funny and just like imagine the look on</span> <span data-start="355.57" data-end="357.37">the next person who has to maintain this</span> <span data-start="357.37" data-end="360.16">code space when they see what you did</span> <span data-start="360.16" data-end="362.05">yeah that's the thing about monkey</span> <span data-start="362.05" data-end="363.729">patching right it makes people kind of</span> <span data-start="363.729" data-end="366.04">mad and that's kind of awesome so like</span> <span data-start="366.04" data-end="367.69">that's a good reason to use it right</span> <span data-start="367.69" data-end="371.65">there all right cool so that's great but</span> <span data-start="371.65" data-end="374.11">what if we add some cool jQuery widget</span> <span data-start="374.11" data-end="376">onto our page that for some reason needs</span> <span data-start="376" data-end="379">window dot alert for god knows why he</span> <span data-start="379" data-end="380.77">used it to block maybe I don't know it's</span> <span data-start="380.77" data-end="385.96">a control flow techniques right so we we</span> <span data-start="385.96" data-end="387.85">want to maybe just monkey patch a</span> <span data-start="387.85" data-end="389.26">specific part of our app so some</span> <span data-start="389.26" data-end="391.71">specific context so what you might do is</span> <span data-start="391.71" data-end="393.76">grab a reference to endure that alert</span> <span data-start="393.76" data-end="395.74">replace it with console that log do your</span> <span data-start="395.74" data-end="396.5">thing and</span> <span data-start="396.5" data-end="400.39">and on replace it right yeah so that's</span> <span data-start="400.39" data-end="403.22">cool and maybe you want to write a cool</span> <span data-start="403.22" data-end="404.78">helper like this because we're</span> <span data-start="404.78" data-end="407.69">functional programmers and take the</span> <span data-start="407.69" data-end="409.46">function returns a function yeah so this</span> <span data-start="409.46" data-end="411.02">is another kind of classic monkey</span> <span data-start="411.02" data-end="413.24">patching thing that you might do like</span> <span data-start="413.24" data-end="414.65">function not apply and functional</span> <span data-start="414.65" data-end="417.32">collaery best friends and you can just</span> <span data-start="417.32" data-end="418.58">kind of sneak additional behavior in</span> <span data-start="418.58" data-end="422">there yeah that's great there's nothing</span> <span data-start="422" data-end="425.72">wrong about oh god async behavior so you</span> <span data-start="425.72" data-end="428.33">run this code here and it's going to</span> <span data-start="428.33" data-end="430.28">totally run without your monkey patching</span> <span data-start="430.28" data-end="432.97">because you did something asynchronous</span> <span data-start="432.97" data-end="435.2">right if only there was some way to fix</span> <span data-start="435.2" data-end="439.19">this behavior oh but wait there is you</span> <span data-start="439.19" data-end="440.84">just among needs a monkey patch that</span> <span data-start="440.84" data-end="444.53">timeout problem solved see you got the</span> <span data-start="444.53" data-end="446.69">same we basically do the same thing we</span> <span data-start="446.69" data-end="448.13">did before only we apply this to</span> <span data-start="448.13" data-end="450.86">window.settimeout now so now you've got</span> <span data-start="450.86" data-end="452.75">your patch run your original function</span> <span data-start="452.75" data-end="455.66">and then unpatch it sweet right also no</span> <span data-start="455.66" data-end="457.1">only done note the use of the comma</span> <span data-start="457.1" data-end="458.54">operator in this code sample that's</span> <span data-start="458.54" data-end="462.65">because I wrote this slide okay but what</span> <span data-start="462.65" data-end="464.57">about set interval like our app doesn't</span> <span data-start="464.57" data-end="467.12">do just that one async thing sure monkey</span> <span data-start="467.12" data-end="469.49">patch that interval keep going all right</span> <span data-start="469.49" data-end="471.74">cool but like there are other AP eyes to</span> <span data-start="471.74" data-end="474.59">what about those monkey patch everything</span> <span data-start="474.59" data-end="476.71">just monkey patch the entire universe</span> <span data-start="476.71" data-end="480.86">really is that okay yeah that's totally</span> <span data-start="480.86" data-end="487.07">okay ok cool so actually this is what</span> <span data-start="487.07" data-end="488.66">for us and I have each independently</span> <span data-start="488.66" data-end="490.28">done in different contexts I wrote this</span> <span data-start="490.28" data-end="492.35">thing called zone jas which gives you an</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="492.35" data-end="494.27">API that looks like this that says</span> <span data-start="494.27" data-end="496.58">monkey patch everything all the time and</span> <span data-start="496.58" data-end="498.86">unlucky patch it outside of this context</span> <span data-start="498.86" data-end="501.89">so you could accomplish the same as we</span> <span data-start="501.89" data-end="503.63">were showing in the previous slides with</span> <span data-start="503.63" data-end="504.74">a little code snippet that looks like</span> <span data-start="504.74" data-end="506.87">this and you didn't even have to monkey</span> <span data-start="506.87" data-end="508.94">patch literally every single a sync API</span> <span data-start="508.94" data-end="511.4">in the browser so that's a little bit</span> <span data-start="511.4" data-end="512.39">less work than it would have been</span> <span data-start="512.39" data-end="516.05">otherwise

stuff's</span> <span data-start="539.56" data-end="540.73">already happened by the time you get</span> <span data-start="540.73" data-end="542.8">here and you could have set that session</span> <span data-start="542.8" data-end="545.56">anywhere and it scoped this particular</span> <span data-start="545.56" data-end="547.3">continuation change so for each</span> <span data-start="547.3" data-end="549.61">individual requests that you have coming</span> <span data-start="549.61" data-end="551.65">in we'd added this behavior the</span> <span data-start="551.65" data-end="553.75">interesting thing about this is that the</span> <span data-start="553.75" data-end="555.88">consequences are not nearly as dire as</span> <span data-start="555.88" data-end="558.34">you might think they are like depending</span> <span data-start="558.34" data-end="561.19">on what's going on you may see about 0.5</span> <span data-start="561.19" data-end="564.22">percent to about well okay like in</span> <span data-start="564.22" data-end="565.72">pathological conditions it's like</span> <span data-start="565.72" data-end="568.12">ninety-five percent overhead and like</span> <span data-start="568.12" data-end="571.84">the memory overhead is like 18 times as</span> <span data-start="571.84" data-end="572.95">much and that's all gross but that</span> <span data-start="572.95" data-end="574.06">actually doesn't happen because that's</span> <span data-start="574.06" data-end="575.92">not in code that people actually right</span> <span data-start="575.92" data-end="578.26">that's purely micro benchmark code so</span> <span data-start="578.26" data-end="579.97">that's your pathological case so you get</span> <span data-start="579.97" data-end="582.22">all this interesting async behavior that</span> <span data-start="582.22" data-end="584.23">is done by basically overriding</span> <span data-start="584.23" data-end="586.69">literally every acing function in note</span> <span data-start="586.69" data-end="588.97">right and you only have to buy 18 more</span> <span data-start="588.97" data-end="591.31">computers to do it yeah and to the best</span> <span data-start="591.31" data-end="592.75">of my knowledge this I'll just work</span> <span data-start="592.75" data-end="597.19">in I ojs as well so that's great that's</span> <span data-start="597.19" data-end="600.28">cool okay so you know yeah so this is</span> <span data-start="600.28" data-end="602.2">the key this is the Cardinal law this</span> <span data-start="602.2" data-end="604.33">stuff is super fun everybody should do</span> <span data-start="604.33" data-end="606.22">it in all of your libraries from out

data-start="610.54" data-end="612.34">more of this into happy going for it you</span> <span data-start="612.34" data-end="613.81">can totally solve all your domains</span> <span data-start="613.81"

everything but don't break things for other people and the thing</span> <span data-start="621.46" data-end="623.89">about this is that i have done this</span> <span data-start="623.89" data-end="626.17">there are literally thousands of</span> <span data-start="626.17" data-end="628.57">production sites running an entirely</span> <span data-start="628.57" data-end="630.16">monkey patched environment because</span> <span data-start="630.16" data-end="631.63">that's how the New Relic monitoring</span> <span data-start="631.63" data-end="635.65">agent works but you and almost nothing</span> <span data-start="635.65" data-end="637.39">has gone wrong but when it has gone</span> <span data-start="637.39" data-end="639.25">wrong it has been bad because somebody</span> <span data-start="639.25" data-end="640.72">else has monkey patched something that I</span> <span data-start="640.72" data-end="643.15">need the monkey patch in an incompatible</span> <span data-start="643.15" data-end="644.92">way and everything blows up and you</span> <span data-start="644.92" data-end="646.21">can't use those things together and</span> <span data-start="646.21" data-end="648.28">everybody is sad and it's just you know</span> <span data-start="648.28" data-end="649.96">do I great for a sad is the short</span> <span data-start="649.96" data-end="652.15">version no don't that's that's that's</span> <span data-start="652.15" data-end="655.39">bad okay so here's kind of a rundown</span> <span data-start="655.39" data-end="657.19">yeah a little bit of this earlier but</span> <span data-start="657.19" data-end="659.08">you should probably call the original</span> <span data-start="659.08" data-end="660.88">function that's important because if</span> <span data-start="660.88" data-end="662.95">some other monkey patch person</span> <span data-start="662.95" data-end="664.51">in there and must render the internals</span> <span data-start="664.51" data-end="667">of your environment you want to be able</span> <span data-start="667" data-end="668.35">to apply their behavior as well</span> <span data-start="668.35" data-end="669.7">otherwise you might not clean things up</span> <span data-start="669.7" data-end="671.71">correctly you should keep the original</span> <span data-start="671.71" data-end="674.02">context so the value of this you want it</span> <span data-start="674.02" data-end="675.34">to be the same as if someone called the</span> <span data-start="675.34" data-end="677.92">original function you should pass in all</span> <span data-start="677.92" data-end="680.02">the arguments not just you know whatever</span> <span data-start="680.02" data-end="682.42">the function signature looks like very</span> <span data-start="682.42" data-end="684.07">important bunch of signatures change</span> <span data-start="684.07" data-end="685.93">yeah you can't rely on anything</span> </p>

data-end="746.56">all i can remembers will be loyal scouts</span> <span data-start="746.56" data-end="749.05">yeah and then don't start forest fires</span> <span data-start="749.05" data-end="750.97">yeah i thought that was thought good to</span> <span data-start="750.97" data-end="752.77">you I like always be prepared but I</span> <span data-start="752.77" data-end="754.06">think that's the communist youth</span> <span data-start="754.06" data-end="756.64">tomorrow so whatever okay and the last</span> <span data-start="756.64" data-end="758.88">thing is you should test your code</span> <span data-start="758.88" data-end="761.86">because like that's a good way to deal</span> <span data-start="761.86" data-end="762.91">with hater so when people look at your</span> <span data-start="762.91" data-end="763.93">crazy thing and they're like there's no</span> <span data-start="763.93" data-end="765.52">way this will work you'd be like boy</span> <span data-start="765.52" data-end="767.26">have I got a surprise for you and you</span> <span data-start="767.26" data-end="769.33">show them your test cases and they're</span> <span data-start="769.33" data-end="771.55">all green and they're like well you know</span> <span data-start="771.55" data-end="773.91">you wrote crappy code but it works and</span> <span data-start="773.91" data-end="777.01">you should try and run your tests or</span> <span data-start="777.01" data-end="779.4">your your patch your monkey patch code</span> <span data-start="779.4" data-end="782.41">against lots of other people's code and</span> <span data-start="782.41" data-end="785.02">so I actually built something called the</span> <span data-start="785.02" data-end="786.7">intermediately sized Hadron Collider</span> <span data-start="786.7" data-end="789.07">that automatically does this for you so</span> <span data-start="789.07" data-end="790.96">the Large Hadron Collider is a particle</span> <span data-start="790.96" data-end="792.55">accelerator I'm not smart enough to make</span> <span data-start="792.55" data-end="794.62">that so I took the lesson dishes route</span> <span data-start="794.62" data-end="796.259">which is right a testing tool</span> <span data-start="796.259" data-end="798.959">but with what this does is like you give</span> <span data-start="798.959" data-end="801.119">it some patch and it'll run it against</span> <span data-start="801.119" data-end="803.549">like really commonly use libraries and</span> <span data-start="803.549" data-end="805.079">make sure that their test cases pass</span> <span data-start="805.079" data-end="807.809">even in a monkey patch environment so</span> <span data-start="807.809" data-end="809.339">you can have some level of confidence</span> <span data-start="809.339" data-end="811.499">that this works so it's kind of like a</span> <span data-start="811.499" data-end="814.109">like poor man's integration test from</span> <span data-start="814.109" data-end="815.939">reading monkey patch code so you can</span> <span data-start="815.939" data-end="819.929">check it out it's on github so kind of</span> <span data-start="819.929" data-end="821.459">in summary like right terrible code</span> <span data-start="821.459" data-end="823.649">prove that it works like laughs in the</span> <span data-start="823.649" data-end="828.159">face of your haters it's pretty good oh</span> <span data-start="828.169" data-end="831.199">and then yeah we have a slide on this</span> <span data-start="831.199" data-end="835.499">right for us this is your forte yeah you</span> <span data-start="835.499" data-end="839.279">know yeah welcome I'm not gonna dance</span> <span data-start="839.279" data-end="841.559">for you guys I'm really sorry it's not</span> <span data-start="841.559" data-end="844.41">really my thing but there's actually</span> <span data-start="844.41" data-end="845.939">actually I think we need to move on to</span> <span data-start="845.939" data-end="848.339">the next slide okay well i can say some</span> <span data-start="848.339" data-end="850.229">abstract philosophical things okay right</span> <span data-start="850.229" data-end="851.519">so like usually when you want to make</span> <span data-start="851.519" data-end="852.839">new behavior the way that you do it is</span> <span data-start="852.839" data-end="854.879">you like extend some existing class or</span> <span data-start="854.879" data-end="857.699">like write a new API but the cool thing</span> <span data-start="857.699" data-end="858.869">about this is that you don't have to</span> <span data-start="858.869" data-end="861.149">touch any of the existing code like you</span> <span data-start="861.149" data-end="862.47">can just introduce new behavior all over</span> <span data-start="862.47" data-end="864.449">the place and that's kind of powerful</span> <span data-start="864.449" data-end="867.839">like you see for instance polyfills or</span> <span data-start="867.839" data-end="870.269">even prolly fills how many people here</span> <span data-start="870.269" data-end="872.669">know what a prolly filler is okay all</span> <span data-start="872.669" data-end="875.189">right okay yeah so ask your neighbor or</span> <span data-start="875.189" data-end="876.359">just listen to me because I'm gonna</span> <span data-start="876.359" data-end="879.569">explain right now the idea is like when</span> <span data-start="879.569" data-end="881.369">when you're trying to come up with a new</span> <span data-start="881.369" data-end="883.529">feature for JavaScript or for the</span> <span data-start="883.529" data-end="885.869">browser like you try and implement it in</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="885.869" data-end="887.85">JavaScript inside of the current</span> <span data-start="887.85" data-end="890.129">environment and then you can use this as</span> <span data-start="890.129" data-end="891.989">a way to try and you know figure out if</span> <span data-start="891.989" data-end="894.839">the API is good or not so there are lots</span> <span data-start="894.839" data-end="896.16">of examples of this and actually can</span> <span data-start="896.16" data-end="898.47">kind of think of zones or continuation</span> <span data-start="898.47" data-end="901.22">local storage is probably fills yeah the</span> <span data-start="901.22" data-end="903.179">kind of go back to what I was saying at</span> <span data-start="903.179" data-end="905.579">the beginning of the talk the cool thing</span> <span data-start="905.579" data-end="908.039">is you can extend the properties of your</span> <span data-start="908.039" data-end="911.339">platform for all the people using it</span> <span data-start="911.339" data-end="913.139">without actually forcing them to write</span> <span data-start="913.139" data-end="914.609">any additional code that's the real</span> <span data-start="914.609" data-end="917.519">power of monkey patching is that you can</span> <span data-start="917.519" data-end="919.439">add new capabilities remove existing</span> <span data-start="919.439" data-end="924.179">capabilities alter all kinds of crazy</span> <span data-start="924.179" data-end="926.159">stuff for a particular runtime</span> <span data-start="926.159" data-end="928.289">environment without requiring people to</span> <span data-start="928.289" data-end="930.12">actually opt into your API sore</span> <span data-start="930.12" data-end="932.22">even necessarily to learn anything like</span> <span data-start="932.22" data-end="934.5">the you know an example is that with the</span> <span data-start="934.5" data-end="936.45">new relic agent you just require this</span> <span data-start="936.45" data-end="937.95">thing you don't even need to assign that</span> <span data-start="937.95" data-end="940.2">to a variable and all of a sudden you've</span> <span data-start="940.2" data-end="941.58">got performance metrics coming out of</span> <span data-start="941.58" data-end="944.25">your appt you know in with in the case</span> <span data-start="944.25" data-end="946.23">of zones it's used by angular to handle</span> <span data-start="946.23" data-end="948.029">a lot of their their kind of magical</span> <span data-start="948.029" data-end="949.62">scoping and data binding behavior</span> <span data-start="949.62" data-end="951.54">someday someday it'll do that right now</span> <span data-start="951.54" data-end="954.15">it just sits up on github sweet someday</span> <span data-start="954.15" data-end="956.76">yeah wait there's one other cool thing I</span> <span data-start="956.76" data-end="959.76">was going to say what was it okay we're</span> <span data-start="959.76" data-end="962.07">going on the next time we rehearse this</span> <span data-start="962.07" data-end="964.71">a lot yeah well I mean we did yeah this</span> <span data-start="964.71" data-end="966.39">is kind of like that time one of my</span> <span data-start="966.39" data-end="969.66">favorite people in computers said time</span> <span data-start="969.66" data-end="973.89">monkey patches all things yes really I</span> <span data-start="973.89" data-end="976.38">don't know what that means yeah but</span> <span data-start="976.38" data-end="978.24">really we're all changing like we're all</span> <span data-start="978.24" data-end="979.95">interacting with each other as time</span> <span data-start="979.95" data-end="982.89">passes and we're all changing aspects of</span> <span data-start="982.89" data-end="985.11">each other as time passes in this this</span> <span data-start="985.11" data-end="987.21">very mysterious and hard to observe way</span> <span data-start="987.21" data-end="989.43">so really over time we're all being</span> <span data-start="989.43" data-end="995.07">monkey patched by each other right that</span> <span data-start="995.07" data-end="997.8">was really good thanks I want to point</span> <span data-start="997.8" data-end="1000.529">out by absolute favorite thing about no</span> <span data-start="1000.529" data-end="1002.36">continuation local storage is its name</span> <span data-start="1002.36" data-end="1004.7">because its name is super concise and</span> <span data-start="1004.7" data-end="1006.38">easy to type every time I need to</span> <span data-start="1006.38"

data-end="1022.27">tell you what it does but it's long</span> <span data-start="1022.27" data-end="1025.5">right okay so</span> <span data-start="1025.5" data-end="1028.78">there's also some cool things on github</span> <span data-start="1028.78" data-end="1031">that show how you can use monkey</span> <span data-start="1031" data-end="1034.209">patching to crazyville things or crazy</span>
