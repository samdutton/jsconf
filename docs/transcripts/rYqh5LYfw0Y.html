data-end="617.72">important part are blue a further down</span> <span data-start="617.72" data-end="620.12">we can start from the root so when the</span> <span data-start="620.12" data-end="622.519">root this is the root node and represent</span> <span data-start="622.519" data-end="623.809">the starting point of your application</span> <span data-start="623.809" data-end="627.019">yeah then we can go deep and you know</span> <span data-start="627.019" data-end="629.72">see the first part and the first part in</span> <span data-start="629.72" data-end="632.179">fact it's on line 20 of our application</span> <span data-start="632.179" data-end="634.579">basic dodge is whatever it is and it's</span> <span data-start="634.579" data-end="638.149">alcohol to server dot listen our server</span> <span data-start="638.149" data-end="641.87">is starting to listen on stuff still</span> <span data-start="641.87"

data-end="649.399">so the next part it's this big block</span> <span data-start="649.399" data-end="651.259">here which is a bunch of and network</span> <span data-start="651.259" data-end="653.48">activity which is you can see it in in</span> <span data-start="653.48" data-end="655.67">green and this bunch of network activity</span> <span data-start="655.67" data-end="657.679">it's there's some bunch of antifreeze</span> <span data-start="657.679" data-end="661.399">these are not core stuff but then we</span> <span data-start="661.399" data-end="663.079">have a bunch of another node core stuff</span> <span data-start="663.079" data-end="665.209">which come from how we receive a TCP</span> <span data-start="665.209" data-end="668.179">connection in node.js itself so you know</span> <span data-start="668.179" data-end="669.559">that you are receiving a TCP connection</span> <span data-start="669.559"

data-end="678.679">being open after this you after this you</span> <span data-start="678.679" data-end="680.259">actually the key part of our application</span> <span data-start="680.259" data-end="682.92">which is our</span> <span data-start="682.92" data-end="687.18">set time out now you know you see that</span> <span data-start="687.18" data-end="688.95">is a set time out happening here and you</span> <span data-start="688.95" data-end="691.86">see a fork and you can ask wise is there</span> <span data-start="691.86" data-end="693.39">a fork now you can see two things first</span> <span data-start="693.39" data-end="695.04">of all the execution continued on the</span> <span data-start="695.04" data-end="696.93">left because there's a big Harrow that</span> <span data-start="696.93" data-end="698.339">will give you a hint that the execution</span> <span data-start="698.339" data-end="700.56">continued on the left but our execution</span> <span data-start="700.56" data-end="703.56">force white force well on the right you</span> <span data-start="703.56" data-end="706.2">can see that you know it start a set</span> <span data-start="706.2" data-end="711.209">timeout okay on the right but then on on</span> <span data-start="711.209" data-end="717.209">the left its when it's our promise dot</span> <span data-start="717.209" data-end="721.86">then okay which the resolution of the</span> <span data-start="721.86" data-end="726.36">promise itself so it it is and there is</span> <span data-start="726.36" data-end="728.1">a tiny bit of thing in the middle of</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="728.1" data-end="730.529">North core bits and bobs where things</span> <span data-start="730.529" data-end="734.16">are you know executed so so you know</span> <span data-start="734.16" data-end="736.98">these things is clear enough and we have</span> <span data-start="736.98" data-end="738.72">a bunch of stuff that not core does when</span> <span data-start="738.72" data-end="741.42">it finishes and you know it's for</span> <span data-start="741.42" data-end="743.75">example in here we are calling a</span> <span data-start="743.75" data-end="746.579">responsible end which is where we send</span> <span data-start="746.579" data-end="749.1">our response back to the user so we were</span> <span data-start="749.1" data-end="751.14">talking this okay no these I understand</span> <span data-start="751.14" data-end="752.88">is this is matching which matches my</span> <span data-start="752.88" data-end="753.87">understanding</span> <span data-start="753.87" data-end="756.079">now let's pile things up a little bit</span> <span data-start="756.079" data-end="759.3">now let's do a little quick refactoring</span> <span data-start="759.3" data-end="761.94">on this system and well if you are</span> <span data-start="761.94" data-end="763.26">following there is the full name of this</span> <span data-start="763.26" data-end="765.089">thing the generator one let's switch to</span> <span data-start="765.089" data-end="767.459">the sink oh wait when I think about</span> <span data-start="767.459" data-end="770.55">version this is function is that</span> <span data-start="770.55" data-end="772.649">function J functionally equivalent to</span> <span data-start="772.649" data-end="774.6">the previous one note that we are using</span> <span data-start="774.6" data-end="777.63">dot catch always put a dot catch when</span> <span data-start="777.63" data-end="778.529">you're doing these type of things</span> <span data-start="778.529" data-end="781.32">because otherwise you will leak file</span> <span data-start="781.32" data-end="783.45">descriptor and you know make popcorn of</span> <span data-start="783.45" data-end="786.839">your servers so I don't do that</span> <span data-start="786.839" data-end="788.73">put a catch here and when you're calling</span> <span data-start="788.73" data-end="793.529">promises so you need you know we are</span> <span data-start="793.529" data-end="796.05">doing this so let's try let's see if</span> <span data-start="796.05" data-end="798.74">it's the same as before</span> <span data-start="798.74" data-end="802.68">how many people think is the same how</span> <span data-start="802.68" data-end="805.74">many people 60s there different somebody</span> <span data-start="805.74" data-end="807.73">knows</span> <span data-start="807.73" data-end="816.709">somebody knows so this is this is that's</span> <span data-start="816.709" data-end="819.35">my zoom in okay so you can see that this</span> <span data-start="819.35" data-end="820.79">is actually different from the previous</span> <span data-start="820.79" data-end="824.81">one you generate a different diagram why</span> <span data-start="824.81" data-end="826.91">well first of all we can note that we</span> <span data-start="826.91" data-end="828.2">are actually using more synchronous</span> <span data-start="828.2" data-end="829.01">resources</span> <span data-start="829.01" data-end="831.14">note that promises are a synchronous</span> <span data-start="831.14" data-end="832.93">resources because they are scheduled in</span> <span data-start="832.93" data-end="834.769">they're going to be a synchronous</span> <span data-start="834.769" data-end="837.68">activity happening in the future so you</span> <span data-start="837.68" data-end="839.63">see that we are scheduling 2000 more</span> <span data-start="839.63" data-end="842.18">promises more or less than before why is</span> <span data-start="842.18" data-end="842.69">that</span> <span data-start="842.69" data-end="844.97">and the reason comes in the way the a</span> <span data-start="844.97" data-end="847.459">sink await I think a way to specified</span> <span data-start="847.459" data-end="849.62">and you know for every way that you do</span> <span data-start="849.62" data-end="851.3">you are locate a bunch of promises that</span> <span data-start="851.3" data-end="853.61">are not necessarily needed and they're</span> <span data-start="853.61" data-end="855.41">going to be removed and you know fixed</span> <span data-start="855.41" data-end="857.6">in later version of the spec I can send</span> <span data-start="857.6" data-end="859.579">you some links if you are interested so</span> <span data-start="859.579" data-end="861.44">the Reedy and you can see the difference</span> <span data-start="861.44" data-end="863.3">here that you know we have our handle</span> <span data-start="863.3" data-end="865.1">function and then we our a sink await</span> <span data-start="865.1" data-end="866.839">function and it gets split in two and</span> <span data-start="866.839" data-end="869.39">there is a bunch of tiny thing in here</span> <span data-start="869.39" data-end="871.399">which says one frame with no file and</span> <span data-start="871.399" data-end="872.87">this is you know there are some</span> <span data-start="872.87" data-end="875.12">throwaway called throwaway promises in</span> <span data-start="875.12" data-end="878.12">its gets you see some artifacts due to</span> <span data-start="878.12" data-end="880.37">our promises work and you know and this</span> <span data-start="880.37" data-end="881.959">is a completing of the hallway promise</span> <span data-start="881.959" data-end="883.579">that goes nowhere this promise is</span> <span data-start="883.579" data-end="885.8">completely like generated to just</span> <span data-start="885.8" data-end="889.959">fulfill some spec need whatever anyway</span> <span data-start="889.959" data-end="893.329">this is with the sink await and you know</span> <span data-start="893.329" data-end="896.68">then another step interesting it's just</span> <span data-start="896.68" data-end="899.779">just use callbacks you know why we are</span> <span data-start="899.779" data-end="901.49">using this type of thing why can't we</span> <span data-start="901.49" data-end="903.98">just use callbacks and let's do another</span> <span data-start="903.98" data-end="906.98">example that's calling FS read file one</span> <span data-start="906.98" data-end="909.709">of the parameters of nodejs so we go</span> <span data-start="909.709" data-end="912.77">back here and we are running our files</span> <span data-start="912.77" data-end="916.82">example and I think loosing tab but it's</span> <span data-start="916.82" data-end="919.07">not a really good idea so a lot of files</span> <span data-start="919.07" data-end="921.44">in there so we are running it and</span> <span data-start="921.44" data-end="924.17">generating some bunch of things and here</span> <span data-start="924.17" data-end="927.04">we go</span> <span data-start="927.04" data-end="932.57">some magic sprinkling I don't know here</span> <span data-start="932.57" data-end="933.079">we go</span> <span data-start="933.079" data-end="934.88">now you can see that is another a</span> <span data-start="934.88" data-end="936.56">slightly different one this is fully</span> <span data-start="936.56" data-end="938.81">linear let me zoom in okay you can see</span> <span data-start="938.81" data-end="940.43">in this blah blah</span> <span data-start="940.43" data-end="942.02">there's a lot of brown activity which is</span> <span data-start="942.02" data-end="944.18">a reading of files a bunch of scheduling</span> <span data-start="944.18" data-end="945.74">activity which is the purple and then</span> <span data-start="945.74" data-end="948.05">some green one which is data so we have</span> <span data-start="948.05" data-end="950">these blocks of brown activity in here</span> <span data-start="950" data-end="952.19">that you can see and you know the third</span> <span data-start="952.19" data-end="953.36">let's click on the first one and the</span> <span data-start="953.36" data-end="956.57">first one is our f1 function and you can</span> <span data-start="956.57" data-end="958.46">see oh maybe as we are reading a file so</span> <span data-start="958.46" data-end="960.2">this is scheduling our rid of the file</span> <span data-start="960.2" data-end="962.87">then we have this next block afterwards</span> <span data-start="962.87" data-end="965.27">which is in fact a combination of three</span> <span data-start="965.27" data-end="966.74">different a synchronous activities</span> <span data-start="966.74" data-end="968.99">because no J yes in order to read that</span> <span data-start="968.99" data-end="971.03">file is actually accessing the file</span> <span data-start="971.03" data-end="973.16">system three times and is completely in</span> <span data-start="973.16" data-end="974.54">it for you you just call a fast read</span> <span data-start="974.54" data-end="977.12">file but it's segmented and it makes</span> <span data-start="977.12" data-end="980.06">things interleaved so that it you can</span> <span data-start="980.06" data-end="981.68">use multiple signals activity at the</span> <span data-start="981.68" data-end="984.08">same time and he's doing treat and is</span> <span data-start="984.08" data-end="985.43">doing three things and it's calling this</span> <span data-start="985.43" data-end="987.35">function read file after open which is</span> <span data-start="987.35" data-end="989.33">totally an old call thing and we are not</span> <span data-start="989.33" data-end="990.95">should not really worry too much about</span> <span data-start="990.95" data-end="991.43">it</span> <span data-start="991.43" data-end="993.35">and now we have the first we have the</span> <span data-start="993.35" data-end="995.63">first file and then the second file and</span> <span data-start="995.63" data-end="998.05">then the third file okay this seems I</span> <span data-start="998.05" data-end="1004.12">can understand this so let's switch to a</span> <span data-start="1004.12" data-end="1006.88">sink await okay now you should have</span> <span data-start="1006.88" data-end="1008.71">learned we should have seen that it</span> <span data-start="1008.71" data-end="1011.11">changes significantly the structure of</span> <span data-start="1011.11" data-end="1016.33">my application and it's it's actually</span> <span data-start="1016.33" data-end="1019.12">very it's actually very useful because</span> <span data-start="1019.12" data-end="1020.44">it moved from something that is very</span> <span data-start="1020.44" data-end="1022.12">hard to read and very hard to maintain</span> <span data-start="1022.12" data-end="1024.55">or something this is way better to read</span> <span data-start="1024.55" data-end="1027.459">and maintain so yeah I like it right</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1027.459" data-end="1032.74">I'm a fan by the way and so what is</span> <span data-start="1032.74" data-end="1035.74">happening it's now you can see that the</span> <span data-start="1035.74" data-end="1038.95">the actual bubble prof art as we call it</span> <span data-start="1038.95" data-end="1042.13">it is slightly different than them</span> <span data-start="1042.13" data-end="1044.94">before because you can see that there is</span> <span data-start="1044.94" data-end="1047.53">way more scheduling activity happening</span> <span data-start="1047.53" data-end="1049.87">and you can see where the throw away</span> <span data-start="1049.87" data-end="1051.22">promises are so there is at Rahway</span> <span data-start="1051.22" data-end="1052.99">promise here via KHOU we are actually</span> <span data-start="1052.99" data-end="1054.91">calling a sink await three times as I</span> <span data-start="1054.91" data-end="1056.83">wait three times so we have three throw</span> <span data-start="1056.83" data-end="1058.93">away promises and we have one here one</span> <span data-start="1058.93" data-end="1064.27">here and one here now there is and we</span> <span data-start="1064.27" data-end="1065.77">can now understand how things are</span> <span data-start="1065.77" data-end="1067.21">getting interleaved between each other</span> <span data-start="1067.21" data-end="1069.94">and how we can use this information to</span> <span data-start="1069.94" data-end="1073.47">write better code and maybe fix problems</span> <span data-start="1073.47" data-end="1076.92">one more thing it's we have written our</span> <span data-start="1076.92" data-end="1080.85">code in this way now we can also very</span> <span data-start="1080.85" data-end="1084.36">quickly write our code to be Impa in</span> <span data-start="1084.36" data-end="1088.77">parallel note that changing a bunch of</span> <span data-start="1088.77" data-end="1091.41">code back he'll functions to be parallel</span> <span data-start="1091.41" data-end="1093.84">it's hard doing it with the sink away it</span> <span data-start="1093.84" data-end="1095.07">is a matter of changing three lines of</span> <span data-start="1095.07" data-end="1098.19">code so benefit there note that I'm not</span> <span data-start="1098.19" data-end="1108.76">using a weight and let's see how it goes</span> <span data-start="1108.77" data-end="1118.47">take some time here we go I'm zoom in</span> <span data-start="1118.47" data-end="1121.17">and now now you can see that in fact the</span> <span data-start="1121.17" data-end="1123.06">truth we throw away promises that we</span> <span data-start="1123.06" data-end="1125.1">were talking before I have gone I have</span> <span data-start="1125.1" data-end="1128.04">disappeared and we now have our only</span> <span data-start="1128.04" data-end="1130.26">three blocks of reading our files and we</span> <span data-start="1130.26" data-end="1132.18">can unpack this web and you can see that</span> <span data-start="1132.18" data-end="1134.07">you know there is all the the things</span> <span data-start="1134.07" data-end="1136.65">will get generated properly and stuff</span> <span data-start="1136.65" data-end="1138.3">like that and there is a lot of</span> <span data-start="1138.3" data-end="1140.7">information that you can that you can</span> <span data-start="1140.7" data-end="1142.35">gather from this tool and to visualize</span> <span data-start="1142.35"
