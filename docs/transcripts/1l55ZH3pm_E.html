data-start="136.98" data-end="140.61">and your production workloads not going</span> <span data-start="140.61" data-end="142.68">to be too technical and not going too</span> <span data-start="142.68" data-end="145.62">deep inside any JavaScript code and it's</span> <span data-start="145.62" data-end="147.33">all based on the experience I gained</span> <span data-start="147.33" data-end="149.28">working I dance at Dyson I've been</span> <span data-start="149.28" data-end="151.14">working at Dyson for almost two years</span> <span data-start="151.14" data-end="155.16">now and Anna has been great and we have</span> <span data-start="155.16" data-end="156.33">learned a lot about testing in</span> <span data-start="156.33" data-end="159.93">production so this is a quick summary of</span> <span data-start="159.93" data-end="162.96">where I'm going I'm going to answer why</span> <span data-start="162.96" data-end="164.43">do you need testing testing production</span> <span data-start="164.43" data-end="168.21">was the right testing level how can you</span> <span data-start="168.21" data-end="171">escape or noise no js' work help with</span> <span data-start="171" data-end="173.82">this how to avoid disrupting the real</span> <span data-start="173.82" data-end="175.38">users because if you're testing in</span> <span data-start="175.38" data-end="178.5">production you're gonna be part of your</span> <span data-start="178.5" data-end="180.42">users and you're going to be using</span> <span data-start="180.42" data-end="184.2">production systems how to keep how to</span> <span data-start="184.2" data-end="185.88">keep your tests out of the statistics</span> <span data-start="185.88" data-end="189.03">reports and out of metrics so when you</span> <span data-start="189.03" data-end="192.27">report your to your manager to hire the</span> <span data-start="192.27" data-end="196.91">business didn't get you results and then</span> <span data-start="196.91" data-end="200.31">why you should clean up and what happens</span> <span data-start="200.31" data-end="202.68">if you don't because that happened to us</span> <span data-start="202.68" data-end="207.48">so yeah let's dive in a bit why do you</span> <span data-start="207.48" data-end="209.76">need testing in production well that's a</span> <span data-start="209.76" data-end="211.86">good question by how most of you can</span> <span data-start="211.86" data-end="214.92">answer that but really what do I mean</span> <span data-start="214.92" data-end="216.989">why what do I mean by testing in</span> <span data-start="216.989" data-end="219.33">production when you deploy your</span> <span data-start="219.33" data-end="221.91">application it could be an application a</span> <span data-start="221.91" data-end="223.86">service could be a lambda whatever thing</span> <span data-start="223.86" data-end="226.29">you deploy to production and has so the</span> <span data-start="226.29" data-end="229.26">public has access to is you need to</span> <span data-start="229.26" data-end="233.4">guarantee it's continues to work over</span> <span data-start="233.4" data-end="236.76">the days and over the hours and it's not</span> <span data-start="236.76" data-end="239.28">just it passed the unit test it passed</span> <span data-start="239.28" data-end="241.53">the service level test or whatever and</span> <span data-start="241.53" data-end="243.9">then I deploy and I don't care about my</span> <span data-start="243.9" data-end="245.37">service the service is running in</span> <span data-start="245.37" data-end="247.05">production and if something happens to</span> <span data-start="247.05" data-end="250.32">it you want to get notified not at the</span> <span data-start="250.32" data-end="254.91">user but by some automated system so the</span> <span data-start="254.91" data-end="257.28">idea about this is to have some kind of</span> <span data-start="257.28" data-end="260.19">testing tool that runs on a scheduled</span> <span data-start="260.19" data-end="261.41">basis</span> <span data-start="261.41" data-end="264.75">so it's testing your service like it was</span> <span data-start="264.75" data-end="267.479">a real user and if something happens so</span> <span data-start="267.479" data-end="269.759">the tests fail it means that a real user</span> <span data-start="269.759" data-end="272.4">wasn't able to do one of the actions you</span> <span data-start="272.4" data-end="273.84">have defined for your production</span> <span data-start="273.84" data-end="276.03">services and and then you get a</span> <span data-start="276.03" data-end="278.699">notification so let's let's dive into it</span> <span data-start="278.699" data-end="282.81">a bit why really do you need a testing</span> <span data-start="282.81" data-end="284.94">you need testing in production so here's</span> <span data-start="284.94" data-end="287.91">a quick sample it might seem dumb but it</span> <span data-start="287.91" data-end="289.62">can happen so imagine you have a lambda</span> <span data-start="289.62" data-end="291.199">function that we change the current date</span> <span data-start="291.199" data-end="295.13">right and it doesn't cut it for the year</span> <span data-start="295.13" data-end="297.93">2038 problem which is when you are</span> <span data-start="297.93" data-end="302.12">storing your date in a sign it 32-bits</span> <span data-start="302.12" data-end="305.52">variable you've run out of space to</span> <span data-start="305.52" data-end="308.52">store the date and then you overflow</span> <span data-start="308.52" data-end="313.49">right on the 16th of january 2038</span> <span data-start="313.49" data-end="316.68">so yeah you do your deployment you write</span> <span data-start="316.68" data-end="319.139">unit tests for it issue which on a date</span> <span data-start="319.139" data-end="321.389">if you query for the date again you</span> <span data-start="321.389" data-end="322.979">should return a different number should</span> <span data-start="322.979" data-end="325.83">return a different date yeah do you know</span> <span data-start="325.83" data-end="326.729">unit tests are fine</span> <span data-start="326.729" data-end="328.8">do you deploy it and after a handful of</span> <span data-start="328.8" data-end="332.639">years is stuff failing and it's because</span> <span data-start="332.639" data-end="335.55">a it has dynamic input/output it depends</span> <span data-start="335.55" data-end="340.11">on the current time on how the users are</span> <span data-start="340.11" data-end="342.24">interacting with the service or what the</span> <span data-start="342.24" data-end="344.97">service is returning dynamically but</span> <span data-start="344.97" data-end="348.33">going to a more real situation imagine</span> <span data-start="348.33" data-end="350.34">one of your stateful services so it's a</span> <span data-start="350.34" data-end="352.56">service that store some state on your</span> <span data-start="352.56" data-end="355.889">users or in your database or on the</span> <span data-start="355.889" data-end="358.59">state of your system then suddenly by a</span> <span data-start="358.59" data-end="361.05">bug or whatever becomes inconsistent and</span> <span data-start="361.05" data-end="362.82">then starts failing for all the</span> <span data-start="362.82" data-end="366.75">customers then when you have is a horde</span> <span data-start="366.75" data-end="370.86">of customers chasing you angry customers</span> <span data-start="370.86" data-end="374.09">saying this is not working I pay for it</span> <span data-start="374.09" data-end="377.09">but you don't want that you want</span> <span data-start="377.09" data-end="379.56">something that it's not going to get</span> <span data-start="379.56" data-end="382.259">angry at you and it's a robot an</span> <span data-start="382.259" data-end="385.02">automated process that's gonna behave</span> <span data-start="385.02" data-end="387.3">like a user it's going to test your</span> <span data-start="387.3" data-end="389.76">things your services in production and</span> <span data-start="389.76" data-end="391.919">tell you when something bad happens so</span> <span data-start="391.919" data-end="394.05">you don't get the feedback</span> <span data-start="394.05" data-end="399.479">from the users and so if you compare</span> <span data-start="399.479" data-end="401.729">these two situations so imagine you are</span> <span data-start="401.729" data-end="403.319">in the first situation where you don't</span> <span data-start="403.319" data-end="404.849">have an automated test system in</span> <span data-start="404.849" data-end="407.25">production and then something bad</span> <span data-start="407.25" data-end="409.349">happens and all your customers come to</span> <span data-start="409.349" data-end="411.44">you saying this is no working and</span> <span data-start="411.44" data-end="415.83">claiming back the money it's gonna take</span> <span data-start="415.83" data-end="418.289">some time for the users to report to you</span> <span data-start="418.289" data-end="420.24">that I know is happening and they have</span> <span data-start="420.24" data-end="424.8">to go to your service helpdesk or log an</span> <span data-start="424.8" data-end="427.02">issue or log a ticket or send you an</span> <span data-start="427.02" data-end="429.21">email or whatever so it's slow you don't</span> <span data-start="429.21" data-end="432.09">know your service is failing until you</span> <span data-start="432.09" data-end="435.719">get the feedback from the users but if</span> <span data-start="435.719" data-end="437.52">you have an automated system that runs</span> <span data-start="437.52" data-end="439.83">every minute every 10 minute every 20</span> <span data-start="439.83" data-end="442.62">minutes every 30 minute you can</span> <span data-start="442.62" data-end="444.09">notifications about your system not</span> <span data-start="444.09" data-end="447.81">working like this and also if you're in</span> <span data-start="447.81" data-end="450.659">the first situation you're losing money</span> <span data-start="450.659" data-end="453.509">because then the more time you last in</span> <span data-start="453.509" data-end="455.4">detecting that your systems are not</span> <span data-start="455.4" data-end="457.74">working that's money that you are losing</span> <span data-start="457.74" data-end="460.38">and and also you're paying the support</span> <span data-start="460.38" data-end="463.8">the supporting a lot for dealing with</span> <span data-start="463.8" data-end="465.9">those things while you could have catch</span> <span data-start="465.9" data-end="469.65">the Europe beforehand and also the final</span> <span data-start="469.65" data-end="472.8">the final comparison is about the</span> <span data-start="472.8" data-end="475.259">company reputation so if you have all</span> <span data-start="475.259" data-end="477.33">the users coming back at you and saying</span> <span data-start="477.33" data-end="478.83">this is not working this is a high pay</span> <span data-start="478.83" data-end="480.84">for this blah blah blah your company</span> <span data-start="480.84" data-end="483.449">reputation is over the over the floor</span> <span data-start="483.449" data-end="486.449">and then if you have an automated system</span> <span data-start="486.449" data-end="490.5">that notifies you by the way of an issue</span> <span data-start="490.5" data-end="492.15">in your production systems</span> <span data-start="492.15" data-end="496.289">nobody needs to notice it and then you</span> <span data-start="496.289" data-end="498.81">fix it quickly and then customers are</span> <span data-start="498.81" data-end="501.93">happy so that's the comparison and why</span> <span data-start="501.93" data-end="505.86">do you need testing in production so</span> <span data-start="505.86" data-end="508.409">what really is the right level of</span> <span data-start="508.409" data-end="509.639">testing you want to perform in</span> <span data-start="509.639" data-end="512.849">production because you don't want to</span> <span data-start="512.849" data-end="515.399">mess with real data but you're using</span> <span data-start="515.399" data-end="518.789">real systems yeah so this is a the</span> <span data-start="518.789" data-end="521.399">testing pyramid well one of the many</span> <span data-start="521.399" data-end="527.14">testing permits are but let me focus</span> <span data-start="527.14" data-end="529.63">let me focus on this one because it's</span> <span data-start="529.63" data-end="532.09">one of the simplest that I found it</span> <span data-start="532.09" data-end="534.88">comes from Superman article in from</span> <span data-start="534.88" data-end="536.32">ultimate from their website ultimate</span> <span data-start="536.32" data-end="540.31">home automation Panda and at the bottom</span> <span data-start="540.31" data-end="542.77">you have unit test then integration test</span> <span data-start="542.77" data-end="545.11">or service level test however you want</span> <span data-start="545.11" data-end="546.55">to call them and then the end-to-end</span> <span data-start="546.55" data-end="550.24">test so what happens when you have a</span> <span data-start="550.24" data-end="552.25">unit test you want a unit test before</span> <span data-start="552.25" data-end="554.26">you deploy your application so you test</span> <span data-start="554.26" data-end="556">a single functions of your application</span> <span data-start="556" data-end="557.98">or your service and then you deploy your</span> <span data-start="557.98" data-end="559.96">application because you are confident</span> <span data-start="559.96" data-end="561.79">that your application is working fine</span> <span data-start="561.79" data-end="565.24">because you have unit tested it but then</span> <span data-start="565.24" data-end="568.48">when you deploy you perform some</span> <span data-start="568.48" data-end="570.31">integration tests or service level tests</span> <span data-start="570.31" data-end="572.62">so you're focusing on a single service</span> <span data-start="572.62" data-end="575.8">the single service is the minimum unit</span> <span data-start="575.8" data-end="577.87">after deployment for us the engineers</span> <span data-start="577.87" data-end="581.02">you deploy several services and so this</span> <span data-start="581.02" data-end="583.78">end-to-end test so this integration test</span> <span data-start="583.78" data-end="586.21">or survey level test for those single</span> <span data-start="586.21" data-end="589.27">units from the engineering side but what</span> <span data-start="589.27" data-end="592.15">the user sees is like the whole system</span> <span data-start="592.15" data-end="594.76">and the user has user intense user</span> <span data-start="594.76" data-end="597.6">actions or also called user journeys</span> <span data-start="597.6" data-end="600.46">they are testing things across all the</span> <span data-start="600.46" data-end="603.25">system across all your services so</span> <span data-start="603.25" data-end="606.46">that's the kind of level I'm referring</span> <span data-start="606.46" data-end="607.75">when I'm talking about testing in</span> <span data-start="607.75" data-end="609.97">production you want to become a real</span> <span data-start="609.97" data-end="611.92">user you want to be in the skin of a</span> <span data-start="611.92" data-end="614.56">user
