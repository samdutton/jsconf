data-end="258.82">great and that's when that's when we had</span> <span data-start="258.82" data-end="261.01">some issues we need to take care of we</span> <span data-start="261.01" data-end="263.41">have a fantastic group of engineers but</span> <span data-start="263.41" data-end="266.05">as a uit we wanted to try to solve those</span> <span data-start="266.05" data-end="268.69">issues on our own so what was happening</span> <span data-start="268.69" data-end="270.76">we were making numerous API calls and</span> <span data-start="270.76" data-end="273.539">doing a lot of hydration client-side and</span> <span data-start="273.539" data-end="277.78">it worked but the thing is we were doing</span> <span data-start="277.78" data-end="279.62">a lot of useless rerun during we</span> <span data-start="279.62" data-end="282.05">increased load times and we had like the</span> <span data-start="282.05"

<span data-start="298.33" data-end="300.44">optimizations and it was great it was</span> <span data-start="300.44" data-end="302.63">fun but we wanted to spend less time</span> <span data-start="302.63" data-end="304.85">debugging and more time building cool</span> <span data-start="304.85" data-end="307.76">software like we all do patches weren't</span> <span data-start="307.76" data-end="310.04">really doing the trick anymore so what</span> <span data-start="310.04" data-end="314.949">could we do react to the rescue</span> <span data-start="314.949" data-end="317.38">replacing backbone views with react</span> <span data-start="317.38" data-end="321.08">instant gratification I'm sure most of</span> <span data-start="321.08" data-end="324.11">you know what react is by now but just</span> <span data-start="324.11" data-end="326.9">as a quick recap reusable encapsulated</span> <span data-start="326.9" data-end="329.63">components it's got a

data-start="338.15" data-end="341">the app itself rather than coming up</span> <span data-start="341" data-end="342.5">with like nitty-gritty solutions to</span> <span data-start="342.5" data-end="344.96">making things work we just say hey react</span> <span data-start="344.96" data-end="346.91">we're going to give you some data render</span> <span data-start="346.91" data-end="348.74">it you know we're not going to tell it</span> <span data-start="348.74" data-end="351.229">how to do it and there was less mental</span> <span data-start="351.229" data-end="353.81">overhead with bringing in templates and</span> <span data-start="353.81" data-end="356.63">views together I know I know it's hard</span> <span data-start="356.63" data-end="358.01">thinking about putting those two things</span> <span data-start="358.01" data-end="360.74">together but trust me the world is great</span> <span data-start="360.74" data-end="362.57">after a couple of components you guys</span> <span data-start="362.57" data-end="365.75">will never go back and most importantly</span> <span data-start="365.75" data-end="368">for the first time ever our backends</span> <span data-start="368" data-end="369.56">were much more comfortable with working</span> <span data-start="369.56" data-end="372.74">with our code video BP was fantastic</span> <span data-start="372.74" data-end="374.69">from a UI perspective it did everything</span> <span data-start="374.69" data-end="377.78">we wanted it to do but our backends</span> <span data-start="377.78" data-end="380.09">didn't want to work with this or that</span> <span data-start="380.09" data-end="381.86">and it's not because they didn't want to</span> <span data-start="381.86" data-end="383.57">it's because it did get confusing you've</span> <span data-start="383.57" data-end="385.88">had to invest a lot of time up front to</span> <span data-start="385.88" data-end="387.47">understand how the framework works for</span> <span data-start="387.47" data-end="390.65">it to be effective right with react we</span> <span data-start="390.65" data-end="392.479">were able to move a lot of that stuff</span> <span data-start="392.479" data-end="394.669">over to the back ends and let them work</span> <span data-start="394.669" data-end="396.68">on their apps as well without really</span> <span data-start="396.68" data-end="399.08">interfering with the UI with the UI team</span> <span data-start="399.08" data-end="400.82">so we're like more the experts they</span> <span data-start="400.82" data-end="401.84">would come to if they need help</span> <span data-start="401.84" data-end="403.94">otherwise they're building great stuff</span> <span data-start="403.94" data-end="406.4">on their own too we started with a</span> <span data-start="406.4" data-end="408.44">simple drop down and now we're up to</span> <span data-start="408.44" data-end="410.78">about 80 components in each of our apps</span> <span data-start="410.78" data-end="412.76">and everything keeps growing our</span> <span data-start="412.76" data-end="413.96">components aren't</span> <span data-start="413.96" data-end="416.509">sarily huge but for the ones that are</span> <span data-start="416.509" data-end="419">and have a ton of

here</span> <span data-start="425.18" data-end="426.47">we are I don't know how well you can see</span> <span data-start="426.47" data-end="429.38">that but this is everything this is the</span> <span data-start="429.38" data-end="431.24">view in the template combined it might</span> <span data-start="431.24" data-end="432.8">look a little crazy but you have to</span> <span data-start="432.8" data-end="436.34">remember it's not HTML it's jsx which is</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="436.34" data-end="439.31">JavaScript and everything just made</span> <span data-start="439.31" data-end="442.22">sense so in this case I might be getting</span> <span data-start="442.22" data-end="443.9">ahead of myself here with props but</span> <span data-start="443.9" data-end="445.37">you've got a header then you've got a</span> <span data-start="445.37" data-end="447.53">logo and then things just trickle down</span> <span data-start="447.53" data-end="450.77">accordingly our code became much more</span> <span data-start="450.77" data-end="452.81">manageable that's a lot easier to</span> <span data-start="452.81" data-end="454.97">understand then Oh open up this view</span> <span data-start="454.97" data-end="457.039">that corresponds to this template but</span> <span data-start="457.039" data-end="459.41">then there's this like oh you know now</span> <span data-start="459.41" data-end="461">we use this like external

data-start="464.539" data-end="466.82">here in front of you and simple easy to</span> <span data-start="466.82" data-end="470.03">use files our backends our designers</span> <span data-start="470.03" data-end="475.19">everyone was a huge fan so speaking of</span> <span data-start="475.19" data-end="478.759">design it helped with CSS to it made</span> <span data-start="478.759" data-end="481.55">much more sense so what we started doing</span> <span data-start="481.55" data-end="483.47">is we started modeling our CSS classes</span> <span data-start="483.47" data-end="486.56">after our reactive components it's much</span> <span data-start="486.56" data-end="488.389">easier to traverse CSS and make changes</span> <span data-start="488.389" data-end="491">and designers are more comfortable</span> <span data-start="491" data-end="493.909">making those changes to there was a time</span> <span data-start="493.909" data-end="496.219">where you'd have you know thousands of</span> <span data-start="496.219" data-end="499.33">lines for a couple of simple things but</span> <span data-start="499.33" data-end="501.68">did it really make sense was it</span> <span data-start="501.68" data-end="504.44">effective was it maintainable those were</span> <span data-start="504.44" data-end="506.83">questions that we asked ourselves a new</span>

<span data-start="542" data-end="545.3">just good JavaScript right I'm guilty of</span> <span data-start="545.3" data-end="547.64">saying this but I had to look up call by</span> <span

all of our</span> <span data-start="726.23" data-end="728.42">backbone views it was sort of a good</span> <span data-start="728.42" data-end="730.01">habit to bring that over when we were</span> <span data-start="730.01" data-end="732.17">debugging we know right away oh that</span> <span data-start="732.17" data-end="734.27">must be coming from react let's check</span> <span data-start="734.27" data-end="736.91">the react folder had a time and so we</span> <span data-start="736.91" data-end="739.13">don't run into any weird issues we then</span> <span data-start="739.13" data-end="741.95">append that element to the backbone view</span> <span data-start="741.95" data-end="744.41">and then let react go from there just</span> <span data-start="744.41"

like</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="768.05" data-end="772.25">I said the use chaplain and it delivers</span> <span data-start="772.25" data-end="774.53">and it gives us controller so here we</span> <span data-start="774.53" data-end="776.84">are we do a lot of stuff with member</span> <span data-start="776.84" data-end="778.82">conversion and onboarding it's a huge</span> <span data-start="778.82"

a simple logo that stretches across</span> <span data-start="790.31" data-end="793.07">the top of your screen how can we get</span> <span data-start="793.07" data-end="795.8">that into the browser in a nice way</span> <span data-start="795.8" data-end="798.56">without freaking out too much so here we</span> <span data-start="798.56" data-end="801.55">go we use common J house we require that</span> <span data-start="801.55" data-end="804.17">module and then we create an element</span> <span data-start="804.17" data-end="805.7">with it sign up header as you can see</span> <span data-start="805.7" data-end="808.01">here there's one thing here that may</span> <span data-start="808.01" data-end="810.02">look a little weird and that's the reuse</span> <span data-start="810.02" data-end="812.21">it's it's a chaplain composition</span> <span data-start="812.21" data-end="814.76">function what that lets us do is</span> <span data-start="814.76" data-end="816.47">it grants us the ability to reuse data</span> <span data-start="816.47" data-end="818.69">and views beyond one controller action</span> <span data-start="818.69" data-end="820.76">it's a nice performance perk that we get</span> <span data-start="820.76" data-end="823.31">right out of the box so then like I said</span> <span data-start="823.31" data-end="825.89">element container and call back we've</span> <span data-start="825.89" data-end="828.2">got a sign-up header we've got a simple</span> <span data-start="828.2" data-end="831.53">utility function to get whatever that</span> <span data-start="831.53" data-end="833.09">header funk or whatever that wherever</span> <span data-start="833.09" data-end="835.19">that header lies we kind of query it</span> <span data-start="835.19" data-end="837.17">it's it's basically query selector</span> <span data-start="837.17" data-end="839.66">behind the scenes and then the call back</span> <span data-start="839.66" data-end="843.23">if you need it react gives you component</span> <span data-start="843.23" data-end="845.38">did mount if you need some sort of</span> <span data-start="845.38" data-end="847.43">utility method and you want to talk to</span> <span data-start="847.43" data-end="848.96">something but if you're looking for more</span> <span data-start="848.96" data-end="850.91">control via backbone that's what the</span> <span

data-end="857.36">engineers we always want to move forward</span> <span data-start="857.36" data-end="859.76">and so we started coming up with a react</span> <span data-start="859.76" data-end="862.61">backbone wrapper what it does is it</span> <span data-start="862.61" data-end="865.31">takes the adapt to the next level with</span> <span data-start="865.31" data-end="867.29">the adapter we're still using backbone</span> <span data-start="867.29" data-end="869.78">views we wanted to get rid of that</span> <span data-start="869.78" data-end="873.14">completely so the react backbone wrapper</span> <span data-start="873.14" data-end="876.53">makes an appt root level react</span> <span data-start="876.53" data-end="878.72">components and that completely releases</span> <span data-start="878.72" data-end="880.97">chaplain and all of the features that</span> <span data-start="880.97" data-end="882.92">come with it and let's react take care</span> <span data-start="882.92" data-end="885.47">of the whole show I think this is what</span> <span data-start="885.47" data-end="887.78">everyone loves about it because it was</span> <span data-start="887.78" data-end="890.33">so simple to insert and the ideas are</span> <span data-start="890.33" data-end="892.94">more or less the same but we extend the</span> <span data-start="892.94" data-end="895.1">adapter what we do is we check for</span> <span data-start="895.1" data-end="897.65">amounted component we check for updates</span> <span data-start="897.65" data-end="901.55">we pass in props which are properties</span> <span data-start="901.55" data-end="902.96">which we'll talk about in just a second</span> <span data-start="902.96" data-end="905.81">we find the note in the Dom apply that</span> <span data-start="905.81" data-end="907.43">identifier class that's how much ADA to</span> <span data-start="907.43" data-end="910.01">reacted rapper and then just render and</span> <span data-start="910.01" data-end="913.01">then we're good to go no delays no</span> <span data-start="913.01" data-end="915.98">performance lags it just works we're</span> <span data-start="915.98" data-end="917.33">still in the process of tweaking this so</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="917.33" data-end="918.41">I don't want to get too far ahead of</span> <span data-start="918.41" data-end="921.97">myself but it's worked great thus far</span> <span

<p><span data-start="1103.99" data-end="1107.83">I'll mention this to pro tip passing a</span> <span data-start="1107.83" data-end="1111.34">key whenever you do a map its reacts way</span> <span data-start="1111.34" data-end="1113.8">of doing a reconciliation making sure</span> <span data-start="1113.8" data-end="1115.39">there's nothing weird that happens it</span> <span data-start="1115.39"

data-end="1131.86">messages it'll console everything out</span> <span data-start="1131.86" data-end="1133.69">and let you know exactly what you should</span> <span data-start="1133.69" data-end="1136.6">stack overflow or Google for so don't</span> <span data-start="1136.6" data-end="1141.13">worry about it too much now we've passed</span> <span data-start="1141.13" data-end="1143.44">down props we talked about state but the</span> <span data-start="1143.44" data-end="1145.54">most important part of this is how does</span> <span data-start="1145.54" data-end="1147.85">react know that our model has been</span> <span data-start="1147.85" data-end="1149.77">updated or we change something or our</span> <span data-start="1149.77" data-end="1151.78">collections been updated this is where</span> <span data-start="1151.78" data-end="1153.61">the backbone react component mixin comes</span> <span data-start="1153.61" data-end="1155.92">from it'll glue your backbone model and</span> <span data-start="1155.92" data-end="1158.77">collections and to react components this</span> <span data-start="1158.77" data-end="1161.32">was made by jose miguel hayes and it's</span> <span data-start="1161.32" data-end="1164.17">been a fantastic part of our workflow so</span> <span data-start="1164.17" data-end="1165.79">once your component is mounted a rapper</span> <span data-start="1165.79" data-end="1167.11">starts listening in the models and</span> <span data-start="1167.11" data-end="1169.33">collection changes to automatically set</span> <span data-start="1169.33" data-end="1171.13">components stave and the cheap you I</span> <span data-start="1171.13" data-end="1175.03">binding through reactive updates here's</span> <span data-start="1175.03" data-end="1178.3">a very simple example get model member</span> <span data-start="1178.3" data-end="1179.95">is sinking if it's sinking let's show a</span> <span data-start="1179.95" data-end="1182.02">loading indicator otherwise let's load</span> <span data-start="1182.02" data-end="1184.27">that member information it's super</span> <span data-start="1184.27" data-end="1186.07">simple and it's that easy there's no</span> <span data-start="1186.07" data-end="1191.13">weird things happening it just works so</span> <span data-start="1191.13" data-end="1194.56">um this mix and gives us some awesome</span> <span data-start="1194.56" data-end="1196.99">helper methods because as you recall</span> <span data-start="1196.99" data-end="1199.51">props are immutable you can't change</span> <span data-start="1199.51" data-end="1201.25">them but sometimes you want to update</span> <span data-start="1201.25" data-end="1202.93">that model you want to update a first</span> <span data-start="1202.93" data-end="1204.4">and last name you want to update an</span> <span data-start="1204.4" data-end="1206.35">email address you have to change that</span> <span data-start="1206.35" data-end="1209.74">stuff so what we get is two really great</span> <span data-start="1209.74" data-end="1212.29">helper functions this not yet model and</span> <span data-start="1212.29" data-end="1214.48">this dock collection or this not get</span> <span data-start="1214.48" data-end="1215.53">collection</span> <span data-start="1215.53" data-end="1218.08">when you're using just one model you can</span> <span data-start="1218.08" data-end="1221.08">just do this dot get model get name and</span> <span data-start="1221.08" data-end="1223.48">when you're using numerous you kind of</span> <span data-start="1223.48" data-end="1225.22">just use that namespace we talked about</span> <span data-start="1225.22" data-end="1228.91">previously get modeled member get name</span> <span data-start="1228.91" data-end="1232.03">and then setting works the same way I</span> <span data-start="1232.03" data-end="1234.52">get model that address that set zip code</span> <span data-start="1234.52" data-end="1236.43">and then whatever your zip code maybe</span> <span data-start="1236.43" data-end="1240.19">get collection same idea you saw that</span> <span data-start="1240.19" data-end="1242.23">earlier and we were looping over an</span> <span data-start="1242.23" data-end="1249.04">array of models so there are some</span> <span data-start="1249.04" data-end="1251.29">gotchas that we faced especially if you</span> <span data-start="1251.29" data-end="1253.63">are using CoffeeScript like i said</span> <span data-start="1253.63"

data-end="1271.3">returns in CoffeeScript sometimes those</span> <span data-start="1271.3" data-end="1273.25">will bite you in the butt right remember</span> <span data-start="1273.25" data-end="1275.08">to wrap a series of components in a</span> <span data-start="1275.08" data-end="1276.94">parent div otherwise it won't render</span> <span data-start="1276.94" data-end="1279.97">like you want it to since what react</span> <span data-start="1279.97" data-end="1285.34">does is it renders or it renders the it</span> <span data-start="1285.34"
