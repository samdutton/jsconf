standards at Adobe</span> <span data-start="10.349" data-end="12.48">I am co-chair of the CSS working group</span> <span data-start="12.48" data-end="16.5">but last week it was my other co-chair</span> <span data-start="16.5" data-end="20.789">who managed to get riding modes resolved</span> <span data-start="20.789" data-end="23.16">to go to propose recommendations so I</span> <span data-start="23.16" data-end="26.939">don't get to claim much for that one I'm</span> <span data-start="26.939" data-end="30">going to talk to you today about how all</span> <span data-start="30" data-end="34.02">of you can help getting browser bugs</span> <span data-start="34.02" data-end="35.85">fast I'm going to start with a little</span> <span data-start="35.85" data-end="39.51">bit of audience participation everybody</span> <span data-start="39.51" data-end="41.61">here does some kind of web development</span> <span data-start="41.61" data-end="44.219">how many people here raise your hand if</span> <span data-start="44.219" data-end="48.87">you have run into a browser bug so many</span> <span data-start="48.87" data-end="52.59">bugs all right of all you people which</span> <span data-start="52.59" data-end="54.09">is almost everybody who has run into a</span> <span data-start="54.09" data-end="56.01">browser bug how many people have</span> <span data-start="56.01" data-end="59.69">actually reported the bug that you found</span> <span data-start="59.69" data-end="63.239">that's about what I usually see maybe</span> <span data-start="63.239" data-end="69.33">10% yeah I'm hoping by the time I end</span> <span data-start="69.33" data-end="73.56">this presentation more people will feel</span> <span data-start="73.56" data-end="78.6">empowered to log browser bugs help them</span> <span data-start="78.6" data-end="81.259">nudge them along the way to being fixed</span> <span data-start="81.259" data-end="85.08">and I'm gonna tell you about the things</span> <span data-start="85.08" data-end="87.24">that I've found have been effective at</span> <span data-start="87.24" data-end="89.28">getting browser developers to actually</span> <span data-start="89.28" data-end="93.72">do something for you so why should you</span> <span data-start="93.72" data-end="96.84">care you run into a browser bug you find</span> <span data-start="96.84" data-end="99.93">a solution and you go along your merry</span> <span data-start="99.93" data-end="106.439">way if you're anything like me you find</span> <span data-start="106.439" data-end="109.71">the bug you figure out a solution you go</span> <span data-start="109.71" data-end="113.25">along and sometime later months years</span> <span data-start="113.25" data-end="115.259">maybe even weeks you run into the same</span> <span data-start="115.259" data-end="117.149">bug again and you've forgotten what the</span> <span data-start="117.149" data-end="119.31">solution was and you have to go through</span> <span data-start="119.31" data-end="123.659">the effort of solving some of the else's</span> <span data-start="123.659" data-end="124.33">problem</span> <span data-start="124.33" data-end="127.78">again so yes you managed to get a</span> <span data-start="127.78" data-end="129.91">browser bug fixed that means there's one</span> <span data-start="129.91" data-end="131.41">less thing that you have to do you're</span> <span data-start="131.41" data-end="135.73">helping future you but it's not just</span> <span data-start="135.73" data-end="140.68">yourself you're also helping hundreds or</span> <span data-start="140.68" data-end="142.39">thousands and developers around the</span> <span data-start="142.39" data-end="144.31">world who will also run into this bug</span> <span data-start="144.31" data-end="146.17">maybe some other people in this room</span> <span data-start="146.17" data-end="148.3">will run into the same bug that you do</span> <span data-start="148.3" data-end="152.86">and if you all can manage to get the bug</span> <span data-start="152.86" data-end="155.14">fixed that's one less thing for other</span> <span data-start="155.14" data-end="160.64">developers to worry about but also a</span> <span data-start="160.65" data-end="165.66">more bug free web helps users of the web</span> <span data-start="165.66" data-end="169.21">a better environment for browsing is</span> <span data-start="169.21" data-end="172.27">better for everybody and the less bugs</span> <span data-start="172.27" data-end="174.64">there are the more that web developers</span> <span data-start="174.64" data-end="177.13">like yourselves can do things for your</span> <span data-start="177.13" data-end="180.01">users and getting a browser bug fixed</span> <span data-start="180.01" data-end="182.05">means that billions of people around the</span> <span data-start="182.05" data-end="184.54">world have a better time in their</span> <span data-start="184.54" data-end="190.989">browsers and I apologize I don't maybe I</span> <span data-start="190.989" data-end="193.69">need to shave my beard for presentations</span> <span data-start="193.69" data-end="196.239">the microphone always seems to rustle a</span> <span data-start="196.239" data-end="199.709">little bit and I'm sorry about that so</span> <span data-start="199.709" data-end="202.27">what can you do to fix about well</span> <span data-start="202.27" data-end="206.05">browsers are open source so your</span> <span data-start="206.05" data-end="208">developers you could go fix the bug</span> <span data-start="208" data-end="211.78">yourself it is possible I worked at a</span> <span data-start="211.78" data-end="214.239">team on Adobe that did this very thing</span> <span data-start="214.239" data-end="216.489">we fix bugs in lots of browsers we added</span> <span data-start="216.489" data-end="221.86">features to lots of browsers but it's</span> <span data-start="221.86" data-end="227.29">not really what I expect anybody to do</span> <span data-start="227.29" data-end="229.45">we no longer do it ourselves it wasn't</span> <span data-start="229.45" data-end="231.1">really a cost-effective thing we</span> <span data-start="231.1" data-end="233.08">couldn't really justify the expense of</span> <span data-start="233.08" data-end="235.36">having a team fixing bugs in browsers</span> <span data-start="235.36" data-end="238.06">because there are people where it's</span> <span data-start="238.06" data-end="239.77">their job to fix bugs</span> <span data-start="239.77" data-end="242.41">there are browser engineers funded in</span> <span data-start="242.41" data-end="245.86">some cases by companies that have lots</span> <span data-start="245.86" data-end="248.35">of money so they really should do their</span> <span data-start="248.35" data-end="249.63">job and</span> <span data-start="249.63" data-end="253.42">there are ways in which we as users of</span> <span data-start="253.42" data-end="256">the platform we as developers can help</span> <span data-start="256" data-end="258.94">them to nudge them along to fixing the</span> <span data-start="258.94" data-end="262.6">bugs that are the worst things in our</span> <span data-start="262.6" data-end="266.02">development life so what I'm going to</span> <span data-start="266.02" data-end="268.84">talk to you today about is how to</span> <span data-start="268.84" data-end="271.2">influence browser developers how to</span> <span data-start="271.2" data-end="275.08">nudge them along things that I found</span> <span data-start="275.08" data-end="278.5">effective both in my own life and in</span> <span data-start="278.5" data-end="280.45">what I hear from other people and</span> <span data-start="280.45" data-end="283.12">getting browser browser developers to</span> <span data-start="283.12" data-end="288.84">fix the bugs that are important the one</span> <span data-start="288.84" data-end="295.33">basic if nothing else just do this one</span> <span data-start="295.33" data-end="297.31">thing it's just make sure the bug is</span> <span data-start="297.31" data-end="300.85">reported there are a number of search</span> <span data-start="300.85" data-end="303.49">engines this is one of them that will</span> <span data-start="303.49" data-end="306.34">search through all of the bug bases for</span> <span data-start="306.34" data-end="308.08">all of the browser's all placed all the</span> <span data-start="308.08" data-end="310.27">major browsers and let you know whether</span> <span data-start="310.27" data-end="313.06">a bug has already been reported so at</span> <span data-start="313.06" data-end="314.74">the very least you can go and see</span> <span data-start="314.74" data-end="317.11">whether something needs to be done about</span> <span data-start="317.11" data-end="322.36">this rug if you find the bug that is</span> <span data-start="322.36" data-end="327.39">causing you trouble the easiest most</span> <span data-start="327.39" data-end="329.979">cost-effective thing you can do is just</span> <span data-start="329.979" data-end="333.28">a vote for it you might not think that</span> <span data-start="333.28" data-end="335.86">this would make much of a difference but</span> <span data-start="335.86" data-end="338.59">it actually does I've been in meetings</span> <span data-start="338.59" data-end="340.87">with browser developers talking about a</span> <span data-start="340.87" data-end="344.139">particular bug sometimes about that they</span> <span data-start="344.139" data-end="346.419">know has been around for a long time but</span> <span data-start="346.419" data-end="351.25">they've told me point-blank I can't get</span> <span data-start="351.25" data-end="352.99">anybody to fix this bug because it only</span> <span data-start="352.99" data-end="355.479">has ten votes and these other bugs over</span> <span data-start="355.479" data-end="357.82">here have 200 votes and so these are the</span> <span data-start="357.82" data-end="360.43">ones that I'm gonna actually spend some</span> <span data-start="360.43" data-end="363.81">time fixing so if you can find a bug</span> <span data-start="363.81" data-end="366.49">please and it's kind of causing you pain</span> <span data-start="366.49" data-end="369.28">please vote for it there's like a plus</span> <span data-start="369.28" data-end="372.82">one a favorite a follow in these bug</span> <span data-start="372.82" data-end="374.33">systems</span> <span data-start="374.33" data-end="378.059">that gives the browser developers some</span> <span data-start="378.059" data-end="380.729">sense of priority on what actually needs</span> <span data-start="380.729" data-end="383.519">to be fixed element platforms and it's</span> <span data-start="383.519" data-end="387.449">not just bugs new features are all</span> <span data-start="387.449" data-end="391.08">listed in these bug in these but</span> <span data-start="391.08" data-end="395.489">repositories has bugs so if say you were</span> <span data-start="395.489" data-end="400.889">interested in having paintwork let's be</span> <span data-start="400.889" data-end="403.11">implemented in more browsers you can go</span> <span data-start="403.11" data-end="404.519">to the browsers that don't implement</span> <span data-start="404.519" data-end="407.129">them and find a bug that says implement</span> <span data-start="407.129" data-end="409.409">paint worklet and vote for that bug and</span> <span data-start="409.409" data-end="412.889">that will help the browser engineers get</span> <span data-start="412.889" data-end="415.199">around to implementing pig worklets and</span> <span data-start="415.199" data-end="416.699">making them something that you can use</span> <span data-start="416.699" data-end="422.369">all over the web you can also put new</span> <span data-start="422.369" data-end="426.659">information in bug comments if you came</span> <span data-start="426.659" data-end="428.459">at the bug from a slightly different</span> <span data-start="428.459" data-end="432.479">direction putting new steps in is a</span> <span data-start="432.479" data-end="434.759">really good thing to do the only thing</span> <span data-start="434.759" data-end="436.529">that you should not do in a bug comment</span> <span data-start="436.529" data-end="438.569">is actually just do a plus one because</span> <span data-start="438.569" data-end="440.789">the voting mechanisms are there for that</span> <span data-start="440.789" data-end="445.439">and if you can't find the bug just write</span> <span data-start="445.439" data-end="449.189">it up it can be a very quick thing or it</span> <span data-start="449.189" data-end="451.139">can be a very involved thing depending</span> <span data-start="451.139" data-end="452.61">on how much effort you want to put into</span> <span data-start="452.61" data-end="453.929">it</span> <span data-start="453.929" data-end="457.919">and don't worry about adding a duplicate</span> <span data-start="457.919" data-end="460.439">bug to these systems if you've made a</span> <span data-start="460.439" data-end="463.74">good-faith effort to find the bug and</span> <span data-start="463.74" data-end="464.699">you haven't found it</span> <span data-start="464.699" data-end="468.839">riding a bug and letting some browser</span> <span data-start="468.839" data-end="470.999">engineer do some triaging and say oh no</span> <span data-start="470.999" data-end="473.849">it's actually this mug over here is</span> <span data-start="473.849" data-end="476.249">perfectly fine and that just means that</span> <span data-start="476.249" data-end="478.019">the next person that goes and tries to</span> <span data-start="478.019" data-end="481.169">find the that bug with the search terms</span> <span data-start="481.169" data-end="482.819">that you used they'll find your</span> <span data-start="482.819" data-end="484.86">duplicate it'll link to the actual bug</span> <span data-start="484.86" data-end="487.829">and so in some cases like this</span> <span data-start="487.829" data-end="491.57">duplicates are a fine and good thing</span> <span data-start="491.57" data-end="496.49">so you've gone and logged a bug or you</span> <span data-start="496.49" data-end="498.74">found the bug and you voted on it so</span> <span data-start="498.74" data-end="505.74">you're done right all bugs get fixed or</span> <span data-start="505.75" data-end="509.24">sometimes they just hang out forever and</span> <span data-start="509.24" data-end="512.54">get closed as one fixed after 20 years</span> <span data-start="512.54" data-end="518.09">of being around so there are some things</span> <span data-start="518.09" data-end="519.77">that you can do to improve your chances</span> <span data-start="519.77" data-end="524.03">of getting a bug fixed and they're</span> <span data-start="524.03" data-end="527.75">mainly just writing a good bug making</span> <span data-start="527.75" data-end="531.5">sure that the steps to the bug are the</span> <span data-start="531.5" data-end="533.21">smallest number of steps that can</span> <span data-start="533.21" data-end="535.82">possibly be quite a few bugs that</span> <span data-start="535.82" data-end="537.95">browser developers get from outside</span> <span data-start="537.95" data-end="541.78">their projects or load this URL and</span> <span data-start="541.78" data-end="546.11">things don't look good that's not much</span> <span data-start="546.11" data-end="546.86">to go on</span> <span data-start="546.86" data-end="550.79">so if you can reduce the thing that is</span> <span data-start="550.79" data-end="552.59">going wrong to just a few lines of code</span> <span data-start="552.59" data-end="555.74">and say here's what needs to be fixed to</span> <span data-start="555.74" data-end="558.89">make things better for me it's much more</span> <span data-start="558.89" data-end="561.59">likely that a browser engineer is going</span> <span data-start="561.59" data-end="564.2">to actually do something about it</span> <span data-start="564.2" data-end="566.87">you can add examples to a bug you can</span> <span data-start="566.87" data-end="571.19">show what the repercussions of the bug</span> <span data-start="571.19" data-end="574.04">are that will give the browser developer</span> <span data-start="574.04" data-end="578.3">more to go on when they go and have to</span> <span data-start="578.3" data-end="580.34">fight for spending time to fix a</span> <span data-start="580.34" data-end="583.25">particular bug and finally the most</span> <span data-start="583.25" data-end="585.8">effective thing that you can do is to is</span> <span data-start="585.8" data-end="589.07">to add a test case the browser developer</span> <span data-start="589.07" data-end="590.87">when they fix the bug they're going to</span> <span data-start="590.87" data-end="592.97">have to go add a test case or a set of</span> <span data-start="592.97" data-end="595.67">test cases themselves so you can do a</span> <span data-start="595.67" data-end="598.49">little bit of work to help the browser</span> <span data-start="598.49" data-end="600.62">developer and that'll make it more</span> <span data-start="600.62" data-end="602.5">likely that they'll actually get around</span> <span data-start="602.5" data-end="606.67">to fixing the bug for you</span> <span data-start="606.68" data-end="607.91">so I'm going to talk to you a little bit</span> <span data-start="607.91" data-end="615.499">about test cases ten years ago before I</span> <span data-start="615.499" data-end="617.24">got started in this web platform stuff</span> <span data-start="617.24" data-end="620.3">all of the browser's had their own test</span> <span data-start="620.3" data-end="624.29">sets that only ran on their own browser</span> <span data-start="624.29" data-end="628.36">and there was no sharing of tests and</span> <span data-start="628.36" data-end="631.309">over the last 10 years there's been this</span> <span data-start="631.309" data-end="633.86">thing that is now called the web</span> <span data-start="633.86" data-end="638.839">platform tests project that is a</span> <span data-start="638.839" data-end="642.62">repository of cross cross browser tests</span> <span data-start="642.62" data-end="644.689">that the browser's are now all sharing</span> <span data-start="644.689" data-end="650.389">and so if browser developer on Firefox</span> <span data-start="650.389" data-end="652.759">writes a cross browser test they can</span> <span data-start="652.759" data-end="655.309">upload it to web platform tests and that</span> <span data-start="655.309" data-end="657.8">test gets synced to all of the other</span> <span data-start="657.8" data-end="661.189">browsers that are sharing and so it's a</span> <span data-start="661.189" data-end="664.97">multiplier effect and somebody who</span> <span data-start="664.97" data-end="667.189">doesn't work on a browser can add a bug</span> <span data-start="667.189" data-end="670.879">to this repository and it will get moved</span> <span data-start="670.879" data-end="673.73">out to all of the browsers testing</span> <span data-start="673.73" data-end="677.319">environments and be tested in perpetuity</span> <span data-start="677.319" data-end="680.93">using some shared infrastructure that</span> <span data-start="680.93" data-end="685.66">they have been working on together and</span> <span data-start="685.66" data-end="688.879">the set of tests are run independently</span> <span data-start="688.879"
