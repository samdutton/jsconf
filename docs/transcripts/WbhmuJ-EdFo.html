<p><span data-start="314.18" data-end="316.81">API where we can like draws the things</span> <span data-start="316.81" data-end="319.46">then we're going to define interval</span> <span data-start="319.46" data-end="323.319">handler where we like call a function</span> <span data-start="323.319" data-end="330.199">every every 30 / no times per second</span> <span data-start="330.199" data-end="333.56">yeah 70 sounds a second and we're going</span> <span data-start="333.56" data-end="337.31">to clear the canvas with with a fixed</span> <span data-start="337.31" data-end="339.86">width and the fixed wide and then we're</span> <span data-start="339.86" data-end="341.81">going to set the context like we have</span> <span data-start="341.81" data-end="343.4">like some particles we define some</span> <span data-start="343.4" data-end="346.009">objects and we fill them with a</span> <span data-start="346.009" data-end="348.349">particular

data-start="357.469" data-end="359.96">movement so if you click your mouse then</span> <span data-start="359.96" data-end="361.909">they're going to move move there and all</span> <span data-start="361.909" data-end="364.129">that computation where you want to move</span> <span data-start="364.129" data-end="365.93">them what do you want to do you have to</span> <span data-start="365.93" data-end="369.59">do it manually you have to compute it by</span> <span data-start="369.59" data-end="377.77">yourself yeah so basically um I just</span> <span data-start="377.77" data-end="382.19">shortcut through the because I wanted to</span> <span data-start="382.19" data-end="385.25">show you I think now that the internet</span> <span data-start="385.25" data-end="386.599">is working it would be pretty rare to</span> <span data-start="386.599" data-end="389.719">show you the initial demo how about this</span> <span data-start="389.719" data-end="392.21">off I all session click the Sun City far</span> <span data-start="392.21" data-end="399.49">away</span> <span data-start="399.5" data-end="402.34">we had that one</span> <span data-start="402.34" data-end="404.12">you</span> <span data-start="404.12" data-end="407.81">there it is</span> <span data-start="407.82" data-end="410.53">so actually that was our first</span> <span data-start="410.53" data-end="414.25">experience with canvas you know it's</span> <span data-start="414.25" data-end="419.68">like getting data from Twitter like</span> <span data-start="419.68" data-end="422.56">tweets containing the word html5 then we</span> <span data-start="422.56" data-end="425.02">kind of visualize those on the black</span> <span data-start="425.02" data-end="428.14">background and do these random kind of</span> <span data-start="428.14" data-end="431.26">movements and actually that was that</span> <span data-start="431.26" data-end="433.48">became quite popular which kind of made</span> <span data-start="433.48" data-end="434.92">us go further than to that direction</span> <span data-start="434.92" data-end="436.9">because it's quite a lot of fun to do</span> <span data-start="436.9" data-end="442.15">animations using that stuff so let's go</span> <span data-start="442.15" data-end="446.89">back to the presentation so did like</span> <span data-start="446.89" data-end="448.42">there's another important thing if you</span> <span data-start="448.42" data-end="451.9">if you do like drawing on the on the web</span> <span data-start="451.9" data-end="455.77">so what about interaction so you cannot</span> <span data-start="455.77" data-end="459.13">like bind click handlers to elements in</span> <span data-start="459.13" data-end="461.53">the canvas because there are no Dom</span> <span data-start="461.53" data-end="463.12">elements in a canvas you are drawing</span> <span data-start="463.12" data-end="465.16">everything manually so what you actually</span> <span data-start="465.16" data-end="467.86">have to do is you get the XY position</span> <span data-start="467.86" data-end="470.13">from click events and then you have to</span> <span data-start="470.13" data-end="473.5">calculate kind of which element has been</span> <span data-start="473.5" data-end="477.34">clicked by yourself so that's that's</span> <span data-start="477.34" data-end="479.35">kind of tedious sometimes but if you do</span> <span data-start="479.35" data-end="481.24">it right it should work just as well and</span> <span data-start="481.24" data-end="483.31">actually there are libraries which</span> <span data-start="483.31" data-end="486.07">simplify that task so if you want to go</span> <span data-start="486.07" data-end="488.26">into canvas I recommend checking those</span> <span data-start="488.26" data-end="493.18">two out so the cool thing about canvas</span> <span data-start="493.18" data-end="495.34">is it's very flexible you have you can</span> <span data-start="495.34" data-end="498.85">do pixel level manipulations and it's</span> <span data-start="498.85" data-end="501.85">very fast for some some things and if</span> <span data-start="501.85" data-end="503.95">you if you draw something later on you</span> <span data-start="503.95" data-end="506.26">can just export it to an image and store</span> <span data-start="506.26" data-end="509.56">it and it also got some drawbacks</span> <span data-start="509.56" data-end="511.72">actually is resolution dependent because</span> <span data-start="511.72" data-end="514.03">you're always pushing pixel values so</span> <span data-start="514.03" data-end="515.919">unless you're using a framework where</span> <span data-start="515.919" data-end="519.94">you kind of have a way to multiply well</span> <span data-start="519.94" data-end="522.82">use into a bigger or smaller space you</span> <span data-start="522.82" data-end="524.92">are going you might have a problem but</span> <span data-start="524.92" data-end="526.36">actually if you scale up a canvass you</span> <span data-start="526.36" data-end="529.66">get this nice pixel retro effect and I</span> <span data-start="529.66" data-end="533.62">think yeah we have some some demos that</span> <span data-start="533.62" data-end="536.88">you already seen we have another one</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="536.88" data-end="540.45">Roger click here which we implemented</span> <span data-start="540.45" data-end="542.94">for a client who who has to visualize</span> <span data-start="542.94" data-end="544.86">communication between computer knots and</span> <span data-start="544.86" data-end="547.86">we were like thinking in the first place</span> <span data-start="547.86" data-end="550.17">if we do in with canvas or if we do it</span> <span data-start="550.17" data-end="552.9">with SVG and the task for the client was</span> <span data-start="552.9" data-end="555.21">like to create an visualization which</span> <span data-start="555.21" data-end="558.9">can handle up to 5000 notes and with SVG</span> <span data-start="558.9" data-end="562.02">it will be pretty pretty slow so we've</span> <span data-start="562.02" data-end="564.87">chosen canvas which is slow as well but</span> <span data-start="564.87" data-end="567.15">it's acceptable and we created that map</span> <span data-start="567.15" data-end="569.7">where you can can zoom in zoom out and</span> <span data-start="569.7" data-end="572.37">you can see if a node is online offline</span> <span data-start="572.37" data-end="576.14">you can click and as Jeff unset like</span> <span data-start="576.14" data-end="578.61">it's very most very tedious work to</span> <span data-start="578.61" data-end="580.91">create all the event listeners</span> <span data-start="580.91" data-end="584.16">introduced manually I mean basically if</span> <span data-start="584.16" data-end="586.2">you so what you're what you've just seen</span> <span data-start="586.2" data-end="587.79">is like hover effect so you have to</span> <span data-start="587.79" data-end="590.34">recalculate whether your mouse position</span> <span data-start="590.34" data-end="592.53">is on top of some object in your canvas</span> <span data-start="592.53" data-end="594.48">and when you click you have to do the</span> <span data-start="594.48" data-end="597.3">same thing okay this is another demo you</span> <span data-start="597.3" data-end="601.08">just you can draw shapes with canvas</span> <span data-start="601.08" data-end="603.36">like rectangles or circles but you can</span> <span data-start="603.36" data-end="606.75">do draw images or whatever bitmaps as</span> <span data-start="606.75" data-end="610.44">well and we created some some nice</span> <span data-start="610.44" data-end="612.63">control which is not like when you see</span> <span data-start="612.63" data-end="614.58">it you see okay this is flash but it's</span> <span data-start="614.58" data-end="617">more flashes canvas and you can click</span> <span data-start="617" data-end="619.68">images as well and you can highlight</span> <span data-start="619.68" data-end="621.45">similar results and they're going to be</span> <span data-start="621.45" data-end="623.73">focused and all those computations are</span> <span data-start="623.73" data-end="626.97">done manually this is downside but i</span> <span data-start="626.97" data-end="629.28">think the performances is pretty good</span> <span data-start="629.28" data-end="631.29">it's pretty comparable what you what you</span> <span data-start="631.29" data-end="637.08">can do with flash right now okay let's</span> <span data-start="637.08" data-end="640.62">come to the to the second technique to</span> <span data-start="640.62" data-end="643.14">two graphics which is a scalable vector</span> <span data-start="643.14" data-end="646.32">graphics test as we also mentioned is</span> <span data-start="646.32" data-end="649.11">the problem is that canvases resolution</span> <span data-start="649.11" data-end="651.06">dependent so if you take your browser</span> <span data-start="651.06" data-end="653.28">and you're going to zoom in the images</span> <span data-start="653.28" data-end="657.9">get very blurry so with SVG you don't</span> <span data-start="657.9" data-end="664.56">have that problem you have that and if</span> <span data-start="664.56" data-end="667.23">you if you're going to zoom in there it</span> <span data-start="667.23" data-end="669.36">doesn't get blurry at all because it's</span> <span data-start="669.36" data-end="674.85">vectors and so how do you do it SVG is</span> <span data-start="674.85" data-end="679.32">an xml substandard and it's a language</span> <span data-start="679.32" data-end="682.47">to define two-dimensional graphics take</span> <span data-start="682.47" data-end="685.95">it in a declarative way you can do as</span> <span data-start="685.95" data-end="689.07">well filters animations or even sounds</span> <span data-start="689.07" data-end="692.16">and one of the cool things is that is</span> <span data-start="692.16" data-end="695.85">its dom based so this is an example how</span> <span data-start="695.85" data-end="700.769">to draw a circle on a surface you see</span> <span data-start="700.769" data-end="703.44">the xml element for a circle the SVG</span> <span data-start="703.44" data-end="706.35">container and you see some attributes</span> <span data-start="706.35" data-end="710.22">like CX CY for Santa extent of Y R</span> <span data-start="710.22" data-end="711.899">stands for radios you have a fill color</span> <span data-start="711.899" data-end="714.899">and a stroke are you familiar what's</span> <span data-start="714.899" data-end="719.64">with Phil and strokes what it is ok this</span> <span data-start="719.64" data-end="722.82">is a more complex example where we're</span> <span data-start="722.82" data-end="726.149">going to define a gradient in in the SVG</span> <span data-start="726.149" data-end="728.22">definitions and then we're going to draw</span> <span data-start="728.22" data-end="732.029">an ellipse and animate the attributes in</span> <span data-start="732.029" data-end="734.67">it you can define the attribute the</span> <span data-start="734.67" data-end="738.149">animations natively with it but it's</span> <span data-start="738.149" data-end="740.19">rather complicated to do with Aneesa Mel</span> <span data-start="740.19" data-end="742.05">it's not it doesn't feel very yeah I</span> <span data-start="742.05" data-end="743.91">think it's tedious it's like you want to</span> <span data-start="743.91" data-end="745.89">say too and you say one plus one minus</span> <span data-start="745.89" data-end="747.839">one plus one minus one plus one to get</span> <span data-start="747.839" data-end="750.6">to two it's like very much noise very</span> <span data-start="750.6" data-end="753.81">little information so yeah you know I</span> <span data-start="753.81" data-end="756.149">think you know that yeah this is the</span> <span data-start="756.149" data-end="759.69">report from the nokogiri documentation</span> <span data-start="759.69" data-end="761.88">which is an XML parser it says like XML</span> <span data-start="761.88" data-end="763.829">is like violence but if it does not</span> <span data-start="763.829" data-end="765.3">solve your problems you don't use enough</span> <span data-start="765.3" data-end="770.339">of it luckily there's a very very nice</span> <span data-start="770.339" data-end="772.05">javascript library which is called</span> <span data-start="772.05" data-end="775.529">rafael des and this is the point where</span> <span data-start="775.529" data-end="779.13">javascript comes in it abstracts the</span> <span data-start="779.13" data-end="781.92">whole XML to nice JavaScript functions</span> <span data-start="781.92" data-end="784.589">where you just say circle or rectangle</span> <span data-start="784.589" data-end="787.38">and you can put as many objects as you</span> <span data-start="787.38" data-end="791.67">want on a on a paper which is equivalent</span> <span data-start="791.67" data-end="795.42">the SVG equivalent to canvas and it has</span> <span data-start="795.42" data-end="797.819">also some very cool animation functions</span> <span data-start="797.819" data-end="801.149">and it has also a vmail for fall back</span> <span data-start="801.149" data-end="802.2">for the internets</span> <span data-start="802.2" data-end="806.04">and it really works in the in the really</span> <span data-start="806.04" data-end="809.86">filthy process if you know what I mean</span> <span data-start="809.87" data-end="812.91">interaction with SVG is pretty easy you</span> <span data-start="812.91" data-end="814.41">can use the browser's native</span> <span data-start="814.41" data-end="819.21">capabilities because XML SVG is XML and</span> <span data-start="819.21" data-end="821.4">it it lifts in the dome you're going to</span> <span data-start="821.4" data-end="824.52">add an ID to your to your XML elements</span> <span data-start="824.52" data-end="826.32">and you say get element by ID and your</span> <span data-start="826.32" data-end="828.84">add an event listener for click for</span> <span data-start="828.84" data-end="830.82">mouse over or whatever and you have</span> <span data-start="830.82" data-end="834.84">basic interaction this is pretty easy so</span> <span data-start="834.84" data-end="837.93">the pros for refugee is that is reducing</span> <span data-start="837.93" data-end="840.6">resolution independent event handling is</span> <span data-start="840.6" data-end="843.69">a piece of cake and since it 6 ml you</span> <span data-start="843.69" data-end="846.12">can also spice it with Aria attributes</span> <span data-start="846.12" data-end="851.07">to medic made it accessible but you</span> <span data-start="851.07" data-end="853.44">can't do any pixel manipulation with</span> <span data-start="853.44" data-end="855.93">this a few if you want to display many</span> <span data-start="855.93" data-end="857.79">objects many pixels or you want to</span> <span data-start="857.79" data-end="859.83">transform something from color image to</span> <span data-start="859.83" data-end="862.64">grayscale image then SVG is not for you</span> <span data-start="862.64" data-end="865.38">usually it's slower than canvas canvas</span> <span data-start="865.38" data-end="868.44">this really depends them on the on the</span> <span data-start="868.44" data-end="871.59">browser implementation and it definitely</span> <span data-start="871.59" data-end="874.29">needs Rafael for if you like want to</span> <span data-start="874.29" data-end="880.05">support all all browsers we use it in a</span> <span data-start="880.05" data-end="883.23">client's work where the the goal has to</span> <span data-start="883.23" data-end="885.9">be to create something which which works</span> <span data-start="885.9" data-end="892.17">in most browsers and almost this stuff</span> <span data-start="892.17" data-end="894.69">you can see here the pie chart is done</span> <span data-start="894.69" data-end="897.62">you can like create some shares and you</span> <span data-start="897.62" data-end="900.18">can have some funding round for your</span> <span data-start="900.18" data-end="904.05">startup and sit in Rafael yeah actually</span> <span data-start="904.05" data-end="906.72">it's done with Raphael a giraffe I'll</span> <span data-start="906.72" data-end="909.15">ride yes it's a plugin on top of rough</span> <span data-start="909.15" data-end="912.87">l0l where we have like very nice</span> <span data-start="912.87" data-end="915.06">interactions and even this little icons</span> <span data-start="915.06" data-end="916.83">here are done with with rivera as well</span> <span data-start="916.83" data-end="920.84">so they scale very nice it's pretty cool</span> <span data-start="920.84" data-end="927.18">so</span> <span data-start="927.19" data-end="930.56">so another example we really like those</span> <span data-start="930.56" data-end="933.65">dots and yeah it's your company with the</span> <span data-start="933.65" data-end="936.2">dots over yeah lighting the way we</span> <span data-start="936.2" data-end="943.3">decided to stick with that so yeah so I</span> <span data-start="943.3" data-end="946.58">think the what kind of emerged is the</span> <span data-start="946.58" data-end="949.01">most awesome way to do animations in the</span> <span data-start="949.01" data-end="955.55">last year or so is css3 so I don't know</span> <span data-start="955.55" data-end="957.35">if you know this side I mean it has</span> <span data-start="957.35" data-end="961.75">nothing to do with animations but I</span> <span data-start="961.75" data-end="965.15">think that's a lot of box shadow you see</span> <span data-start="965.15" data-end="970.04">a glow so those rays are glowing so if</span> <span data-start="970.04" data-end="972.41">you if you're trying to do animations on</span> <span data-start="972.41" data-end="974.93">this thing so here basically those are</span> <span data-start="974.93" data-end="978.44">all lives those are all lives with box</span> <span data-start="978.44" data-end="980.33">shadow and they are rapke transformed</span> <span data-start="980.33" data-end="983.72">into place so if you animate them no</span> <span data-start="983.72" data-end="985.94">matter the browser it doesn't work</span> <span data-start="985.94" data-end="988.46">because it's so much not hardware</span> <span data-start="988.46" data-end="990.8">accelerated filter stuff going on</span> <span data-start="990.8" data-end="993.47">there's no way you can get above 1 FPS</span> <span data-start="993.47" data-end="1000.07">or something so yeah so we implemented</span> <span data-start="1000.07" data-end="1003.85">the same thing again and actually it</span> <span data-start="1003.85" data-end="1008.05">runs not that fast in chrome because</span> <span data-start="1008.05" data-end="1009.85">chrome is not hardware accelerated but</span> <span data-start="1009.85" data-end="1012.22">if you run it in safari on iphone the</span> <span data-start="1012.22" data-end="1014.26">ipad you can run it and so far here but</span> <span data-start="1014.26" data-end="1016.99">we go no yeah maybe this is what we're</span> <span data-start="1016.99" data-end="1018.43">going to show you on the iPads like we</span> <span data-start="1018.43" data-end="1020.23">implemented the whole three dot thing</span> <span data-start="1020.23" data-end="1021.58">you're going to release it after the</span> <span data-start="1021.58" data-end="1024.339">talk on github so you can see the source</span> <span data-start="1024.339" data-end="1026.5">code for yourself and we implemented the</span> <span data-start="1026.5" data-end="1028.15">first thing in canvas which is pretty</span> <span data-start="1028.15" data-end="1031.179">slow on the iPad it works but it's it</span> <span data-start="1031.179" data-end="1034.42">looks it does not look so nice we have a</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1034.42" data-end="1038.079">SVG version which is slight far sir but</span> <span data-start="1038.079" data-end="1041.819">not that fast as well and we have a</span> <span data-start="1041.819" data-end="1044.439">hidden champion at that point it's like</span> <span data-start="1044.439" data-end="1047.29">a version with CSS transitions and these</span> <span data-start="1047.29" data-end="1049.69">are almost like run at full frame rate</span> <span data-start="1049.69" data-end="1053.08">so it's very very interesting things to</span> <span data-start="1053.08" data-end="1056.2">use to use and abuse CSS transitions to</span> <span data-start="1056.2" data-end="1057.68">create animations</span> <span data-start="1057.68" data-end="1062.16">so quickly pick a quick recap again so</span> <span data-start="1062.16" data-end="1064.65">how do you do effects how can you move</span> <span data-start="1064.65" data-end="1068.22">elements and transformed and oh actually</span> <span data-start="1068.22" data-end="1069.57">that is the process a WebKit transform</span> <span data-start="1069.57" data-end="1072.84">sorry so and the second thing how do you</span> <span data-start="1072.84" data-end="1074.7">and how do you do animations well you</span> <span data-start="1074.7" data-end="1076.26">use the transition or the animation</span> <span data-start="1076.26" data-end="1079.83">attributes so just a very quick recap</span> <span data-start="1079.83" data-end="1082.53">you have like these four parameter value</span> <span data-start="1082.53" data-end="1084.51">to set where you say which value you</span> <span data-start="1084.51" data-end="1089.52">want to animate for how long given a</span> <span data-start="1089.52" data-end="1092.4">timing function so there's an extra</span> <span data-start="1092.4" data-end="1094.86">slide for that in a second and you can</span> <span data-start="1094.86" data-end="1096.81">like set an initial delay so if you want</span> <span data-start="1096.81" data-end="1098.97">to delay it transition or an animation</span> <span data-start="1098.97" data-end="1106.38">you can do that so timing yeah we dig a</span> <span data-start="1106.38" data-end="1108.06">little into into some timing functions</span> <span data-start="1108.06" data-end="1111.09">if you do animations you can do you have</span> <span data-start="1111.09" data-end="1113.49">several possibilities possibilities to</span> <span data-start="1113.49" data-end="1117">add a tyrant function its linear is is</span> <span data-start="1117" data-end="1119.82">in is out is an out and cubic z function</span> <span data-start="1119.82" data-end="1123.27">and we try to explain it visionless like</span> <span data-start="1123.27" data-end="1126.45">move the object from a to be at the in</span> <span data-start="1126.45" data-end="1128.64">the same same time with the same</span> <span data-start="1128.64" data-end="1132.39">velocity easing means start with the</span> <span data-start="1132.39" data-end="1137.34">higher velocity and and then do</span> <span data-start="1137.34" data-end="1141.03">celebrate decelerate in the end even is</span> <span data-start="1141.03" data-end="1143.19">it decelerates in the beginning and then</span> <span data-start="1143.19" data-end="1146.43">gets faster is out is the same like ease</span> <span data-start="1146.43" data-end="1149.07">ease it out is like having balls</span> <span data-start="1149.07" data-end="1150.96">deceleration in the beginning in the end</span> <span data-start="1150.96" data-end="1153.87">and cubic busy is the possibility to add</span> <span data-start="1153.87" data-end="1156.54">your own spline function to have like</span> <span data-start="1156.54" data-end="1158.52">like a bounce or something you can</span> <span data-start="1158.52" data-end="1160.92">create very interesting stuff with this</span> <span data-start="1160.92" data-end="1171.05">one yeah so basically you have for for</span> <span data-start="1171.05" data-end="1173.43">transform up operations you can push</span> <span data-start="1173.43" data-end="1176.04">into most browsers so you can translate</span> <span data-start="1176.04" data-end="1178.32">stuff which means moving it you can</span> <span data-start="1178.32" data-end="1181.65">scale it you can rotate it and there's</span> <span data-start="1181.65" data-end="1184.17">this nice metrics attribute where you</span> <span data-start="1184.17" data-end="1186.57">can basically you can feed it your own</span> <span data-start="1186.57" data-end="1189.24">metrics which might be pre-calculated</span> <span data-start="1189.24" data-end="1190">which my</span> <span data-start="1190" data-end="1192.13">come from a native iphone clients so</span> <span data-start="1192.13" data-end="1196.84">diamond mo coming up so and what makes</span> <span data-start="1196.84" data-end="1199.15">so css3 animations super useful well we</span> <span data-start="1199.15" data-end="1202.21">already said it so the problem with</span> <span data-start="1202.21" data-end="1204.28">canvas and SVG is it's not hardware</span> <span data-start="1204.28" data-end="1207.28">accelerated in most devices I think by</span> <span data-start="1207.28" data-end="1209.5">now I 9 is the only browser accelerating</span> <span data-start="1209.5" data-end="1213.7">canvas it's a true know which one it was</span> <span data-start="1213.7" data-end="1220.67">well Mozilla yeah for that's awesome so</span> <span data-start="1220.68" data-end="1225.4">well and of course interaction is also</span> <span data-start="1225.4" data-end="1227.65">native because you just animate Dom</span> <span data-start="1227.65" data-end="1234.37">elements and old story so okay on iOS it</span> <span data-start="1234.37" data-end="1237.91">is super powers but on androids little</span> <span data-start="1237.91" data-end="1240.46">sets like all the nice transitions you</span> <span data-start="1240.46" data-end="1243.1">do on iphone which one like at full</span> <span data-start="1243.1" data-end="1246.01">frame rate they look they don't run a</span> <span data-start="1246.01" data-end="1248.31">full frame rate on Android sadly and</span> <span data-start="1248.31" data-end="1251.11">unknown WebKit it looks more like this</span> <span data-start="1251.11" data-end="1255.72">yeah luckily Firefox 4 implements</span> <span data-start="1255.72" data-end="1258.4">transitions funny thing if you do a</span> <span data-start="1258.4" data-end="1262.83">translation of an object and Firefox for</span> <span data-start="1262.83" data-end="1267.1">its slower to do it with with with the</span> <span data-start="1267.1" data-end="1269.95">transform properties with the matrix and</span> <span data-start="1269.95" data-end="1272.47">transitions rather than set your own set</span> <span data-start="1272.47" data-end="1274.96">interval and use margin-top and margin</span> <span data-start="1274.96" data-end="1278.35">left but they implemented it and they're</span> <span data-start="1278.35" data-end="1280.18">going to improve it and one day it's</span> <span data-start="1280.18" data-end="1281.59">going to be fast enough to do everything</span> <span data-start="1281.59" data-end="1286.12">you want to do with this okay so I'll</span> <span data-start="1286.12" data-end="1290.7">basically put to wrap it up a little and</span> <span data-start="1290.7" data-end="1293.08">you have to decide which one you're</span> <span data-start="1293.08" data-end="1294.7">going to use to solve your problem and</span> <span data-start="1294.7" data-end="1298.27">there is no best solution but here's</span> <span data-start="1298.27" data-end="1301.6">some advice so you kind of know when you</span> <span data-start="1301.6" data-end="1302.56">have to solve your problem you think</span> <span data-start="1302.56" data-end="1305.11">about okay does it run on mobile does it</span> <span data-start="1305.11" data-end="1311.26">run on on the desktop so that's a white</span> <span data-start="1311.26" data-end="1312.61">rule of thumb if you go mobile you</span> <span data-start="1312.61" data-end="1315.1">should go for css3 transitions and stuff</span> <span data-start="1315.1" data-end="1316.39">like that because that works really</span> <span data-start="1316.39" data-end="1319.78">really well you also have like when an</span> <span data-start="1319.78" data-end="1320.669">animation or if</span> <span data-start="1320.669" data-end="1324.119">addition is finished you get WebKit you</span> <span data-start="1324.119" data-end="1326.19">get Tommy whence being fired so you can</span> <span data-start="1326.19" data-end="1328.679">change or gather animations it's a bit</span> <span data-start="1328.679" data-end="1330.389">limited at the moment but it's working</span> <span data-start="1330.389" data-end="1338.369">quite alright and yeah so yeah so first</span> <span data-start="1338.369" data-end="1339.929">you look at the device and then you look</span> <span data-start="1339.929" data-end="1341.759">at the problem you're trying to
