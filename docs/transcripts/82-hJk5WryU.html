so</span> <span data-start="259.359" data-end="261.13">that was sort of the beginning of my</span> <span data-start="261.13" data-end="263.11">thinking on the subject introduced</span> <span data-start="263.11" data-end="267.28">myself and so that's one thing just kind</span> <span data-start="267.28" data-end="268.78">of keep this in mind as we as we go</span> <span data-start="268.78" data-end="272.289">along this is the start of that another</span> <span data-start="272.289" data-end="274.99">project that I worked on was evil packet</span> <span data-start="274.99" data-end="277.87">net and I thought I was reporting these</span> <span data-start="277.87" data-end="280.21">web vulnerabilities to to builders to</span> <span data-start="280.21" data-end="284.08">developers to projects and you know I</span> <span data-start="284.08" data-end="286.81">was getting like nobody cared nobody's</span> <span data-start="286.81" data-end="289.81">responded respond might fix it and I</span> <span data-start="289.81" data-end="293.68">thought maybe maybe that understanding</span> <span data-start="293.68" data-end="295.24">was founded in not or that</span> <span data-start="295.24" data-end="298.69">misunderstanding was was founded in they</span> <span data-start="298.69" data-end="300.25">didn't understand the impact

<span data-start="305.05" data-end="308.289">right and turns out that's that's that's</span> <span data-start="308.289" data-end="311.8">wrong and it's sort of like end up being</span> <span data-start="311.8" data-end="314.139">so when I look back on it it was</span> <span data-start="314.139" data-end="316">effective in getting things fixed and</span> <span data-start="316" data-end="319.36">sir sure some people did learn some</span> <span data-start="319.36" data-end="323.919">things about vulnerabilities and</span> <span data-start="323.919" data-end="325.96">exploits and whatever</span> <span data-start="325.96" data-end="328.539">but it was a very negative way to do it</span> <span data-start="328.539" data-end="330.31">and I'm going to talk specifically about</span> <span data-start="330.31" data-end="333.46">some of those in a minute just kind of</span> <span data-start="333.46" data-end="337.949">keep keep these in mind as we as we go</span> </p>

data-start="343.3" data-end="348.16">in as a as a breaker I thought it was a</span> <span data-start="348.16" data-end="351.43">great idea to start going to developer</span> <span data-start="351.43" data-end="354.789">conferences you guys see I said it right</span> <span data-start="354.789" data-end="359.139">there Builders are my audience right</span> <span data-start="359.139" data-end="360.91">from a security perspective I want to</span> <span data-start="360.91" data-end="365.229">talk to you it's really hard for me not</span> <span data-start="365.229" data-end="367.539">say to you guys and separate myself so</span> <span data-start="367.539" data-end="372.669">at JS conf in Portland Ryan gave me the</span> <span data-start="372.669" data-end="374.169">feedback during my talk I kept saying</span> <span data-start="374.169" data-end="377.44">you guys this you guys that point point</span> <span data-start="377.44" data-end="381.07">point you know rant rant rant typical</span> <span data-start="381.07" data-end="385.449">breaker mindset and yeah I was giving</span> <span data-start="385.449" data-end="388.15">very direct feedback like you know I</span> <span data-start="388.15" data-end="389.289">don't remember the exact sweet i</span> <span data-start="389.289" data-end="391.9">couldn't find it but it was something</span> <span data-start="391.9" data-end="393.699">you know something of the you know this</span> <span data-start="393.699" data-end="395.71">guy's saying you guys like a lot like</span> <span data-start="395.71" data-end="399.099">stop and its really really really</span> <span data-start="399.099" data-end="402.009">impacted my thing like those two words</span> <span data-start="402.009" data-end="403.84">and that feedback I don't think you</span> <span data-start="403.84" data-end="405.789">realize how just how much it's had an</span> <span data-start="405.789" data-end="409.87">impact on my on my thinking about the</span> <span data-start="409.87" data-end="411.31">interaction between the two communities</span> <span data-start="411.31" data-end="414.969">and when you're speaking if you as a</span> <span data-start="414.969" data-end="416.77">builder the developer if you're going to</span> <span data-start="416.77" data-end="420.009">go speak at a security event remember be</span> <span data-start="420.009" data-end="421.539">a part of that community because because</span> <span data-start="421.539" data-end="424.15">you are we really are we really have a</span> <span data-start="424.15" data-end="426.759">limit like relationship that that is</span> <span data-start="426.759" data-end="429.039">very dependent on each other don't</span> <span data-start="429.039" data-end="431.289">alienate yourself like I did like don't</span> <span data-start="431.289" data-end="433.84">it was just I missed a huge opportunity</span> <span data-start="433.84" data-end="435.34">to connect with people and get my</span> <span data-start="435.34" data-end="437.949">message across because I just put up</span> <span data-start="437.949" data-end="440.469">that wall I'm an outsider looking in I'm</span> <span data-start="440.469" data-end="441.969">not you know I'm just saying blah blah</span> <span data-start="441.969" data-end="446.65">rant so again keep that in mind and</span> <span data-start="446.65" data-end="450.61">thank you so it's still a little bit of</span> <span data-start="450.61" data-end="454.289">a story about a specific organization</span> <span data-start="454.289" data-end="458.05">that will kind of demonstrate some of</span> <span data-start="458.05" data-end="459.46">the things that I'm talking about</span> <span data-start="459.46" data-end="462.41">basecamp classic 37signals was the I</span> <span data-start="462.41" data-end="464.54">found a vulnerability in base camp in</span> <span data-start="464.54" data-end="466.37">which you could take over any

data-start="471.95" data-end="476.37">video i published an evil packet and</span> <span data-start="476.38" data-end="478.88">during that process i contacted support</span> <span data-start="478.88" data-end="482.3">and I wrote him a nice email I don't I</span> <span data-start="482.3" data-end="485.12">try to look at if I didn't have it and I</span> <span data-start="485.12" data-end="487.22">basically said here's the problem I got</span> <span data-start="487.22" data-end="488.39">a response back from the support and</span> <span data-start="488.39" data-end="492.41">said basically you know our clients like</span> <span data-start="492.41" data-end="493.46">to be able to do this like to be put</span> <span data-start="493.46" data-end="495.23">javascript in the pages and whatever and</span> <span data-start="495.23" data-end="497.87">basically what they said is that it's a</span> <span data-start="497.87" data-end="503.45">feature and this is was my answer</span> <span data-start="503.45" data-end="504.56">cross-site scripting is not a feature</span> <span data-start="504.56" data-end="507.65">and i made a video about it and put it</span> <span data-start="507.65" data-end="510.23">on the internet and they got raked over</span> <span data-start="510.23" data-end="515.62">the coals in hindsight feeling wise i</span> <span data-start="515.62" data-end="521.81">felt a terrible for what what was being</span> <span data-start="521.81" data-end="525.74">what what was going on there but we'll</span> <span data-start="525.74" data-end="530.39">get to it now feelings so let's let's</span> <span data-start="530.39" data-end="533.81">talk about what's happening during both</span> <span data-start="533.81" data-end="537.08">on both sides when when these things are</span> <span data-start="537.08" data-end="541.13">reported so you know imagine yourself as</span> <span data-start="541.13" data-end="543.95">as the developer as the builder in this</span> <span data-start="543.95" data-end="546.71">scenario I want you to really think hard</span> <span
