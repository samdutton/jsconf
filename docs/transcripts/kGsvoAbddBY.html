data-end="330.36">hotness Oh angular yeah yeah react yeah</span> <span data-start="330.36" data-end="333.059">and it's just this it's like a fashion</span> <span data-start="333.059" data-end="335.879">trend it's like man is it is this actual</span> <span data-start="335.879" data-end="337.919">progress or is it just changes in</span> <span data-start="337.919"

data-end="343.979">frustrating because like you know you</span> <span data-start="343.979" data-end="345.659">start at one of these years in the past</span> <span data-start="345.659" data-end="347.309">year and you've seen this all in your</span> <span data-start="347.309" data-end="349.229">kind of like okay I've been through this</span> <span data-start="349.229" data-end="351.959">before like why am I even learning this</span> <span data-start="351.959" data-end="353.309">new framework and you kind of get pissed</span> <span data-start="353.309" data-end="354.779">off and that's where the grumpy</span> <span data-start="354.779" data-end="357.24">developer sort of comes in you want to</span> <span data-start="357.24" data-end="360.209">avoid that so yeah this is part of my</span> <span data-start="360.209" data-end="362.61">perspective this is like okay how can I</span> <span data-start="362.61" data-end="364.74">sort of change my attitude to not be</span> <span data-start="364.74" data-end="366.24">like that to sort of be receptive to</span> <span data-start="366.24" data-end="369.779">this to be able to keep up with it this</span> <span data-start="369.779" data-end="371.699">is her cleitus putting on his developer</span> <span data-start="371.699" data-end="374.18">hat in this case this JavaScript head</span> <span data-start="374.18" data-end="376.86">technology is constantly changing cannot</span> <span data-start="376.86" data-end="379.009">step twice into the same stat tech stack</span> <span

data-end="384.329">constantly changing even the libraries</span> <span data-start="384.329" data-end="386.369">themselves are changing over time we saw</span> <span data-start="386.369" data-end="388.529">that with angular 1 2 angular 2 and now</span> <span data-start="388.529" data-end="390.209">people got all frustrated and you is</span> <span data-start="390.209" data-end="391.8">everything changed like why don't I</span> <span data-start="391.8" data-end="393.509">don't just move to react down you know</span> <span data-start="393.509" data-end="395.269">you know people get frustrated with that</span> <span data-start="395.269" data-end="398.249">this is a something you probably saw Ben</span> <span data-start="398.249" data-end="401.969">nato's blog about angularjs in</span> <span data-start="401.969" data-end="404.189">particular and it's kind of like a</span> <span data-start="404.189" data-end="406.11">optimistic perspective this angular
