you know</span> <span data-start="152.83" data-end="155.29">you can say display grid but only the</span> <span data-start="155.29" data-end="158.08">direct children of the grid become grid</span>

data-end="173.89">implemented by anyone and we sort of</span> <span data-start="173.89" data-end="175.36">changed how maybe that was going to</span> <span data-start="175.36" data-end="177.28">happen and and there was some debate</span> <span data-start="177.28" data-end="179.02">about it and eventually it was removed</span> <span data-start="179.02" data-end="181.48">from the specification from the level</span> <span data-start="181.48" data-end="183.1">one spec so he kind of finished that</span> <span data-start="183.1" data-end="185.65">specification but I was very very keen</span> <span data-start="185.65" data-end="187.69">that this sub grid feature wouldn't go</span> <span data-start="187.69" data-end="190.12">away and as soon as people started using</span> <span

data-end="199.63">is kind of the really good example of</span> <span data-start="199.63" data-end="203.02">why you might need sub grid we've got a</span> <span data-start="203.02" data-end="204.73">pattern like this you've got a set of</span> <span data-start="204.73" data-end="206.769">cards and they've got neat headers and</span> <span data-start="206.769" data-end="209.35">footers I imagine that everyone has had</span> <span data-start="209.35" data-end="211.39">a designer bring to them a design like</span> <span data-start="211.39" data-end="213.73">this with all of the same content in all</span> <span data-start="213.73" data-end="216.19">of the boxes because that's exactly how</span> <span data-start="216.19" data-end="219.04">all websites work we have an identical</span> <span data-start="219.04" data-end="222.04">content in every box all of the time and</span> <span data-start="222.04" data-end="223.9">of course you get it you implement this</span> <span data-start="223.9" data-end="225.4">you say well that's a nice grid layout</span> <span data-start="225.4" data-end="227.38">really easy grid layout like your basic</span> <span data-start="227.38" data-end="229.33">grid example will give you that layout</span> <span data-start="229.33" data-end="231.85">so you build that layout and then you</span> <span data-start="231.85" data-end="235.269">get it into the CMS and this happens and</span> <span data-start="235.269" data-end="238.69">then the designer says no those footers</span> <span data-start="238.69" data-end="240.28">are all supposed to line up with each</span> <span data-start="240.28" data-end="244.57">other and you're like yeah and it's kind</span> <span data-start="244.57" data-end="246.25">of like we've pushed this problem a</span> <span data-start="246.25" data-end="247.63">level deeper because we used to have</span> <span data-start="247.63" data-end="248.769">this problem we had this problem with</span> <span data-start="248.769" data-end="250.06">floats that you couldn't line at the</span> <span data-start="250.06" data-end="252.31">bottom of the boxes and then we got grid</span> <span data-start="252.31" data-end="253.81">and we own flexbox and we could line at</span> <span data-start="253.81" data-end="255.97">the bottom of our boxes but if your</span> <span data-start="255.97" data-end="258.88">boxes are nested inside a grid item even</span> <span data-start="258.88" data-end="261.07">if they are a grid themselves</span> <span data-start="261.07" data-end="262.69">you still can't line at the boxes</span> <span data-start="262.69" data-end="265.45">because they're independent grids and</span> <span data-start="265.45" data-end="267.61">this is a fundamental thing about using</span> <span data-start="267.61" data-end="270.07">the display property values of display</span> <span data-start="270.07" data-end="273.36">don't inherit</span> <span data-start="273.37" data-end="275.98">so the kind of wine back and understand</span> <span data-start="275.98" data-end="279.13">the actual problem CSS has got this</span> <span data-start="279.13" data-end="281.53">concept of normal flow or block and</span> <span data-start="281.53" data-end="283.78">inline layout and that's pretty much the</span> <span data-start="283.78" data-end="285.52">first thing you learn when you learn CSS</span> <span data-start="285.52" data-end="287.919">you've got block things and they kind of</span> <span data-start="287.919" data-end="289.389">spread out and take up all the space and</span> <span data-start="289.389" data-end="291.4">you've got inline things like words and</span> <span data-start="291.4" data-end="292.65">they go next to each other</span> <span data-start="292.65" data-end="296.05">now that's normal flow and it can be</span> <span data-start="296.05" data-end="298.389">worth thinking that essentially CSS is</span> <span data-start="298.389" data-end="300.699">always trying to go back to this layout</span> <span data-start="300.699" data-end="303.31">method so you can change the value of</span> <span data-start="303.31" data-end="305.65">display you can make something display</span> <span data-start="305.65" data-end="307.84">flex you can make something display grid</span> <span data-start="307.84" data-end="310.27">and it's children will become flex or</span> <span data-start="310.27" data-end="312.7">grid items but they're children the</span> <span data-start="312.7" data-end="315.4">internals of those boxes they go right</span> <span data-start="315.4" data-end="318.49">back to normal flow now that's kind of a</span> <span data-start="318.49" data-end="320.29">good thing because otherwise once you</span> <span data-start="320.29" data-end="322.479">said display grid you'd then have to go</span> <span data-start="322.479" data-end="324.49">and say oh you know these things inside</span> <span data-start="324.49" data-end="325.9">our grid items you can't really be</span> <span data-start="325.9" data-end="327.1">setting yourself all the way down</span> <span data-start="327.1" data-end="329.44">because generally normal flow is what</span> <span data-start="329.44" data-end="331.06">you want it means that we can write the</span> <span data-start="331.06" data-end="333.07">page of HTML and just load up in a</span> <span data-start="333.07" data-end="335.38">browser and it's readable you know most</span> <span data-start="335.38" data-end="337.83">the time that's actually what you want</span> <span data-start="337.83" data-end="340.36">so here's a simple flex example we've</span> <span data-start="340.36" data-end="341.8">got a normal flow heading and a</span> <span data-start="341.8" data-end="343.06">paragraph didn't have to do anything</span> <span data-start="343.06" data-end="344.83">about their layout then I've got this</span> <span data-start="344.83" data-end="347.32">meteor object said display flex and the</span> <span data-start="347.32" data-end="349.27">image in the content our Flex items but</span> <span data-start="349.27" data-end="351.13">the content has a heading and some and a</span> <span data-start="351.13" data-end="353.32">paragraph that's gone right back there</span> <span data-start="353.32" data-end="356.26">to normal flow so that's kind of what's</span> <span data-start="356.26" data-end="358.21">happening and that's why we can't just</span> <span data-start="358.21" data-end="360.07">make things the nest is somewhere in the</span> <span data-start="360.07" data-end="364.63">structure participate in the grid our</span> <span data-start="364.63"

data-start="1060.57" data-end="1062.49">and you can sort of see how that works</span> <span data-start="1062.49" data-end="1066.75">here but sometimes you want things to</span> <span data-start="1066.75" data-end="1068.67">line up with a parent tracks but you</span> <span data-start="1068.67" data-end="1070.26">might actually want to say close the gap</span> <span data-start="1070.26" data-end="1071.92">between two items perhaps you've</span> <span data-start="1071.92" data-end="1074.14">you know some content with a box below</span> <span data-start="1074.14" data-end="1075.7">it you don't want to have a visible gap</span> <span data-start="1075.7" data-end="1078.4">between the two things so to enable that</span> <span data-start="1078.4" data-end="1081.75">we can change the gaps on the sub grid</span> <span data-start="1081.75" data-end="1084.13">so you just used the gap properties as</span> <span data-start="1084.13" data-end="1086.11">normal on that sub grid at item so you</span> <span data-start="1086.11" data-end="1088.12">could if you wanted no gap like in this</span> <span data-start="1088.12" data-end="1091.21">example I've said row gap zero setting</span> <span data-start="1091.21" data-end="1093.22">the gap to zero and it's a bit like if</span> <span data-start="1093.22" data-end="1095.71">add as a negative margin then to the</span> <span data-start="1095.71" data-end="1098.38">item so it will sort of get into the gap</span> <span data-start="1098.38" data-end="1100.57">and it won't expand out of the top of</span> <span data-start="1100.57" data-end="1102.13">the there so good that would be really</span> <span data-start="1102.13" data-end="1104.02">weird and not very useful it will just</span> <span data-start="1104.02" data-end="1105.73">go down into any gaps and sort of fill</span> <span data-start="1105.73" data-end="1109.21">in the gap if you had said a larger gap</span> <span data-start="1109.21" data-end="1111.13">than is on the parent but it's as if</span> <span data-start="1111.13" data-end="1112.6">you've added a margin and it will sort</span> <span data-start="1112.6" data-end="1115.3">of you know go in but it's like that the</span> <span data-start="1115.3" data-end="1116.98">line of the grid sort of runs down the</span> <span data-start="1116.98" data-end="1119.95">middle of the gap basically and you can</span> <span data-start="1119.95" data-end="1121.99">sort of get into that by setting the gap</span> <span data-start="1121.99" data-end="1122.95">to zero</span> <span data-start="1122.95" data-end="1130.24">or whatever you want and hopefully it's</span> <span data-start="1130.24" data-end="1131.5">me it's sort of fairly obvious so I'm</span> <span data-start="1131.5" data-end="1133.21">looking at this stuff that sizing of</span> <span data-start="1133.21" data-end="1134.59">items in the sub grid can obviously</span> <span data-start="1134.59" data-end="1137.92">change the size of the parent tracks so</span> <span data-start="1137.92" data-end="1139.96">if you've got a row which is set to auto</span> <span data-start="1139.96" data-end="1142.36">which is the default for for grid tracks</span> <span data-start="1142.36" data-end="1144.4">and you put more and more content and</span> <span data-start="1144.4" data-end="1145.87">that's going to obviously make the sub</span> <span data-start="1145.87" data-end="1148.24">gridded row grow but as long as the</span> <span data-start="1148.24" data-end="1150.82">parent rows is auto that will grow as</span> <span data-start="1150.82" data-end="1153.16">well so it kind of works pretty much as</span> <span data-start="1153.16" data-end="1155.44">you'd expect it works pretty much like</span> <span data-start="1155.44" data-end="1157.84">you've just nested a grid and you happen</span> <span data-start="1157.84" data-end="1159.61">to be using you at the tracks from the</span> <span data-start="1159.61" data-end="1162.55">parent but everything else works in kind</span> <span data-start="1162.55" data-end="1164.11">of the way you'd expect if you've nested</span> <span data-start="1164.11" data-end="1165.88">one grid inside the other or if you've</span> <span data-start="1165.88" data-end="1168.28">already got designs where you're nesting</span> <span data-start="1168.28" data-end="1173.32">one grid inside the other so this is how</span> <span data-start="1173.32" data-end="1175.02">we would get our card example to work</span> <span data-start="1175.02" data-end="1177.73">we'd basically stretch our card over</span> <span data-start="1177.73" data-end="1180.25">three tracks of the grid which means</span> <span data-start="1180.25" data-end="1182.62">that the footers are now all in the same</span> <span data-start="1182.62" data-end="1184.9">row which means they all line up with</span> <span data-start="1184.9" data-end="1186.76">each other and when our footer which is</span> <span data-start="1186.76" data-end="1188.92">taller makes that row bigger it makes</span> <span data-start="1188.92" data-end="1191.08">the whole row bigger and we just get</span> <span data-start="1191.08" data-end="1193.81">space below the items that don't have as</span> <span data-start="1193.81" data-end="1196.21">much content which is really what we</span> <span data-start="1196.21" data-end="1199.39">wanted and we can also remove the gaps</span> <span data-start="1199.39" data-end="1201.58">throw on the parent grid on the child if</span> <span data-start="1201.58" data-end="1203.38">we don't want to have the bigger row gap</span> <span data-start="1203.38" data-end="1204.97">which we have between the</span> <span data-start="1204.97" data-end="1207.73">two items so this is this is pretty cool</span> <span data-start="1207.73" data-end="1209.5">this allows us to create that pattern it</span> <span data-start="1209.5" data-end="1212.17">allows us to nest grids and let them</span> <span data-start="1212.17" data-end="1214.33">then participate in the sizing really of</span> <span data-start="1214.33" data-end="1216.82">the parent and you can do this really as</span> <span data-start="1216.82" data-end="1221.17">far down as you need to do now I've been</span> <span data-start="1221.17" data-end="1222.43">playing around this for a little while</span> <span data-start="1222.43" data-end="1225.04">and just sort of I like to sort of think</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1225.04" data-end="1227.08">Oh will this solve any other problems</span> <span data-start="1227.08" data-end="1228.79">that we've got and because you know this</span> <span data-start="1228.79" data-end="1230.29">is a sort of very obvious use case</span> <span data-start="1230.29" data-end="1231.91">having a set of cards like this this was</span> <span data-start="1231.91" data-end="1233.35">one of the first things that was brought</span> <span data-start="1233.35" data-end="1236.2">to me well why can't we do this there's</span> <span data-start="1236.2" data-end="1237.43">also the example of you know maybe</span> <span data-start="1237.43" data-end="1239.11">having like a 12 column layout and</span> <span data-start="1239.11" data-end="1240.4">wanting things that are nested</span> <span data-start="1240.4" data-end="1242.53">further down in the structure to also</span> <span data-start="1242.53" data-end="1244.54">use that

other things</span> <span data-start="1249.52" data-end="1251.68">that I've started to realize we can do</span> <span data-start="1251.68" data-end="1256.24">because we've got sub grid and yeah this</span> <span data-start="1256.24" data-end="1260.2">is one of them if you use an explicit</span> <span data-start="1260.2" data-end="1262.6">grid so this is where you say grid</span> <span
