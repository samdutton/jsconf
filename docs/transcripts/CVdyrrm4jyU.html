cases</span> <span data-start="235.18" data-end="237.28">for your unit tests for your science</span> <span data-start="237.28" data-end="239.95">code so there's a lot of people with a</span> <span

data-end="246.37">scientists can actually reproduce each</span> <span data-start="246.37" data-end="249.1">other's results because a lot of people</span> <span data-start="249.1"

about is</span> <span data-start="261.51" data-end="263.5">kind of like get but</span> <span data-start="263.5" data-end="268.03">data so source control before get you</span> <span data-start="268.03" data-end="270.82">had did anybody do code before get or</span> <span data-start="270.82" data-end="273.31">like maybe even be for subversion it's</span> <span data-start="273.31" data-end="277.42">uh and uh we used to do that remember</span> <span data-start="277.42" data-end="279.34">they're like you know 4050 years of</span> <span data-start="279.34" data-end="281.92">computing resource control people did it</span> <span data-start="281.92" data-end="284.53">and you know if you had a cool project</span> <span data-start="284.53" data-end="286.9">you want to fix a bug how did you find</span> <span data-start="286.9" data-end="289.09">it you got a zip file or something you</span> <span data-start="289.09" data-end="290.92">unpacked it and you manually edited it</span> <span data-start="290.92" data-end="293.98">and notepad.exe or whoever and you would</span> <span data-start="293.98" data-end="295.6">email the file back to the maintainer</span> <span data-start="295.6" data-end="296.95">and maybe you never heard back it's like</span> <span data-start="296.95" data-end="299.44">a black hole and like the fort number</span> <span data-start="299.44" data-end="301.45">four is actually the most important one</span> <span data-start="301.45" data-end="302.919">like nobody knows what happens after the</span> <span data-start="302.919" data-end="305.59">email back usually the maintainer would</span> <span data-start="305.59" data-end="308.02">like maybe copy paste your code in and</span> <span data-start="308.02" data-end="309.7">make a new zip and there's hope the new</span> <span data-start="309.7" data-end="312.94">zip finds the users as totally just like</span> <span data-start="312.94" data-end="314.95">the most insane there's just like no</span> <span data-start="314.95" data-end="317.02">rhyme or reason and then get came along</span> <span data-start="317.02" data-end="319.65">and get added all these cool verbs that</span> <span data-start="319.65" data-end="322">tracks changes and you could actually</span> <span data-start="322" data-end="324.97">diff and stuff like that but you still</span> <span data-start="324.97" data-end="326.32">had to email that was kind of annoying</span> <span data-start="326.32" data-end="328.15">emailing patch files but hey it was</span> <span data-start="328.15" data-end="329.979">better than nothing and then github came</span> <span data-start="329.979" data-end="331.87">along because get like a few years later</span> <span data-start="331.87" data-end="334.09">and you didn't have to email anymore and</span> <span data-start="334.09" data-end="335.95">this is actually from a collaboration</span> <span data-start="335.95" data-end="338.11">standpoint make email inboxes aren't</span> <span data-start="338.11" data-end="340.419">public so it's really important that if</span> <span data-start="340.419" data-end="342.34">you're about to send a poor quest you</span> <span data-start="342.34" data-end="343.72">can be like wait I should check if</span> <span data-start="343.72" data-end="344.59">there's somebody else that's already</span> <span data-start="344.59" data-end="346.27">sent this for requests that's what</span> <span data-start="346.27" data-end="351.27">github does among other things emoji so</span> <span data-start="351.27" data-end="353.56">with get you can just you don't have to</span> <span data-start="353.56" data-end="355.87">do all those manual steps you can just</span> <span data-start="355.87" data-end="359.44">get pull so our claim our kind of</span> <span data-start="359.44" data-end="360.76">operating premise of the project is that</span> <span data-start="360.76" data-end="362.8">data sharing I mean anyway this worked</span> <span data-start="362.8" data-end="364.51">with data knows it's the same thing as</span> <span data-start="364.51" data-end="367.69">the zip file source control thing it's</span> <span data-start="367.69" data-end="369.55">like you find an ftp server you download</span> <span data-start="369.55" data-end="371.38">a CSV if to parse the CSV into your</span> <span data-start="371.38" data-end="373.12">database you end up writing like a stack</span> <span data-start="373.12" data-end="374.53">of code that only does one thing and</span> <span data-start="374.53" data-end="377.919">it's super monolithic and brittle and if</span> <span data-start="377.919" data-end="379.36">six months later you want to switch to a</span> <span data-start="379.36" data-end="380.68">different database you have to rewrite</span> <span data-start="380.68" data-end="382.75">all your code or if you want to download</span> <span data-start="382.75" data-end="385.63">the CSV again you have to like delete</span> <span data-start="385.63" data-end="387.34">all the data you imported last time and</span> <span data-start="387.34" data-end="388.36">then just re-import the whole thing</span> <span data-start="388.36" data-end="389.77">again or it's just like there's no</span> <span data-start="389.77" data-end="391.75">automation if there's no automation</span> <span data-start="391.75" data-end="393.19">there's no reproducibility for these</span> <span data-start="393.19" data-end="395.71">scientists so you know you have to do</span> <span data-start="395.71" data-end="397.47">things like emailing CSV files around</span> <span data-start="397.47" data-end="399.9">now this is a popular one if it fits in</span> <span data-start="399.9" data-end="401.52">the in get you can just put like you</span> <span data-start="401.52" data-end="403.86">know your sequel table or export into</span> <span data-start="403.86" data-end="406.71">get which is you know just like a crazy</span> <span data-start="406.71" data-end="410.25">hack and so we're just trying to do for</span> <span data-start="410.25" data-end="412.14">data what get did for source code and</span> <span data-start="412.14" data-end="414.51">don't take that to literally some some</span> <span data-start="414.51" data-end="415.83">people think I like we literally have</span> <span data-start="415.83" data-end="418.26">the same commands as good but it's a</span> <span data-start="418.26" data-end="419.61">different problem so we have a different</span> <span data-start="419.61" data-end="422.04">approach but we're inspired by the</span> <span data-start="422.04" data-end="424.56">automation that get brings so dad is a</span> <span data-start="424.56" data-end="426.45">module you can install that and we have</span> <span data-start="426.45" data-end="428.91">a

data-end="1064.59">from the brow</span> <span data-start="1064.59" data-end="1067.049">to the server so the point of this is</span> <span data-start="1067.049" data-end="1068.309">you have this tutorial over here that</span> <span data-start="1068.309" data-end="1070.5">teaches you the fundamentals of debt you</span> <span data-start="1070.5" data-end="1073.26">can also do stuff like require an HTTP</span> <span data-start="1073.26" data-end="1083.59">server um and a live coding with latency</span> <span data-start="1083.6" data-end="1086.19">so if I write a little HTTP server in</span> <span data-start="1086.19" data-end="1088.26">here we wanted it to be real so it's</span> <span data-start="1088.26" data-end="1091.86">like you could actually do real stuff on</span> <span data-start="1091.86" data-end="1093.48">a real server and not do like a fake</span> <span data-start="1093.48" data-end="1094.799">environment like what like Codecademy</span> <span data-start="1094.799" data-end="1097.02">does or something like that so if I just</span> <span data-start="1097.02" data-end="1103.32">say res and high then i go to my welcome</span> <span data-start="1103.32" data-end="1105.809">text it has a when you load the page it</span> <span data-start="1105.809" data-end="1108.63">gives you a unique coast and anything</span> <span data-start="1108.63" data-end="1110.49">that listens on port 80 is a real server</span> <span data-start="1110.49" data-end="1112.919">on the real internet so I have high here</span> <span data-start="1112.919" data-end="1116.159">so what's cool is when you close the tab</span> <span data-start="1116.159" data-end="1119.46">we close the process so you can't it's</span> <span data-start="1119.46" data-end="1121.23">kind of like our anti abuse policy so</span> <span data-start="1121.23" data-end="1123.96">now I can't find it but we do store the</span> <span data-start="1123.96" data-end="1126.57">data so in the tutorial you actually use</span> <span data-start="1126.57" data-end="1128.22">a real debt you start a real debt server</span> <span data-start="1128.22" data-end="1129.99">and you actually actually clone your own</span> <span data-start="1129.99" data-end="1131.58">data from the server down to your laptop</span> <span data-start="1131.58" data-end="1133.35">so you install that locally on like step</span> <span data-start="1133.35" data-end="1135.6">5 so we want to do something real and</span> <span data-start="1135.6" data-end="1138.09">this is actually a preview of we're</span> <span data-start="1138.09" data-end="1139.95">working on adding this functionality to</span> <span data-start="1139.95" data-end="1142.11">all node schools so that anyone can get</span> <span data-start="1142.11" data-end="1144.33">notes cool in one click and not have to</span> <span data-start="1144.33" data-end="1146.22">install everything locally if they don't</span> <span data-start="1146.22" data-end="1151.95">want to so we're also working on a bunch</span> <span data-start="1151.95" data-end="1153.33">of DNA processing one of people on our</span> <span data-start="1153.33" data-end="1154.919">team is doing his PhD on this stuff and</span> <span data-start="1154.919" data-end="1156.24">we have a project called bio node and</span> <span data-start="1156.24" data-end="1157.83">what that has taught us is that we need</span> <span data-start="1157.83" data-end="1159.929">to set you handle these advanced data</span> <span data-start="1159.929" data-end="1161.52">pipelines with lots of crazy</span> <span data-start="1161.52" data-end="1162.809">dependencies and everything needs to be</span> <span data-start="1162.809" data-end="1164.51">streaming because the data sets are huge</span> <span data-start="1164.51" data-end="1167.309">and we're using a lot of docker for</span> <span data-start="1167.309" data-end="1168.779">automating these really difficult to</span> <span data-start="1168.779" data-end="1171.87">install bioinformatics tools we've been</span> <span data-start="1171.87" data-end="1172.89">playing around with this thing called</span> <span data-start="1172.89" data-end="1174.149">gasket if you were at node comp this</span> <span data-start="1174.149" data-end="1175.74">summer we had a very early version of</span> <span data-start="1175.74" data-end="1177.48">that which is like trying to build these</span> <span data-start="1177.48" data-end="1179.19">cross-platform data pipelines we're</span> <span data-start="1179.19" data-end="1181.11">basically it's a really cool use case</span> <span data-start="1181.11" data-end="1182.97">for note I think because it's note isn't</span> <span data-start="1182.97" data-end="1184.95">doing is the computation notice spawning</span> <span data-start="1184.95" data-end="1186.299">the processes and moving the data</span> <span data-start="1186.299" data-end="1188.399">between them so it's just I mean that's</span> <span data-start="1188.399" data-end="1190.83">kind of I mean it's io literally it's</span> <span data-start="1190.83" data-end="1193.95">what note is built for and not</span> <span data-start="1193.95" data-end="1196.02">everything is 11 min monolithic note app</span> <span data-start="1196.02" data-end="1198.36">it's an invented pipeline where data is</span> <span data-start="1198.36" data-end="1198.84">getting pipe</span> <span data-start="1198.84" data-end="1200.25">in and out of different places and</span> <span data-start="1200.25" data-end="1201.62">coming from different network services</span> <span data-start="1201.62" data-end="1203.76">so I think it's a really cool use case</span> <span data-start="1203.76" data-end="1205.62">and gasket looks like this it's JSON and</span> <span data-start="1205.62" data-end="1207.78">you can declare pipelines but it's</span> <span data-start="1207.78" data-end="1209.22">little bit too linear for us so we've</span> <span data-start="1209.22" data-end="1210.93">been experimenting with a single debt</span> <span data-start="1210.93" data-end="1214.17">script super experimental which you can</span> <span data-start="1214.17" data-end="1216.81">define pipelines that do stuff like you</span> <span data-start="1216.81" data-end="1219.12">know this is a reads pipeline it will</span> <span data-start="1219.12" data-end="1221.73">run a search that outputs JSON and then</span> <span data-start="1221.73" data-end="1224.73">fork for pipelines and pipe the search</span> <span data-start="1224.73" data-end="1226.95">output into all four and then aggregate</span> <span data-start="1226.95" data-end="1230.04">those for pipelines into a debt so you</span> <span data-start="1230.04" data-end="1231.71">can do really powerful stuff in a really</span> <span data-start="1231.71" data-end="1234.81">simple expressive syntax this is like</span> <span data-start="1234.81" data-end="1236.61">super alpha but where this is the kind</span> <span data-start="1236.61" data-end="1238.92">of stuff that were interested in stuff</span> <span data-start="1238.92" data-end="1240.3">that's the future of the project we want</span> <span data-start="1240.3" data-end="1242.31">to be able to check out a data set to a</span> <span data-start="1242.31" data-end="1244.26">specific point in time just like it so</span> <span data-start="1244.26" data-end="1245.7">you can say get me the data as it was</span> <span data-start="1245.7" data-end="1247.8">two weeks ago so that when you publish</span> <span data-start="1247.8" data-end="1249.54">your paper you can have the hash of the</span> <span data-start="1249.54" data-end="1250.77">data of the paper so people can</span> <span data-start="1250.77" data-end="1253.35">reproduce it we're doing a lot of really</span> <span data-start="1253.35" data-end="1254.4">cool stuff for multi-master replication</span> <span data-start="1254.4" data-end="1256.95">and merging that Matthias will talk</span> <span data-start="1256.95" data-end="1259.5">about and we want to sync to a bunch of</span> <span data-start="1259.5" data-end="1261.48">different databases so that you can have</span> <span data-start="1261.48" data-end="1264.06">stuff like I wrote a thing the other day</span> <span data-start="1264.06" data-end="1266.01">that takes any data from debt and puts</span> <span data-start="1266.01" data-end="1267.6">it into a full text index you can just</span> <span data-start="1267.6" data-end="1268.86">do that automatically and not have to</span> <span data-start="1268.86" data-end="1270.93">install a database it uses sequel light</span> <span data-start="1270.93" data-end="1272.28">under the hood but we can stopped up for</span> <span data-start="1272.28" data-end="1274.53">like elasticsearch doing these like data</span> <span data-start="1274.53" data-end="1277.32">automation tasks and then finally we're</span> <span data-start="1277.32" data-end="1278.49">building a registry which is like what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1278.49" data-end="1281.67">I'm super excited about the registry is</span> <span data-start="1281.67" data-end="1283.2">like a super sneak preview first time</span> <span data-start="1283.2" data-end="1284.94">we've shown it publicly at all it's not</span> <span data-start="1284.94" data-end="1286.65">even like Alpha yet we're still working</span> <span data-start="1286.65" data-end="1288.24">on the first version but you'll be able</span> <span data-start="1288.24" data-end="1289.98">to publish data sets to the registry and</span> <span data-start="1289.98" data-end="1291.81">find them and clone them and get</span> <span data-start="1291.81" data-end="1293.85">information about them and actually view</span> <span data-start="1293.85" data-end="1296.28">the data in line and this is super super</span> <span data-start="1296.28" data-end="1298.65">early like i said but we think that</span> <span data-start="1298.65" data-end="1300.51">putting all the data online and making</span> <span data-start="1300.51" data-end="1302.67">it easy to find is going to help a lot</span> <span data-start="1302.67" data-end="1305.84">of these build these ecosystems out so</span> <span data-start="1305.84" data-end="1309.09">with that this is like how to find us</span> <span data-start="1309.09" data-end="1311.61">dad on freenode we have a gator and or</span> <span data-start="1311.61" data-end="1313.47">also the debt repo and i'll hand it off</span> <span data-start="1313.47" data-end="1319.6">to Matthias now thank you</span> </p>
