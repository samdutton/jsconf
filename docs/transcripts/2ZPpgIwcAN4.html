data-start="49.059" data-end="51.25">a little closer to what I care about a</span> <span data-start="51.25" data-end="53.8">bit count what we do a bit hound we</span> <span data-start="53.8" data-end="56.76">analyze code to look for quality and</span> <span data-start="56.76" data-end="58.42">maintainability and it's trying to</span> <span data-start="58.42" data-end="61.149">figure out what objectively and suitably</span> <span data-start="61.149" data-end="65.259">is good code so um what I'm going to</span> <span data-start="65.259" data-end="69.13">talk something that happened at our</span> <span data-start="69.13" data-end="73.27">company is the concept of adding new</span> <span data-start="73.27" data-end="75.88">people we had a we had two new</span> <span data-start="75.88" data-end="79.24">developers coming on board and their</span> <span data-start="79.24" data-end="81.399">same day and we are doing our kind of</span> <span data-start="81.399" data-end="84.67">intro that first for our kind of chunk</span> <span data-start="84.67" data-end="87.729">of the day where I was getting their</span> <span data-start="87.729" data-end="90.16">machine set up talking with them giving</span> <span data-start="90.16" data-end="92.349">an overall architecture of overview of</span> <span data-start="92.349" data-end="95.679">how bit hound works and something kind</span> <span data-start="95.679" data-end="98.229">of cool happened that by lunchtime even</span> <span data-start="98.229" data-end="100.539">with talking we had both of their</span> <span data-start="100.539" data-end="102.729">laptops which were just freshly opened</span> <span data-start="102.729" data-end="105.64">at 9am out of the packaging had our</span> <span

data-start="111.009" data-end="112.929">a couple simple pull requests from them</span> <span data-start="112.929" data-end="118.149">within that first like day and it really</span> <span data-start="118.149" data-end="120.39">got me thinking about the concept of</span> <span data-start="120.39" data-end="123.33">onboarding new people into our projects</span> <span data-start="123.33" data-end="126.75">and just that cart like how to bring</span> <span data-start="126.75" data-end="129.22">people on board to have them be</span> <span data-start="129.22" data-end="131.849">contributing and be productive quickly</span> <span data-start="131.849" data-end="136.51">so another thing that um that is</span> <span data-start="136.51" data-end="138.4">important is that this I'm going to be</span> <span data-start="138.4" data-end="140.59">talking a lot about my experience with</span> <span data-start="140.59" data-end="142.269">our clothes source project or our</span> <span data-start="142.269" data-end="144.4">application but a lot of this</span> <span data-start="144.4" data-end="145.819">information that I'm sharing</span> <span data-start="145.819" data-end="148.129">so works in trans files really nicely to</span> <span data-start="148.129" data-end="151.04">the the open source community we're in</span> <span data-start="151.04" data-end="153.17">an open source community new people</span> <span data-start="153.17" data-end="155.09">coming on board of your to your project</span> <span data-start="155.09" data-end="158.329">is in a largely asynchronous fashion you</span> <span data-start="158.329" data-end="160.249">don't necessarily have interaction with</span> <span data-start="160.249" data-end="163">someone who finds your project on github</span> <span data-start="163" data-end="165.889">clones it down reads it and tries to get</span> <span data-start="165.889" data-end="168.019">up and running to add add what they feel</span> <span data-start="168.019" data-end="171.109">as value to their project so there's a</span> <span data-start="171.109" data-end="173.299">little bit more of a upfront cost with</span> <span data-start="173.299" data-end="175.329">an open source project versus we're in</span> <span data-start="175.329" data-end="177.919">traditional closed source or like a</span> <span data-start="177.919" data-end="179.84">company project you have a face-to-face</span> <span data-start="179.84"

data-end="192.079">new developers so the key is is as I was</span> <span data-start="192.079" data-end="195.23">trying to figure out what exactly the</span> <span data-start="195.23" data-end="198.079">topic of this how to convey it the one</span> <span data-start="198.079" data-end="199.939">key thing I kept circling around to is I</span> <span data-start="199.939" data-end="201.439">was doing the hallway track with</span> <span data-start="201.439" data-end="203.48">everyone here and trying to explain when</span> <span data-start="203.48" data-end="205.01">they're like what exactly you talking</span> <span data-start="205.01" data-end="207.29">about is that nothing what I'm going to</span> <span data-start="207.29" data-end="210.769">say is new there's not going to be a</span> <span data-start="210.769" data-end="214.34">giant beam of knowledge transferred down</span> <span data-start="214.34" data-end="217.819">where I'm going to blow your mind we all</span> <span data-start="217.819" data-end="220.009">know this we all have this gut feeling</span> <span data-start="220.009" data-end="223.519">of where where our problems are on our</span> <span data-start="223.519" data-end="225.319">code base how hard it is get running</span> <span data-start="225.319" data-end="227.509">those little gotchas that have tripped</span> <span data-start="227.509" data-end="231.739">us up in the past so another thing as I</span> <span data-start="231.739" data-end="233.629">was putting together my my slides was</span> <span data-start="233.629" data-end="236.239">that there's not a lot of JavaScript in</span> <span data-start="236.239"

<span data-start="720.45" data-end="722.91">is that there are a couple ways to</span> <span data-start="722.91" data-end="726.06">comment your code you can comment what</span> <span data-start="726.06" data-end="729.18">your code does or you can comment why</span> <span data-start="729.18" data-end="732.54">your code does that and we've all kind</span> <span data-start="732.54" data-end="734.28">of seen those comments that kind of</span> <span data-start="734.28" data-end="737.64">reference what the code is doing but</span> <span data-start="737.64" data-end="739.32">there's a better way to do that and it's</span> <span data-start="739.32" data-end="745.02">called code so you you know you can you</span> <span data-start="745.02" data-end="747">can stop doing that we have its self</span> <span data-start="747" data-end="749.22">documented least try to name that's</span> <span data-start="749.22" data-end="751.02">where naming of your variables naming of</span> <span data-start="751.02" data-end="753.6">your functions trying to have an</span> <span data-start="753.6" data-end="756.75">expressive form of coding is a much</span> <span data-start="756.75" data-end="759.69">better way of documenting in code but</span> <span data-start="759.69" data-end="761.64">with that being said what that frees</span> <span data-start="761.64" data-end="764.4">your code comments to do is to talk</span> <span data-start="764.4" data-end="766.62">about the the part that is really</span> <span data-start="766.62" data-end="769.71">missing is the why we can all look at</span> <span data-start="769.71" data-end="771.27">code you can kind of look and go okay</span> <span data-start="771.27" data-end="772.83">that's a darating over X and blah blah</span> <span data-start="772.83" data-end="775.02">blah and then you call off to this</span> <span data-start="775.02" data-end="778.23">little section over here but and and I</span> <span data-start="778.23" data-end="779.7">new developer coming in will be like oh</span> <span data-start="779.7" data-end="781.41">well I don't need to call over there</span> <span data-start="781.41" data-end="782.85">that's an efficient and bought and then</span> <span data-start="782.85" data-end="784.02">you realize that the only reason you</span> <span data-start="784.02" data-end="786.9">were doing that was six months ago that</span> <span data-start="786.9" data-end="788.57">like server like how i got over</span> <span data-start="788.57" data-end="790.56">overloaded and like let's just like</span> <span data-start="790.56" data-end="792.36">throw it off here so we can load balance</span> <span data-start="792.36" data-end="796.05">it that informations sometimes lost so</span> <span data-start="796.05" data-end="798.9">try to keep those little fugly places of</span> <span data-start="798.9" data-end="801.9">your code document it about why it's</span> <span data-start="801.9" data-end="807.44">fugly now any talk kind of about this is</span> <span data-start="807.44" data-end="812.54">i have i have a new bestie project is</span> <span data-start="812.54"

data-end="856.79">permutation you have bad ground allows</span> <span data-start="856.79" data-end="858.68">you to have a standardized virtual</span> <span data-start="858.68" data-end="861.16">environment that your code is hosted in</span> <span data-start="861.16" data-end="863.779">and something that actually happened</span> <span data-start="863.779" data-end="866.17">that bit hound that was really</span> <span data-start="866.17" data-end="869.389">interesting was we we do a very largely</span> <span data-start="869.389" data-end="872.089">distributed platform so all of our code</span> <span data-start="872.089" data-end="873.68">that gets analyzed as we're processing</span> <span data-start="873.68" data-end="876.589">your code gets sent out to a bunch of</span> <span data-start="876.589" data-end="879.829">worker machines and handled and messaged</span> <span data-start="879.829" data-end="882.11">back and forth um and we were working on</span> <span data-start="882.11" data-end="884.48">this for a while before we launched at</span> <span data-start="884.48" data-end="887.63">last ge'ez comp and i was working it on</span> <span data-start="887.63" data-end="890.089">my laptop and then we deployed it and we</span> <span data-start="890.089" data-end="891.709">came here like hey let's start letting</span> <span data-start="891.709" data-end="893.48">people on and I realized very quickly</span> <span data-start="893.48" data-end="896.889">that what works well on one machine</span> <span data-start="896.889" data-end="899.63">doesn't necessarily work the same when</span> <span data-start="899.63" data-end="901.48">there's two three four hundred machines</span> <span data-start="901.48" data-end="904.04">so some of those assumptions that I made</span> <span data-start="904.04" data-end="905.959">in my configuration when I'm working</span> <span data-start="905.959" data-end="909.439">here didn't quite scale when I was</span> <span data-start="909.439" data-end="910.939">working in the distributed environment</span> <span data-start="910.939" data-end="913.06">so what this allowed me to do was</span> <span data-start="913.06" data-end="915.98">virtualize a mini version of what</span> <span data-start="915.98" data-end="918.38">production is down to the exact</span> <span data-start="918.38" data-end="920.449">operating system that we're running to</span> <span data-start="920.449" data-end="922.73">the fact that even with our local</span> <span data-start="922.73" data-end="925.67">development we're running node in a</span> <span data-start="925.67" data-end="928.31">multiple servers service instances</span> <span data-start="928.31" data-end="931.88">behind the engine X caching layer with</span> <span data-start="931.88" data-end="935.209">its hosting self-signed ssl certs so</span> <span data-start="935.209" data-end="937.759">exactly what's happening on production</span> <span data-start="937.759" data-end="940.49">is what our local developers are using</span> <span data-start="940.49" data-end="944">and the job when a job it's cued it goes</span> <span data-start="944" data-end="946.279">through the same idea through the</span> <span data-start="946.279" data-end="947.12">messages to</span> <span data-start="947.12" data-end="948.95">a bunch of machines so all those</span> <span data-start="948.95" data-end="951.32">assumptions that we make that obviously</span> <span data-start="951.32" data-end="953.23">this message will be handled by the</span> <span data-start="953.23" data-end="955.64">machine that also handled this message</span> <span data-start="955.64" data-end="957.65">so we can share things which in a</span> <span data-start="957.65" data-end="959.95">distributed environment is never true</span> <span data-start="959.95" data-end="963.77">now there's a key to using bagman this</span> <span data-start="963.77" data-end="967.22">is kind of where where my experience</span> <span data-start="967.22" data-end="970.79">lies is as awesome as it is you want to</span> <span data-start="970.79" data-end="972.95">hide the fact that you're using vagrant</span> <span data-start="972.95" data-end="975.37">the only thing that should really be</span> <span data-start="975.37" data-end="978.32">evident when you're using bad grain is</span> <span data-start="978.32" data-end="980.69">when someone comes you and says my</span> <span data-start="980.69" data-end="983.36">machine stopped working you and say run</span> <span data-start="983.36" data-end="985.67">vagrant destroy and vagrant up and they</span> <span data-start="985.67" data-end="987.95">can create a new one and you can ask</span> <span data-start="987.95" data-end="989.87">does it work and they can say yes and</span> <span data-start="989.87" data-end="993.08">you can let let them go back to what</span> <span data-start="993.08" data-end="999.9">they were doing so the way to do this is</span> <span data-start="999.91" data-end="1002.92">using port forwarding is the first thing</span> <span data-start="1002.92" data-end="1008.14">so yeah I will hit localhost 8080 air I</span> <span data-start="1008.14" data-end="1010.83">can use the tools that I'm familiar with</span> <span data-start="1010.83" data-end="1014.79">also whenever you're using vagrant</span> <span data-start="1014.79" data-end="1016.99">you'll have people say oh well yeah</span> <span data-start="1016.99" data-end="1020.86">vagrant up and then vagrant SSH into the</span>

people call it some</span> <span data-start="1084.07" data-end="1086.89">other things but what that does is allow</span> <span data-start="1086.89" data-end="1089.38">all the arguments that you're
