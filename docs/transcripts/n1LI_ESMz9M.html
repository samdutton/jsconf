data-end="555.83">basically this first i'm going to get</span> <span data-start="555.83" data-end="558.17">the tab count using the count method and</span> <span data-start="558.17" data-end="560.3">then I'm just going to display a simple</span> <span data-start="560.3" data-end="562.49">dialogue alert which is basically this</span> <span data-start="562.49" data-end="564.59">similar to window dot alert except here</span> <span data-start="564.59" data-end="567.05">we don't have access to window so we</span> <span data-start="567.05" data-end="569.09">have to use this module and I'm going to</span> <span data-start="569.09" data-end="571.31">hat say you have this many tabs open</span> <span data-start="571.31" data-end="575.84">right so just as a quick start so let's</span> <span data-start="575.84" data-end="578.24">try that will save that and try and</span> <span data-start="578.24" data-end="580.19">browser right and no restart required</span> <span data-start="580.19" data-end="582.32">the extensions installed i'm going to</span> <span data-start="582.32" data-end="584.24">open a new tab and says you have two</span> <span data-start="584.24" data-end="588.49">tabs open okay so that's that so go back</span> <span data-start="588.49" data-end="590.66">we want to do something more interesting</span> <span data-start="590.66" data-end="593.15">than that and we can so so I'm just</span> <span data-start="593.15" data-end="596.12">going to strip this back out and change</span> <span data-start="596.12" data-end="599.12">it so that if we have more than 20 tabs</span> <span data-start="599.12" data-end="600.98">open right I'm going to say that's the</span> <span data-start="600.98" data-end="606.35">maximum threshold then I'm gonna harass</span> <span data-start="606.35" data-end="610.43">the user myself by displaying an alert</span> <span data-start="610.43" data-end="612.77">but actually a confirmation yes no</span> <span data-start="612.77" data-end="615.29">confirmation that says you already have</span> <span data-start="615.29" data-end="619.19">too many tabs open right and I can let</span> <span data-start="619.19" data-end="621.32">you go ahead and open this but then I'm</span> <span data-start="621.32" data-end="623">going to randomly select one of your</span> <span data-start="623" data-end="628.43">other tabs and close it right is that</span> <span data-start="628.43" data-end="630.62">okay and you say yes or no and that will</span> <span data-start="630.62" data-end="633.19">return a true value or false value right</span> <span data-start="633.19" data-end="637.7">so if the answer is true if I said yes</span> <span data-start="637.7" data-end="640.1">go ahead and do that then we're not</span> <span data-start="640.1" data-end="641.6">going to mess with the current tab we</span> <span data-start="641.6" data-end="642.92">just open but instead I'm going to use</span> <span data-start="642.92" data-end="645.11">tab remove and I'm going to we already</span> <span data-start="645.11" data-end="646.46">know the tab count I'm going to pick a</span> <span data-start="646.46" data-end="648.98">random index using round and then floor</span> <span data-start="648.98" data-end="653.81">and pick a random tab index tab tabs</span> <span data-start="653.81" data-end="656.06">retrieve that and then tabs not remove</span> <span data-start="656.06" data-end="658.46">that very straightforward pick a random</span> <span data-start="658.46" data-end="662.36">tab close it if the answer is no if I</span> <span data-start="662.36" data-end="664.76">said no then what we want to do is close</span> <span data-start="664.76" data-end="667.85">the new tab that we are we just opened</span> <span data-start="667.85" data-end="670.1">technically so I'm just going to tabs</span> <span data-start="670.1" data-end="671.07">out remove</span> <span data-start="671.07" data-end="674.37">tabs out retrieve tab count minus one so</span> <span data-start="674.37" data-end="676.02">the last tab I'm just going to close</span> <span data-start="676.02" data-end="678.21">that the one you just tried to open so</span> <span data-start="678.21" data-end="679.83">let's try this out we'll try it in the</span> <span data-start="679.83" data-end="684.03">browser and just to test this I have a</span> <span data-start="684.03" data-end="686.03">bookmarks folder with 20 different</span> <span data-start="686.03" data-end="688.56">bookmarks in it they're just google</span> <span data-start="688.56" data-end="692.01">searches for 1 through 20 so i'll open</span> <span data-start="692.01" data-end="696.87">that in tabs so we get 20 tabs yes i</span> <span data-start="696.87" data-end="700.68">want to open 20 tabs so there we have 20</span> <span data-start="700.68" data-end="704.7">tabs right just 1 through 20 nothing up</span> <span data-start="704.7" data-end="709.65">my sleeve all right um and well Oh URL</span> <span data-start="709.65" data-end="711.27">encoding I like that so i'll check that</span> <span data-start="711.27" data-end="713.1">out um so i try to open that in a new</span> <span data-start="713.1" data-end="715.52">tab you already have too many tabs open</span> <span data-start="715.52" data-end="717.81">yes go ahead and randomly close</span> <span data-start="717.81" data-end="720.48">something else okay and so now I look</span> <span data-start="720.48" data-end="724.14">down and number 7 is gone alright so</span> <span data-start="724.14" data-end="727.38">this could be really annoying but notice</span> <span data-start="727.38" data-end="729.75">how easy it was to write this with a</span> <span data-start="729.75" data-end="732.12">very ajax e very straightforward api</span> <span data-start="732.12" data-end="733.89">much more straightforward than the</span> <span data-start="733.89" data-end="737.1">actual xpcom internals i might add very</span> <span data-start="737.1" data-end="739.35">straight forward with a fantastic ide</span> <span data-start="739.35" data-end="741.06">and this is just the prototype and</span> <span data-start="741.06" data-end="742.89">hopefully there will be other tools as</span> <span data-start="742.89" data-end="746.46">well that build on this sdk so this all</span> <span data-start="746.46" data-end="749.22">began with a blog post like many things</span> <span data-start="749.22" data-end="752.97">do back last year in May the jetpack</span> <span data-start="752.97"

data-end="759.96">platform has really exploded a lot of</span> <span data-start="759.96" data-end="762.47">people have been reading writing jetpack</span> <span data-start="762.47" data-end="765.71">add-ons on top of this jetpack prototype</span> <span data-start="765.71" data-end="769.68">but alas this was just a prototype so</span> <span data-start="769.68" data-end="771.87">right now we're in this process called</span> <span data-start="771.87" data-end="774.6">the jetpack reboot and really it's very</span> <span data-start="774.6" data-end="777.87">straightforward this is the idea harder</span> <span data-start="777.87" data-end="780.36">better faster stronger that that's the</span> <span data-start="780.36"
