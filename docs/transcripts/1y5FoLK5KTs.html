at these api's that are used on on</span> <span data-start="103.02" data-end="105.119">the machines and there's an there's</span> <span data-start="105.119" data-end="106.7">actually an open source

the APD use APD use or sort of the</span> <span data-start="388.43" data-end="391.97">frames and they're anything from sort of</span> <span data-start="391.97" data-end="394.85">an IP frame all the

their</span> <span data-start="407.04" data-end="409.67">commands that you sent to the card and</span> <span data-start="409.67" data-end="412.2">this is what a what a pack of like that</span> <span data-start="412.2" data-end="414.33">looks like you start off it's it's</span> <span data-start="414.33" data-end="417.99">always four bytes the first quite is the</span> <span data-start="417.99" data-end="420.03">class which is sort of metadata about</span> <span data-start="420.03" data-end="424.53">this will the payload be encrypted is</span> <span data-start="424.53" data-end="428.61">this a is this an iso standardized</span> <span data-start="428.61" data-end="431.07">command things like that the second one</span> <span data-start="431.07" data-end="433.74">is the actual command that's that that's</span> <span data-start="433.74" data-end="436.05">being performed that could be something</span> <span data-start="436.05" data-end="439.41">like select a file or an application on</span> <span data-start="439.41" data-end="442.89">the card or I want to give you I want to</span> <span data-start="442.89" data-end="445.65">present you a pin for me to to verify</span> <span data-start="445.65" data-end="450.419">for me then p1 and p2 are parameters for</span> <span data-start="450.419" data-end="454.47">the command and then optionally you can</span> <span data-start="454.47" data-end="457.5">send data then you do an LC where you</span> <span data-start="457.5" data-end="458.85">would say how many bytes of data you</span> <span data-start="458.85" data-end="461.61">send and then the bytes that you send</span> <span data-start="461.61" data-end="463.62">and if you want the command to answer</span> <span data-start="463.62" data-end="465.69">back you would you would send le the</span> <span data-start="465.69" data-end="467.01">length of the expected data that you</span> <span data-start="467.01" data-end="472.229">sent back so the way this okay well you</span> <span data-start="472.229" data-end="475.35">can skip over these bits I think there's</span> <span data-start="475.35" data-end="477.18">different sorts of files that the whole</span> <span data-start="477.18" data-end="479.04">thing defines and the files can be more</span> <span data-start="479.04" data-end="480.93">or less anything they just have names</span> <span data-start="480.93" data-end="482.55">but the way that they can either be a</span> <span data-start="482.55" data-end="485.28">big chunk of data they can be variable</span> <span data-start="485.28" data-end="487.05">or fixed length records they can be</span> <span data-start="487.05" data-end="490.86">circular buffers so to be a little bit</span> <span data-start="490.86" data-end="492.72">more concrete how this how this works</span> <span data-start="492.72" data-end="495.36">this would be an APU that a terminal</span> <span data-start="495.36" data-end="500.1">sends to to a card and so it starts the</span> <span data-start="500.1" data-end="503.16">first bit the clasp is 0 the instruction</span> <span data-start="503.16" data-end="505.2">is a 4 that means select select an</span> <span

data-end="522.39">select so I'm going to send it e eb hex</span> <span data-start="522.39" data-end="527.61">e that's up 14 bytes and that last bit</span> <span data-start="527.61" data-end="528.64">if you</span> <span data-start="528.64" data-end="531.64">you're gonna ASCII and hex it's called</span> <span data-start="531.64" data-end="535.21">it's one basis DDF or one that's what</span> <span data-start="535.21" data-end="537.7">all credit cards basically happens there</span> <span data-start="537.7" data-end="540.04">base application what everybody starts</span> <span data-start="540.04" data-end="544.69">out so lightly and what you get back is</span> <span data-start="544.69" data-end="546.85">the response code says word one says for</span> <span data-start="546.85" data-end="549.1">two usually you will you would want 9000</span> <span data-start="549.1" data-end="553.18">9000 as sort of the is sort of the 200</span> <span data-start="553.18" data-end="558.88">okay of the smart card world 61 is sort</span> <span data-start="558.88" data-end="564.82">of a almost okay but I can't there's</span> <span data-start="564.82" data-end="566.47">some technical problems that the card</span> <span data-start="566.47" data-end="570.55">can send back data in response to a</span> <span data-start="570.55"

data-end="578.41">would like to send you back data it's</span> <span data-start="578.41" data-end="579.82">technically not possible though but</span> <span data-start="579.82" data-end="582.1">there's 12 hex bytes of data I want to</span> <span data-start="582.1" data-end="584.86">send you back so the next command and</span> <span data-start="584.86" data-end="586.18">these are the only two commands don't</span> <span data-start="586.18" data-end="589.72">worry that I'm I'm going to show C 0 is</span> <span data-start="589.72" data-end="593.32">a get response it doesn't take any</span> <span data-start="593.32" data-end="596.11">parameters it doesn't have any data that</span> <span data-start="596.11" data-end="597.7">it sends but it says I'm expecting</span> <span
