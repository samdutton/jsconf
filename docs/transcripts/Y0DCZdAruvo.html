data-start="44.51" data-end="48.17">your ass and such gb i posted the slides</span> <span data-start="48.17" data-end="51.109">online for you to see I'm be back when</span> <span data-start="51.109" data-end="53.48">did have and i have a blog at and</span> <span data-start="53.48" data-end="57.62">panning for calm i'm also writing a book</span> <span data-start="57.62" data-end="59.539">it's called a javascript application</span> <span data-start="59.539" data-end="65">design all right about processes how to</span> <span data-start="65" data-end="67.7">write modular applications there are</span> <span data-start="67.7" data-end="71.36">testable and it comes with a lot of code</span> <span data-start="71.36" data-end="74.06">samples that are fully documented you</span> <span data-start="74.06" data-end="77.899">can look at here's the disc and God if</span> <span data-start="77.899" data-end="79.88">you're interested just go to that URL</span> <span data-start="79.88" data-end="84.59">and check out with it so for today's</span> <span data-start="84.59" data-end="87.77">talk I'm going to talk about the reasons</span> <span data-start="87.77" data-end="92.54">to build and the development flow I'm</span> <span data-start="92.54" data-end="96.829">going to talk about how to put together</span> <span data-start="96.829" data-end="98.96">a development flow that works for you</span> <span data-start="98.96" data-end="102.049">and which tools you could use and I'm</span> <span data-start="102.049" data-end="103.82">going to talk about the different kind</span> <span data-start="103.82" data-end="106.34">of tasks that you can perform with those</span> <span data-start="106.34" data-end="109.07">tools also i'm going to talk about</span> <span data-start="109.07" data-end="112.009">molarity and in particular and when they</span> <span data-start="112.009" data-end="114.649">talk about had to bring molarity into</span> <span data-start="114.649" data-end="119.299">the browser so the first question I have</span> <span data-start="119.299" data-end="123.2">is why build and more importantly why</span> <span data-start="123.2" data-end="125.75">build first rather than somewhere down</span> <span data-start="125.75" data-end="129.22">the line and the reasons for these are</span> <span data-start="129.22" data-end="134.41">process productivity and performance</span> <span data-start="134.42" data-end="137.61">process really means that you are able</span> <span data-start="137.61" data-end="141.57">to automate animation really is all</span> <span data-start="141.57" data-end="144.92">about reducing and eliminating</span> <span data-start="144.92" data-end="151.23">repetitive work and it also means it</span> <span data-start="151.23" data-end="154.95">also helps you to reduce human for</span> <span data-start="154.95" data-end="157.23">instance if you go to that link you'll</span> <span data-start="157.23" data-end="160.38">find the story about the company who</span> <span data-start="160.38" data-end="164.07">work on the stock exchange and they had</span> <span data-start="164.07" data-end="168.3">one guy doing deployments on nine</span> <span data-start="168.3" data-end="171.09">different boxes and he did it by hand on</span> <span data-start="171.09" data-end="175.61">each one of those and they also had</span> <span data-start="175.61" data-end="178.38">coding production that was ten year old</span> <span data-start="178.38" data-end="182.37">and they didn't use it and it was shot</span> <span data-start="182.37" data-end="186.72">serum behind a flag and they pushed some</span> <span data-start="186.72" data-end="188.76">new code to eight of those nine</span> <span data-start="188.76" data-end="191.6">instances because he just forgot one and</span> <span data-start="191.6" data-end="197.37">and he he forgot to reply to that one</span> <span data-start="197.37" data-end="200.43">and the issue was that the new code was</span> <span data-start="200.43" data-end="203.4">behind this old flag that they just</span> <span data-start="203.4" data-end="207.29">changed to do something else but in the</span> <span data-start="207.29" data-end="210.95">ninth box it still did the same thing</span> <span data-start="210.95" data-end="214.98">and so they started losing money because</span> <span data-start="214.98" data-end="218.07">they were they were making batter</span> <span data-start="218.07" data-end="222.15">requests and and they tried to figure</span> <span data-start="222.15" data-end="223.86">out what the issue was Anna and they</span> <span data-start="223.86" data-end="225.69">thought it was in the new in the new</span> <span data-start="225.69" data-end="228.57">code so they started rolling that back</span> <span data-start="228.57" data-end="230.31">and they started losing more and more</span> <span data-start="230.31" data-end="233.52">money and they went bankrupt in like 30</span> <span data-start="233.52" data-end="235.62">minutes they lost half a billion dollars</span> <span data-start="235.62" data-end="238.41">so like I said you're reduces human or</span> <span data-start="238.41" data-end="242.7">any eliminates repetitive work animation</span> <span data-start="242.7" data-end="245.52">is also productivity for you because if</span> <span data-start="245.52" data-end="248.84">you are automating you are able to do</span> <span data-start="248.84" data-end="251.989">continuously development for example</span> <span data-start="251.989" data-end="255.09">whenever a file changes you run your</span> <span data-start="255.09" data-end="257.97">tests again or your build again so that</span> <span data-start="257.97" data-end="260.01">you are able to develop we are going</span> <span data-start="260.01" data-end="263.76">back and forth and you can also set that</span> <span data-start="263.76" data-end="268.229">up on the cloud and do continuous</span> <span data-start="268.229" data-end="270.419">integration which is pretty much the</span> <span data-start="270.419" data-end="273.5">same same but either it on the cloud and</span> <span data-start="273.5" data-end="275.85">rather than do it whenever a file</span> <span data-start="275.85" data-end="277.91">changes in your local system is it</span> <span data-start="277.91" data-end="282.3">whenever someone pushes new car to to</span> <span data-start="282.3" data-end="286.77">your little Reaper for instance and that</span> <span data-start="286.77" data-end="289.88">also enables you to do deployments</span> <span data-start="289.88" data-end="292.32">automatically if those builds pass in</span> <span data-start="292.32" data-end="299.37">the cloud under social performance you</span> <span data-start="299.37" data-end="302.43">get almost for free compiling bundling</span> <span data-start="302.43" data-end="307.95">minifying spriting and acid hashing</span> <span data-start="307.95" data-end="313.28">which are all almost free if you are</span> <span data-start="313.28" data-end="316.979">doing built first and if you're not you</span> <span data-start="316.979" data-end="319.56">might have to move things around a</span> <span data-start="319.56" data-end="321.15">little bit too if you're and how exactly</span> <span data-start="321.15" data-end="324.24">to make those into what you are already</span> <span data-start="324.24" data-end="328.53">doing and all of this gives you faster</span> <span data-start="328.53" data-end="332.94">response times which means your goal of</span> <span data-start="332.94" data-end="337.289">making humans happier will be easier to</span> <span data-start="337.289" data-end="342.27">thing so what tools am I going to talk</span> <span data-start="342.27" data-end="346.5">about in the old days we shall see used</span> <span data-start="346.5" data-end="350.25">to have tools like make and which were</span> <span data-start="350.25" data-end="354.99">really more of general purpose kind of</span> <span data-start="354.99" data-end="357.63">tools and now we have tools there are</span> <span data-start="357.63" data-end="359.49">more oriented to front-end developers</span> <span data-start="359.49" data-end="365.25">such as NPM grunt gulp Yemen and a bunch</span> <span data-start="365.25" data-end="367.65">of father's right that you know probably</span> <span data-start="367.65" data-end="370.38">even know their names so I'll just focus</span> <span data-start="370.38" data-end="373.95">on NPM bullpen grant but really you</span> <span data-start="373.95" data-end="377.28">should choose your own tooling and I'll</span> <span data-start="377.28" data-end="379.62">just talk about this free because they</span> <span data-start="379.62" data-end="382.47">are the ones that I use but you should</span> <span data-start="382.47" data-end="386.25">find the tools that fit what you need to</span> <span data-start="386.25" data-end="389.72">do so grunt</span> <span data-start="389.72" data-end="392.45">grant is a configuration driven bill</span> <span data-start="392.45" data-end="396.53">till it's easy to configure you just</span> <span data-start="396.53" data-end="400.25">write a big JSON object actually it's</span> <span data-start="400.25" data-end="403.55">not Jason you just write the big o</span> <span data-start="403.55" data-end="406.28">checked with maybe a couple functions or</span> <span data-start="406.28" data-end="408.8">options or wherever and you can figure</span> <span data-start="408.8" data-end="412.34">the different tasks which are made into</span> <span data-start="412.34" data-end="415.76">plugins endorse a whole bunch of clients</span> <span data-start="415.76" data-end="419.86">there's like thousands of those so you</span> <span data-start="419.86" data-end="424.64">can write also your own tasks because it</span> <span data-start="424.64" data-end="426.56">just shall escape you write the function</span> <span data-start="426.56" data-end="430.58">and that's a task the issue with grant</span> <span data-start="430.58" data-end="433.37">is that the flow tends to get to burbles</span> <span data-start="433.37" data-end="436.34">if you are trying to do something rather</span> <span data-start="436.34" data-end="440.15">large in your builds because to run a</span> <span data-start="440.15" data-end="442.82">single commenting your shell with grant</span> <span data-start="442.82" data-end="445.69">maybe it takes like six lines of code</span> <span data-start="445.69" data-end="449.6">and it's not so fast as the alternatives</span> <span data-start="449.6" data-end="454.669">maybe maybe but the truth is that during</span> <span data-start="454.669" data-end="456.44">builds unless you are going for</span> <span data-start="456.44" data-end="458.66">continuous development which you should</span> <span data-start="458.66" data-end="464.03">is it's not such big of a deal if the</span> <span data-start="464.03" data-end="467.78">bill takes a little longer so to install</span> <span data-start="467.78" data-end="470.33">grunt all you need to do is have a</span> <span data-start="470.33" data-end="474.8">package.json file the the CLI and the</span> <span data-start="474.8" data-end="478.58">local grant installation and then you</span> <span data-start="478.58" data-end="482.24">have to create a grunt file and I'm</span> <span data-start="482.24" data-end="485.08">going to show you how to do that using</span> <span data-start="485.08" data-end="489.53">by creating a a grunt file that turns a</span> <span data-start="489.53" data-end="493.13">few icons into spreadsheet so here's a</span> <span data-start="493.13" data-end="497.24">grunt file that does nothing mile</span> <span data-start="497.24" data-end="500.41">exports is the camassia syntax for</span> <span data-start="500.41" data-end="504.229">exposing an API in email and in</span> <span data-start="504.229" data-end="506.24">comerciais every file is a mile I'll</span> <span data-start="506.24" data-end="510.979">talk about that a little more later so</span> <span data-start="510.979" data-end="516.52">here I am loading a plugin with grant</span> <span data-start="516.52" data-end="519.349">and I'm initializing it with some</span> <span data-start="519.349" data-end="521.57">configuration telling it where the icons</span> <span data-start="521.57" data-end="523.2">are going to be were</span> <span data-start="523.2" data-end="526.65">the sprite sheet is going to be placed</span> <span data-start="526.65" data-end="530.19">and then where I want the CSS to be</span> <span data-start="530.19" data-end="533.67">placed too and I just run grunts pride</span> <span data-start="533.67" data-end="536.49">and I get my icons so it looks kind of</span> <span data-start="536.49" data-end="539.33">like this maybe the designer gave me a</span> <span data-start="539.33" data-end="542.13">bunch of icons and threw them in a</span> <span data-start="542.13" data-end="545.13">directory and I can't just automate the</span> <span data-start="545.13" data-end="547.32">process of creating the spreadsheet</span> <span data-start="547.32" data-end="549.03">which may be in the old days you would</span> <span data-start="549.03" data-end="553.5">just make it yourself for us your</span> <span data-start="553.5" data-end="555.99">designer to that it was a really painful</span> <span data-start="555.99" data-end="559.53">process right and you can also do way</span> <span data-start="559.53" data-end="562.29">more complicated stuff we grant how many</span> <span data-start="562.29" data-end="566.3">of you have used amazon ec2 for instance</span> <span data-start="566.3" data-end="571.11">okay a few so Amazon ec2 is a hosting</span> <span data-start="571.11" data-end="574.14">environment and you can automate the</span> <span data-start="574.14" data-end="578.13">deployment to that as well using grant i</span> <span data-start="578.13" data-end="580.77">wrote a package for grant called grantee</span> <span
