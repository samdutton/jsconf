you need to name</span> <span data-start="225.139" data-end="230.93">the exact half up front and another</span> <span data-start="230.93" data-end="234.44">difference is that with come on Jas you</span> <span data-start="234.44" data-end="237.019">actually get a copied value so if you</span> <span data-start="237.019" data-end="239.66">import a number you get a copy of that</span> <span

data-end="250.489">function so in this example when I</span> <span data-start="250.489" data-end="254.299">increment when I call increment and the</span> <span data-start="254.299" data-end="256.81">number will not actually be incremented</span> <span data-start="256.81" data-end="260.18">incremented in maine j/s because i got a</span> <span data-start="260.18" data-end="264.65">copy and with is 2015 you get life</span> <span data-start="264.65" data-end="266.75">values which means that you get the</span> <span data-start="266.75" data-end="269.75">actual value into the module scope it's</span> <span data-start="269.75" data-end="272.389">like like it has been defined in the</span> <span data-start="272.389" data-end="274.849">extra scope so that's a real difference</span> <span data-start="274.849" data-end="276.2">and you could not</span> <span data-start="276.2" data-end="279.59">really do that without the native</span> <span data-start="279.59" data-end="284.51">support these properties make is 2015</span> <span data-start="284.51" data-end="287.5">modules less flexible than comment yes</span> <span data-start="287.5" data-end="290.3">but they are also the foundation for</span> <span data-start="290.3" data-end="294.83">three shaking and three shaking is let</span> <span data-start="294.83" data-end="297.35">me explain that so for instance if you</span> <span data-start="297.35" data-end="301.46">have a module that has a value and we</span> <span data-start="301.46" data-end="303.05">have two functions increment and</span> <span data-start="303.05" data-end="306.08">decrement but we only use the function</span> <span data-start="306.08" data-end="309.29">increment so we don't really need to</span> <span data-start="309.29" data-end="313.16">include the function decrement and with</span> <span data-start="313.16" data-end="316.22">tree shaking and is 23 modules we are</span> <span data-start="316.22" data-end="319.49">able to resolve that because we can just</span> <span data-start="319.49" data-end="321.8">just by looking at the source code we</span> <span data-start="321.8" data-end="323.39">know that the function decrement is</span> <span data-start="323.39" data-end="326.12">never called so we can just remove it</span> <span data-start="326.12" data-end="328.01">from the code and this is called tree</span> <span data-start="328.01" data-end="333.59">shaking so the static nature of is 2015</span> <span data-start="333.59" data-end="335.96">modules makes it possible to trace all</span> <span data-start="335.96" data-end="340.31">the exports that are actually used but</span> <span data-start="340.31" data-end="342.56">with a static model system how do we</span> <span data-start="342.56" data-end="345.26">load things on demand that's still</span> <span data-start="345.26" data-end="347.33">important especially in the front end</span> <span data-start="347.33" data-end="352.37">and so there's another tool it's called</span> <span data-start="352.37" data-end="355.34">system import so system import all</span> <span data-start="355.34" data-end="359.08">things and that's a way to load</span> <span data-start="359.08" data-end="361.97">asynchronously and in a dynamic way and</span> <span data-start="361.97" data-end="366.26">to load modules into the program it</span> <span data-start="366.26" data-end="368.48">looks like this where you call system</span> <span data-start="368.48" data-end="371.27">import and you specify the module and</span> <span data-start="371.27" data-end="373.61">you get back a promise and of course</span> <span data-start="373.61" data-end="376.01">this could fail because network is down</span> <span data-start="376.01" data-end="377.9">or something or the money could not be</span> <span data-start="377.9" data-end="380.69">found so we have also to handle the</span> <span data-start="380.69" data-end="386.87">error but unfortunately things aren't</span> <span data-start="386.87" data-end="390.95">finalized yet so that's because system</span> <span data-start="390.95" data-end="393.4">import is very platform specific and</span> <span data-start="393.4" data-end="395.78">many things need to be consistent</span> <span data-start="395.78" data-end="398.15">considered so system import works</span> <span data-start="398.15" data-end="400.31">different in node then it works in the</span> <span data-start="400.31" data-end="403.04">browser so it's hard to get these things</span> <span data-start="403.04" data-end="407.72">right and that's why the tc39 decided to</span> <span data-start="407.72" data-end="408.62">exclude</span> <span data-start="408.62" data-end="412.21">is 2015 and it is now currently</span> <span data-start="412.21" data-end="416.63">specified as separate loader standard so</span> <span data-start="416.63" data-end="418.43">once we can load more is natively in the</span> <span data-start="418.43" data-end="420.139">browser do we need tools like browser</span> <span data-start="420.139" data-end="424.19">fire or web pack anymore well to answer</span> <span data-start="424.19" data-end="426.35">this question we should take a look at</span> <span data-start="426.35" data-end="428.3">another technology first and this is</span>
