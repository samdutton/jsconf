data-start="17.279" data-end="21.84">which is a uniform interface to main</span> <span data-start="21.84" data-end="25.08">data so it should make interacting with</span> <span data-start="25.08" data-end="28.26">the main data easier for us JavaScript</span> <span data-start="28.26" data-end="32.899">programmers at work at classic pacheco</span> <span data-start="32.899" data-end="35.73">in Linz which is an office sharing</span> <span data-start="35.73" data-end="40.73">project we launched in 2008 and yeah</span> <span data-start="40.73" data-end="45.75">let's jump into the topic I'm gonna give</span> <span data-start="45.75" data-end="48.48">you some background at first so how this</span> <span data-start="48.48" data-end="52.1">all started back in October last year</span> <span data-start="52.1" data-end="56.489">we'll cover the most fundamental data</span> <span data-start="56.489" data-end="60.42">structures or concepts of theta chess</span> <span data-start="60.42" data-end="63.92">which are graphs notes objects and types</span> <span data-start="63.92" data-end="70.2">will have a brief look at the API will</span> <span data-start="70.2" data-end="75.93">cover persistence so persistence is like</span> <span data-start="75.93" data-end="79.53">a drop in support so you don't have to</span> <span data-start="79.53" data-end="82.71">use it but you can so it will be</span> <span data-start="82.71" data-end="86.82">possible to to store data on the server</span> <span data-start="86.82" data-end="88.259">side back end without writing</span> <span data-start="88.259" data-end="92.34">server-side code actually we will cover</span> <span data-start="92.34" data-end="96.299">offline applications also then I will</span> <span data-start="96.299" data-end="99.84">give you a demo of substance I all which</span> <span data-start="99.84" data-end="101.729">is actually the application that drives</span> <span data-start="101.729" data-end="106.35">such data chairs development so we'll</span> <span data-start="106.35" data-end="109.829">have a look at this and finally we will</span> <span data-start="109.829" data-end="113.79">build a data J's client so that show you</span> <span data-start="113.79" data-end="117.36">how the</span> <span data-start="117.37" data-end="124.36">how the API works basically so as set</span> <span data-start="124.36" data-end="126.01">data she has developed in the context of</span> <span data-start="126.01" data-end="129.34">substance which is a web-based document</span> <span data-start="129.34" data-end="134.05">publishing engine that's how it looks</span> <span data-start="134.05" data-end="140.64">like the idea was the following arm</span> <span data-start="140.64" data-end="142.9">substance is dedicated to manipulating</span> <span data-start="142.9" data-end="145.78">documents right in the browser and as</span> <span data-start="145.78" data-end="148.36">you know documents are usually composed</span> <span data-start="148.36" data-end="153.31">sequentially like you start on top right</span> <span data-start="153.31" data-end="156.03">your text and to format into it to</span> <span data-start="156.03" data-end="159.78">structure in and add stash and in format</span> <span data-start="159.78" data-end="165.16">but um the idea was to do it that a</span> <span data-start="165.16" data-end="168.7">little bit differently so we split up</span> <span data-start="168.7" data-end="172.45">this document into its integral parts so</span> <span data-start="172.45" data-end="175.48">to say so we have a top-level the root</span> <span data-start="175.48" data-end="177.94">node the document content node so to say</span> <span data-start="177.94" data-end="180.64">which then consists the section and</span> <span data-start="180.64" data-end="185.17">image or a text node so what we are</span> <span data-start="185.17" data-end="187.27">ending up with is the data structure</span> <span data-start="187.27" data-end="190.209">that looks like this one which is</span> <span data-start="190.209" data-end="192.7">basically in the case of the document a</span> <span data-start="192.7" data-end="195.67">tree but there could also be back</span> <span data-start="195.67" data-end="198.67">references so what we are looking here</span> <span data-start="198.67" data-end="201.75">at is basically a graph data structure</span> <span data-start="201.75" data-end="206.47">and that's actually what data chest is</span> <span data-start="206.47" data-end="209.23">all about it's an object model that fits</span> <span data-start="209.23" data-end="211.84">on top of graph data so graph data is a</span> <span data-start="211.84" data-end="214.239">low level data structure in computer</span> <span data-start="214.239" data-end="218.16">science and we build sort of an API or</span> <span data-start="218.16" data-end="220.36">abstraction layer on top of it so it's</span> <span data-start="220.36" data-end="224.5">easier for us to interact with it data</span> <span data-start="224.5" data-end="228.34">chasis in-memory data manipulation so</span> <span data-start="228.34" data-end="230.709">you're basically manipulating and</span> <span data-start="230.709" data-end="233.35">interacting with a local in-memory data</span> <span data-start="233.35" data-end="236.2">structure which can then be persisted to</span> <span data-start="236.2" data-end="237.7">the server at some point so that's the</span> <span data-start="237.7" data-end="240.85">persistence layer then it provides the</span> <span data-start="240.85" data-end="243.82">exact same API on server side and on the</span> <span data-start="243.82" data-end="249.52">client side so you can reuse code</span> <span data-start="249.52" data-end="252.22">written basically it also features a GUI</span> <span data-start="252.22" data-end="258.91">interface for local and remote data this</span> <span data-start="258.91" data-end="260.83">library is inspired by the concept of</span> <span data-start="260.83" data-end="264.61">the Semantic Web which is basically also</span> <span data-start="264.61" data-end="272.38">based on on graph data so you know the</span> <span data-start="272.38" data-end="278.29">resource description framework that sort</span> <span data-start="278.29" data-end="281.08">of acted as an inspiration and there's</span> <span data-start="281.08" data-end="284.68">this project freebase dot-com I'll know</span> <span data-start="284.68" data-end="287.32">if you have seen this they have been</span> <span data-start="287.32" data-end="291.76">acquired by Google lately they also use</span> <span data-start="291.76" data-end="293.17">the concept of semantic web but they</span> <span data-start="293.17" data-end="298.24">stripped it like down to a simpler API</span> <span data-start="298.24" data-end="302.32">which is chasing based or not xml stuff</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="302.32" data-end="305.08">I also took some inspiration from under</span> <span data-start="305.08" data-end="310.47">scratches so where are the use cases um</span> <span data-start="310.47" data-end="315.88">you could for example um build data</span> <span data-start="315.88" data-end="319.6">analysis and visualization tools on top</span> <span data-start="319.6" data-end="324.82">of stata chest framework so I don't have</span> <span data-start="324.82" data-end="326.29">enough time to show you this project</span> <span data-start="326.29" data-end="330.16">life but what we see here is you can you</span> <span data-start="330.16" data-end="332.47">can check it out yourself then what you</span> <span data-start="332.47" data-end="338.5">see here is a visualization that shows</span> <span data-start="338.5" data-end="344.76">and that that aggregates and filters</span> <span data-start="344.76" data-end="347.53">data that are pulled from from github</span> <span data-start="347.53" data-end="354.669">and it's aggregated it's represented as</span> <span data-start="354.669" data-end="358.09">data object this data from github about</span> <span data-start="358.09" data-end="363.18">top thousand not just repositories and</span> <span data-start="363.18" data-end="366.75">the filtering and the aggregation is</span> <span data-start="366.75" data-end="371.05">performed in memory so you click on on a</span> <span data-start="371.05" data-end="373.75">certain aspect of the data and you</span> <span data-start="373.75" data-end="376.21">immediately see the results check it out</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="376.21" data-end="380.53">I said it could also be used for offline</span> <span data-start="380.53" data-end="383.409">applications there's an example at task</span> <span data-start="383.409" data-end="386.289">stop substance that I oh so you can</span> <span data-start="386.289" data-end="388.749">check out that as well so this deals</span> <span data-start="388.749" data-end="391.839">with the problems of offline</span> <span data-start="391.839" data-end="393.55">applications like synchronization and</span> <span data-start="393.55" data-end="398.289">conflict management so let's have a look</span> <span data-start="398.289" data-end="405.209">at the anatomy of the data graph it</span> <span data-start="405.209" data-end="410.259">basically consists of data nodes which</span> <span data-start="410.259" data-end="415.839">can either be an object or a type so</span> <span data-start="415.839" data-end="418.259">data nodes are then connected through</span> <span data-start="418.259" data-end="423.519">properties so they reference each other</span> <span data-start="423.519" data-end="427.419">basically each data node has a type</span> <span data-start="427.419" data-end="432.399">property which describes which type so</span> <span data-start="432.399" data-end="438.489">to say which class is a member of in</span> <span data-start="438.489" data-end="442.419">this example we've some example data</span> <span data-start="442.419" data-end="445.839">from from a document model and we also</span> <span data-start="445.839" data-end="449.559">include a user data structure here so a</span> <span data-start="449.559" data-end="452.829">document has a creator which points to a</span> <span data-start="452.829" data-end="457.149">user objects in the graph space also it</span> <span data-start="457.149" data-end="460.709">contains the section or more and</span> <span data-start="460.709" data-end="463.479">connects this with the children property</span> <span data-start="463.479" data-end="465.939">which is a non unique property which</span> <span data-start="465.939" data-end="472.54">means can have more than one value</span> <span data-start="472.55" data-end="478.09">so all all data nodes in the graph share</span> <span data-start="478.09" data-end="481.07">certain set of properties which are the</span> </p>

a</span> <span data-start="747.699" data-end="750.759">quick look at how filters work so in the</span> <span data-start="750.759" data-end="754.329">case a user is trying to save two nodes</span>
