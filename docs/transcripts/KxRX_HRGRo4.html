<p><span data-start="54.229" data-end="56.239">I spent the past many years in the</span> <span data-start="56.239" data-end="57.709">community doing a lot of diff tools kind</span> <span data-start="57.709" data-end="59.269">of hacking and then this year joined</span> <span data-start="59.269" data-end="61.369">Microsoft to do it as a full-time paid</span> <span data-start="61.369"

every day so I'm basically here to</span> <span data-start="68.45" data-end="70.67">talk about how we think about the future</span> <span data-start="70.67" data-end="72.44">for furtive tools and how we think about</span> <span data-start="72.44" data-end="74.15">we can maybe do things a bit in a</span> <span data-start="74.15" data-end="76.64">different way but first I would like to</span> <span data-start="76.64" data-end="79.76">quite a bit of context I am on the web</span> <span data-start="79.76" data-end="81.74">platform and and how we need to think</span> <span data-start="81.74" data-end="85.1">about dev tools and going forward so I</span> <span data-start="85.1" data-end="86.51">think it's pretty clear for all of us</span> <span data-start="86.51" data-end="89.15">that we all real big developer Joel</span> <span data-start="89.15" data-end="90.68">using javascript and but the big</span> <span data-start="90.68" data-end="92.62">platform has changed quite significantly</span> <span data-start="92.62" data-end="94.91">over the past I would say five years</span> <span data-start="94.91" data-end="97.16">like when I started building from the</span> <span

data-end="102.77">basically like that's why we have</span> <span data-start="102.77" data-end="104.54">hypertext markup language to do a</span> <span data-start="104.54" data-end="106.58">scientific

data-start="118.909" data-end="120.71">every day and which actually quite a</span> <span data-start="120.71" data-end="122.21">complicated application when you think</span> <span data-start="122.21" data-end="125.27">about it and even if you look at the</span> <span data-start="125.27" data-end="126.86">devices we're using each and every day</span> <span data-start="126.86" data-end="130.369">they've also changed and I remember like</span> <span data-start="130.369" data-end="133.41">the good old workstation Mac or like the</span> <span data-start="133.41" data-end="135.21">the good old laptop I had plenty of</span> <span data-start="135.21" data-end="137.01">these with the noble guys over the years</span> <span data-start="137.01" data-end="140.07">so like if you look at the devices were</span> <span data-start="140.07" data-end="142.02">using today they at least from Microsoft</span> <span data-start="142.02" data-end="143.34">they look quite a bit different we have</span> <span data-start="143.34" data-end="144.9">like service to studios all about</span> <span data-start="144.9" data-end="147.12">charged surface where services if used

data-start="151.02" data-end="153.12">being this workstation kind of thing to</span> <span data-start="153.12" data-end="154.58">something thats a bit more mobile and</span> <span data-start="154.58" data-end="158.19">and really when we talk about the what</span> <span data-start="158.19" data-end="159.9">devices people are using to browse the</span> <span data-start="159.9" data-end="162.33">web it's really about mobile devices and</span> <span data-start="162.33" data-end="165.15">like today mobile phones and then large</span> <span data-start="165.15" data-end="167.04">phones tablets kind of thing comes in a</span> <span data-start="167.04" data-end="168.81">lot of different sizes and that's been a</span> <span data-start="168.81" data-end="170.19">lot of stuff happening in terms of i</span> <span data-start="170.19" data-end="172.8">remember my good old naka 3210 that way</span> <span data-start="172.8" data-end="175.2">i could play snake to like my my iphone</span> <span

data-end="187.47">has changed like today we have like</span> <span data-start="187.47" data-end="189.6">chrome as a market leader we actually</span> <span data-start="189.6" data-end="192.81">have safari a hat with if we include</span> <span data-start="192.81" data-end="195.42">like a iPads as a pretty significant</span> <span data-start="195.42" data-end="197.04">disk top market share because the ipass</span> <span data-start="197.04" data-end="199.92">are grown so big today and and then we</span> <span data-start="199.92" data-end="201.36">have like if you look at our market</span> <span data-start="201.36" data-end="203.85">share like for Microsoft our itch marga</span> <span data-start="203.85" data-end="205.74">chair still growing we're still trying</span> <span data-start="205.74" data-end="208.11">to kill the remaining bits of IE but one</span> <span data-start="208.11" data-end="210.78">day I'm sure we will succeed and so like</span> <span data-start="210.78" data-end="212.64">that this desktop landscape has changed</span> <span data-start="212.64" data-end="215.31">quite a bit and I just want to touch</span> <span data-start="215.31"

I've actually reinvesting in the web</span> <span data-start="223.65" data-end="226.56">then we decided to kill I we doing edge</span> <span data-start="226.56" data-end="229.44">and that was basically because what</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="229.44" data-end="230.97">Microsoft did previously was basically</span> <span data-start="230.97" data-end="233.16">just Mike dropping out of the the stage</span> <span data-start="233.16" data-end="234.75">after doing re 6 because there was an</span> <span data-start="234.75" data-end="237.06">awesome browser at least back then and</span> <span data-start="237.06" data-end="239.13">but we're basically reinventing or</span> <span data-start="239.13" data-end="242.67">trying to reinvent a our approach to how</span> <span data-start="242.67" data-end="246.93">we build for the web and and another</span> <span data-start="246.93" data-end="248.55">interesting thing we look alike our</span> <span data-start="248.55" data-end="250.86">devices has changed our

data-start="273.15" data-end="275.52">use in when they go online and we need</span> <span data-start="275.52" data-end="277.169">to think about this when we build our</span> <span data-start="277.169" data-end="279.3">websites when we optimize our user</span> <span data-start="279.3" data-end="280.65">experiences but also when we build our</span> <span data-start="280.65" data-end="284.37">tools and it's just another interesting</span> <span data-start="284.37" data-end="286.05">fact that I think many people tend to</span> <span data-start="286.05" data-end="287.52">forget it's like that's

and then vs code connects to to</span> <span data-start="986.84" data-end="988.4">to chrome and you can set your break</span> <span data-start="988.4" data-end="991.07">point straight from your editor
