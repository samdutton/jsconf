right there so you want to know</span> <span data-start="71.59" data-end="74.19">anything about the state feel free to</span> <span data-start="74.19" data-end="80.02">check out this website Google and I can</span> <span data-start="80.02" data-end="84.729">help you out with that but so this is</span> <span data-start="84.729" data-end="88.33">jas cough and javascript doesn't have</span> <span data-start="88.33" data-end="90.88">types but let me motivate you a little</span> <span data-start="90.88" data-end="96.43">bit this was a bad year for software</span> <span data-start="96.43" data-end="99.72">engineering there was the go-to fail</span> <span data-start="99.72" data-end="102.19">then there's also something called</span> <span data-start="102.19" data-end="107.17">heartbleed

data-end="133.09">these opportunities for failure so</span> <span data-start="133.09" data-end="136.45">been that we're horrible at exercising</span> <span data-start="136.45" data-end="141.19">these unhappy these unhappy paths code</span> <span data-start="141.19" data-end="143.65">reviewers QA the open source community</span> <span data-start="143.65" data-end="146.379">even missed these these bugs that were</span> <span data-start="146.379" data-end="148.989">in the software we have to rely more on</span> <span data-start="148.989" data-end="152.43">computers or computer friends who are</span> <span data-start="152.43" data-end="155.83">relentlessly unforgiving and which is a</span> <span data-start="155.83" data-end="156.91">good quality to have when you're</span> <span data-start="156.91" data-end="160.629">reviewing software so this talk is</span> <span data-start="160.629" data-end="162.37">titled armchair type theory so of course</span> <span data-start="162.37" data-end="164.26">we're going to be talking about type</span> <span data-start="164.26" data-end="166.84">theory you can kind of see in the</span> <span data-start="166.84" data-end="168.579">background there that's Bertrand Russell</span> <span data-start="168.579" data-end="170.65">he invented type theory to basically</span> <span data-start="170.65" data-end="176.22">solve a bug in formal logic so in</span> <span data-start="176.22" data-end="178.39">programming languages we use type theory</span> <span data-start="178.39" data-end="182.26">to develop type systems and you can if</span> <span data-start="182.26" data-end="183.579">you're not familiar with type systems</span> <span data-start="183.579" data-end="185.95">you can basically think of it as like</span> <span data-start="185.95" data-end="189.34">j/s hint on steroids so it'll it'll</span> <span data-start="189.34" data-end="194.049">actually it's actually part of part of</span> <span data-start="194.049" data-end="195.849">the language usually languages I have</span> <span data-start="195.849" data-end="197.29">type systems they embedded in the</span> <span data-start="197.29" data-end="199.66">language but it's also static analysis</span> <span data-start="199.66" data-end="207.069">to it so and nothing short of running</span> <span data-start="207.069" data-end="208.389">the actual program will guarantee is</span> <span data-start="208.389" data-end="211.84">correct but type systems provide a way</span> <span data-start="211.84" data-end="215.47">to narrow the scope of what's a valid</span> <span data-start="215.47" data-end="217.989">program sort of the same way that your</span> <span data-start="217.989" data-end="221.5">parser will narrow the scope based on</span> <span data-start="221.5" data-end="224.019">the grammar of the language the system</span> <span data-start="224.019" data-end="226.93">will narrow it further using extra</span>

data-start="231.669" data-end="236.27">something you only do with a type system</span> <span data-start="236.28" data-end="239.23">but of course there'll be trade-offs so</span> <span data-start="239.23" data-end="242.799">if you're trying to do something</span> <span data-start="242.799" data-end="246.609">dangerous or anything with safeties</span> <span data-start="246.609" data-end="248.049">built-in is going to make it harder for</span> <span data-start="248.049" data-end="251.049">you to do like certain things that's</span> <span data-start="251.049" data-end="252.549">part of the trade-offs you have to make</span> <span data-start="252.549" data-end="254.44">and I'll talk about that more when we</span> <span data-start="254.44" data-end="258.01">get into things that are relevant to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="258.01" data-end="261.37">JavaScript like pure script and</span> <span data-start="261.37" data-end="264.219">typescript because of course JavaScript</span> <span data-start="264.219" data-end="266.139">itself doesn't have static types</span> <span data-start="266.139" data-end="267.789">it does have these cool number types</span> <span data-start="267.789" data-end="270.99">like Brian mentioned but nothing</span> <span data-start="270.99" data-end="273.699">resembling static typing unless you</span> <span data-start="273.699" data-end="276.43">count as an j s which is sort of like a</span> <span data-start="276.43" data-end="280.749">clever reuse of operators to act as like</span> <span data-start="280.749" data-end="283.719">a static typing hint for language for</span> <span data-start="283.719" data-end="287.379">edges that understand it at least but</span> <span data-start="287.379" data-end="288.699">it's not really relevant to javascript</span> <span data-start="288.699" data-end="295.18">in general so we have these new</span> <span data-start="295.18" data-end="296.439">languages that have been developed that</span> <span data-start="296.439" data-end="297.909">compile to JavaScript and these ones</span> <span data-start="297.909" data-end="299.889">especially target JavaScript as their</span> <span data-start="299.889" data-end="303.46">back-end so typescript of course has</span> <span data-start="303.46" data-end="305.439">been around for a while I'm sure your</span> <span data-start="305.439" data-end="306.789">most of you are familiar with it then</span> <span data-start="306.789" data-end="308.409">there's also something called cure</span> <span data-start="308.409" data-end="311.529">script which is newer and it resembles</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.529" data-end="314.349">Haskell and also elm is a really cool</span> <span data-start="314.349" data-end="317.65">language that it's also similar to</span> <span

data-end="332.86">doesn't want that of learning a purely</span> <span data-start="332.86" data-end="335.229">functional language so but we're going</span> <span data-start="335.229" data-end="339.089">to focus on typescript of care script</span> <span data-start="339.089" data-end="342.729">and i'll i'm not going to get into</span> <span data-start="342.729" data-end="346.36">actual type theory sorry for you those</span> <span data-start="346.36" data-end="349.36">of you who came to this 930 talk ajs</span> <span data-start="349.36" data-end="351.159">comp to actually learn about this stuff</span> <span data-start="351.159" data-end="356.71">but we can sort of format using this</span> <span data-start="356.71" data-end="360.49">metaphor instead basically what the type</span> <span data-start="360.49" data-end="362.949">system is doing for most most type</span> <span data-start="362.949" data-end="364.719">systems that we use and popular</span> <span data-start="364.719" data-end="367.36">programming languages to have them they</span> <span data-start="367.36" data-end="371.56">basically look at the value the shape of</span> <span data-start="371.56" data-end="374.56">the value at different parts of the</span> <span data-start="374.56" data-end="377.319">program where it's passing through like</span> <span data-start="377.319" data-end="380.849">functions function application operators</span> <span data-start="380.849"

data-end="386.83">function or operator it'll check the</span> <span data-start="386.83" data-end="389.289">value and make sure it performs as the</span> <span data-start="389.289" data-end="391.599">shape so these blocks are representing</span> <span data-start="391.599" data-end="393.43">the values of them the holes and this</span> <span data-start="393.43" data-end="396.19">block here are the API boundaries where</span> <span data-start="396.19" data-end="398.87">that values being passed around</span> <span data-start="398.87" data-end="401.54">and here's an example of typescript</span> <span data-start="401.54" data-end="404.48">where you'll see this is like a function</span> <span data-start="404.48" data-end="407.36">but it also has typing

<span data-start="442.97" data-end="444.77">you're using like something like Haskell</span> <span data-start="444.77" data-end="448.07">or pure script it's guaranteed to be a</span> <span

data-end="455.39">it it's also done statically so you</span> <span data-start="455.39" data-end="457.31">don't have to actually run make sure you</span> <span data-start="457.31" data-end="458.6">have a hundred percent code coverage and</span> <span data-start="458.6" data-end="461.21">you actually run the program so you'll</span> <span data-start="461.21" data-end="464.78">be able to catch errors faster as you</span> <span data-start="464.78" data-end="466.97">notice types another way to look at it</span> <span data-start="466.97" data-end="472.13">is the compiler is sort of running a</span> <span data-start="472.13" data-end="475.07">simpler Dumber version of your program</span> <span data-start="475.07" data-end="477.22">at compile time the type checker is</span> <span data-start="477.22" data-end="479.99">reading the ast taking the types and</span> <span data-start="479.99" data-end="482.51">sort of running a computations on the</span> <span data-start="482.51" data-end="484.73">types themselves to make sure that that</span> <span data-start="484.73" data-end="487.43">passes then once you do that it's like</span> <span data-start="487.43" data-end="491.3">you have a formula you have like a proof</span> <span data-start="491.3" data-end="497.54">of your program so programs we want</span> <span data-start="497.54" data-end="501.71">programs i can prove themselves sorry</span> <span data-start="501.71" data-end="504.56">for this next we've got programs i can</span> <span data-start="504.56"

data-end="513.68">want to be able to sweep the leg sort of</span> <span data-start="513.68" data-end="517.15">say on certain classes of bugs and</span> <span data-start="517.15" data-end="519.11">depending on the type system you'll be</span> <span data-start="519.11" data-end="521.51">able to eliminate those bugs from your</span> <span data-start="521.51" data-end="526.1">programs basically so sorry no more no</span> <span data-start="526.1" data-end="527.57">more of these craddock you references</span> <span data-start="527.57" data-end="533.39">i'm sorry but yeah so they're of course</span> <span data-start="533.39" data-end="533.96">they're going to be trade-offs</span> <span data-start="533.96" data-end="536.12">especially the different types is you</span> <span data-start="536.12" data-end="539.3">might notice that c-sharp java and</span> <span data-start="539.3" data-end="540.92">haskell have like completely</span> <span data-start="540.92" data-end="543.11">different-looking type field the field</span> <span data-start="543.11" data-end="544.37">of the type system is different and</span> <span data-start="544.37" data-end="546.77">that's also the case of typescript in</span> <span data-start="546.77" data-end="549.71">pure script it's basically like a Java C</span> <span data-start="549.71" data-end="552.7">sharp past versus Haskell classic 00 p</span> <span data-start="552.7" data-end="557.72">which is purely functional but what's</span> <span data-start="557.72" data-end="559.85">interesting about typescript is of</span> <span data-start="559.85" data-end="561.62">course it's a superset of javascript so</span> <span data-start="561.62" data-end="563.72">you can take a standard JavaScript</span> <span data-start="563.72" data-end="567.92">program and sort of incrementally add</span> <span data-start="567.92" data-end="571.25">types to it if you want so
